This approach allows hardware devices such asthe monome to act as an extended hardware interface withthe same power to initiate and control musical processesas a bespoke programming language. Finally, we reflect onthe structure of the collaborative project itself, which offers an opportunity to discuss general research strategy forconducting highly sophisticated technical research within aperforming arts environment such as the development of apersonal regime of preparation for performance.},

  abstract = {The close relationship between touch, gesture, and sound plays a critical role in expressive musical performance. Many acoustic instruments, ranging from strings to brass to percussion, involve some coupling of the ``feel'' of the instrument in the hands and the corresponding sound produced. The singing voice, however, is one of few musical instruments that typically does not involve touch-mediated interaction. Despite several neurological, psychological, and social connections demonstrated between the hands and voice, the coupling of touch and voice is surprisingly absent from traditional vocal performance technologies. This provides the motivation for VocalCords, which explores the design of a new digital music interface inviting tactile interaction and performance with the singing voice. The interface makes use of physical rubber cords, acting as stretch sensors, which are pulled and manipulated by the hands of the singer as they vocalize to augment and modify their voice in real-time -- as if they were able to physically ``touch'' their own vocal cords. This approach allows for expressive, tactile control over the singing voice, which suggests a striking relationship between physical and musical tension. Through a series of prototyping iterations and a public performance with the interface, I explore the potential of touch-mediated vocal performance, as well as how this added tactile interaction may alter our experience with, and perception of, our singing voices.}

We designed two tactile cues to augment the stroke across the control surface: a static and dynamic cue. The static cue was a simple burst of vibration triggered when crossing the control surface. The dynamic cue was continuous vibration increasing in amplitude when approaching the surface. We arranged an experiment to study the influence of the tactile cues in performance. In a tempo follow task, the dynamic cue yielded significantly the best temporal and periodic accuracy and control of movement velocity and amplitude. The static cue did not significantly improve the rhythmic accuracy but assisted the control of movement velocity compared to the condition without tactile feedback at all. The findings of the study indicate that careful design of dynamic vibrotactile feedback can improve the controllability of gesture based virtual instrument.},

Instead of processing the music audio, the system performs the transcription only from the video performance captured by a camera mounted over the piano keyboard. claVision can be used as a transcription tool, but it also has other applications such as music education. The claVision software has a very high accuracy (over 95\%) and a very low latency in real-time music transcription, even under different illumination conditions.}

  abstract = {Traditional Human-Computer Interaction has often been critiqued for its ostensibly opaque position on ethical, ontological, and epistemological concerns, particularly in relation to completed design artifacts. More recently, similar criticisms have been directed at the New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) community for its relative silence on contemporary political issues. However, it is possible that an implicit ethics of material culture is already embedded within NIME discourse --- one that could be critically examined and potentially mobilized as a foundation for a more explicitly political ethics.Inspired by feminist discourse, namely Karen Barad's theory of agential realism, and contextualized through Bruno Latour's remarks regarding the ethics of design, this paper explores the possibilities of entanglement in DMI design. We begin with a discussion of diffraction and entanglement followed by a brief overview of values-oriented and "world-building" theoretical models and methodologies of design research. We continue with our generative "DMI-as-apparatus" approach to diffractive methodology and conclude with a case study BRAIDS\_, a digital music instrument based upon the Black American cultural practice of hair braiding, that examines critical design decisions that are otherwise deemed invisible by traditional methods of scientific inquiry.}

Through a mobile device interface, musical participants, or agents, have a degree of input into the generated music essentially defining the sound of a given region. The audio landscape is superimposed onto the physical one. The resultant musical experience is not tied simply to the passage of time, but through the incorporation of participants over time and spatial proximity, it becomes an aural location as much as a piece of music.

We have designed and produced a system that uses S/PDIF as the transport mechanism for a sensor interface. This provides robust performance, together with extremely low latency and high resolution. In our system, data from all sensors is multiplexed onto the digital audio line and demultiplexed in software on the computer using standard techniques.

First, as a proof of concept, we report on the findings of an initial on-line survey among 37 musicians and 32 non-musicians evaluating the feasibility and validity of our approach. We show that our representation is understandable and that there are no significant differences between musicians and non-musicians. Second, we evaluated the approach in a real world scenario based on a Skype plug-in. In a field study with 14 participants we showed that sonified text messages strongly impact on the users' message checking behavior by significantly reducing the time between receiving and reading an incoming message.},

Our preliminary study with seven traditional musicians reveals that they find playing with the system to be enjoyable, and appreciated its musicality; but they scored its humanness and responsiveness less highly. These findings suggest that such real-time performance systems might bring an enjoyable "otherness" to musical performance, even for traditional forms of music. Finally, we discuss experimental considerations for a future study involving more participants.}

This approach utilizes Max/MSP to allow any player an easy and low cost way to apply and experiment innovative music interfaces for live performance, without losing the professionalism required on stage. In that approach, every 1-3 players is plugged to a unit consisting of a standard sound-card and laptop. This unit is controlled by an interface that schedules and manages all the digital sounds made by each player (VST effects, VST instruments and 'home-made' interactive interfaces). All the player's units are then remotely controlled by a conductor patch which is in charge of the synchronization of all the players and background samples in real time, as well as providing sensitive metronome and scheduling visual enhancement. Moreover, and not less important, we can take the advantage of using virtual instruments and virtual effects in Max environment to manage the mix, and routing the audio. This providing monitors and metronome to the players ears, and virtual mixing via Max/MSP patch. This privilege almost eliminates the dependency in the venue's equipment, and in that way, the sound quality and music ideas can be taken out directly from the studio to the stage.}

Taking the composer's notes as a starting point, we have developed a complete interactive 3D model of Grisey's Talea (1986). Our model presents a novel approach to music education and theory by making understanding of complex musical structures accessible to students and non-musicians, particularly those who struggle with traditional means of learning or whose mode of learning is predominantly visual. The model builds on the foundations of 1) the historical associations between visual and musical arts and those concerning spectralists in particular 2) evidence of recurring cross-modal associations in the general population and consistent associations for individual synesthetes. Research into educational uses of the model is a topic for future exploration.}

Most of these arrange notes in chromatic half-steps along the horizontal axis and in intervals of fourths along the vertical axis. Although many alternatives exist, this arrangement, which resembles that of a bass guitar, is quickly becoming the de facto standard. In this study we present experimental evidence that grid based instruments are significantly easier to play when we tune adjacent rows in Major thirds rather than fourths. We have developed a grid-based instrument as an iPad app that has sold 8,000 units since 2012. To test our proposed alternative tuning, we taught a group twenty new users to play basic chords on our app, using both the standard tuning and our proposed alternative. Our results show that the Major thirds tuning is much easier to learn, even for users that have previous experience playing guitar.}

Scenes that make it possible for the user to select, explore and recreate different ``sound worlds'' with the tangible interface as an instrument; create and play with it as a friend; improvise and create; or relax with it as an ambient sounding furniture. We continue discussing a user story, how the Scenes are recreated by amateur users, persons with severe disabilities and family members; improvising with the mobile tangibles. We discuss composition techniques for mixing sound, tangible-physical and lighting elements in the Scenes. Based on observations we explore how a diverse audience in the family and at school can recreate and improvise their own sound experience and play together with others. We conclude by discussing the possible impact of our findings for the NIME-community; how the techniques of decomposing, recomposing and recreating sound, based on a relational perspective, could contribute to the design of new instruments for musical expression.}

This is because of important features of IEC, like the ability of optimizing with ambiguous evaluation measures, and not requiring special knowledge about art-creation. With the popularity of Consumer Generated Media, many beginners in term of art-creation are interested in creating their own original art works. Thus developing of useful IEC system for musical creation is an urgent task. However, user-assist functions for IEC proposed in pastworks decrease the possibility of getting good unexpected results, which is an important feature of art-creation with IEC. In this paper, The author proposes a new IEC evaluation process named "Shopping Basket" procedure IEC. In the procedure, an user-assist function called Similarity-Based Reasoning allows for natural evaluation by the user. The function reduces user's burden without reducing the possibility of unexpected results. The author performs an experiment where subjects use the new interface to validate it. As a result of the experiment, the author concludes that the new interface is better to motivate users to compose with IEC system than the old interface.},

The produced tones retain the identifiable timbres of the ambient sounds. Tones generated using input sounds from various environments, such as sea waves, leaves rustle and traffic noise, are analyzed. A configuration for a live in-situ performance is described, consisting of live streaming the produced sounds. In this configuration, the environment itself acts as a `performer' of sorts, alongside the Aeolis player, providing both real-time input signals and complementary visual cues.}

A pendulum having a magnetic bob is suspended inside the liquid in the wine glass. The pendulum is put into oscillation by driving infra-sound signals through the coil. The pendulum's movement causes the liquid in the glass to slosh back and forth. Simultaneously, wine glass sounds are produced by driving audio-range signals through the coil, inducing vibrations in a small magnet attached to the glass surface and exciting glass vibrations. As the glass vibrates, the sloshing liquid periodically changes the glass's resonance frequencies and dampens the glass, thus modulating both wine glass pitch and sound intensity.}

Toolkits made of modular components usefully constrain exploration towards simple, quick and functional combinations, and methods such as sketching and model-making alternatively allow imagination and narrative to guide exploration. In this work we sought to investigate a context where these approaches to exploration were combined. We designed a craft workshop for 20 musical instrument designers, where groups were given the same partly-finished instrument to craft for one hour with raw materials, and though the task was open ended, they were prompted to focus on subtle details that might distinguish their instruments. Despite the prompt the groups diverged dramatically in intent and style, and generated gestural language rapidly and flexibly. By the end, each group had developed a distinctive approach to constraint, exploratory style, collaboration and interpretation of the instrument and workshop materials. We reflect on this outcome to discuss advantages and disadvantages to integrating digital musical instrument design tools and methods, and how to further investigate and extend this approach.},

However, not all provide applicable design suggestions, especially where subtle but important details are concerned. Using traditional lutherie as a model, we conducted a series of interviews to explore how violin makers ``go beyond the obvious'', and how players perceive and describe subtle details of instrumental quality. We find that lutherie frameworks provide clear design methods and have substantial empirical backing, but are not enough to make a fine violin. Success comes after acquiring sufficient tacit knowledge, which enables detailed craft through subjective, empirical methods. Testing instruments for subtle qualities was suggested to be a different skill to playing. Whilst players are able to identify some specific details about instrumental quality by comparison, these are often not actionable, and important aspects of ``sound and feeling'' are much more difficult to describe. In the DMI domain, we introduce NIMEcraft to describe subtle differences between otherwise identical instruments and their underlying design processes, and consider how to improve the dissemination of NIMEcraft.}

These encounters have informed and challenged our research practices, mapped our surroundings, and embedded us in the local social fabric.

These nuances, and the processes they result from, cannot be fully articulated in words alone, yet they largely define an instrument's quality, and it is therefore important to understand how they come to be. We introduce a scale-based ontology that divides design details into three levels - macro, meso and micro - and we present a literature review of DMI design from the perspective of this ontology. Finally we extrapolate the ontology to consider its utility in broader contexts, and consider future directions.}

Though insightful, these accounts are imprecise, incomparable, and inefficient for understanding how fluency with the subtle details of digital musical instruments (DMIs) develops. We have been designing DMI design probes and activities for closed and constrained observation of subtle and detailed DMI design, but in two previous studies these failed to motivate subtle and detailed responses. In this paper we report on our third attempt, where we designed a tuned percussion DMI and a hybrid handcraft tool for sculpting its sound using clay, and a one hour activity. Among 26 study participants were digital luthiers, violin luthiers and musicians, who all engaged with what we define as micro scale DMI design. We observed technical desires and needs for experiencing and comparing subtle details systematically, and also widely varying, subjective emotional and artistic relationships with detail in participants' own practices. We reflect on the contexts that motivate subtle and detailed digital lutherie, and discuss the implications for DMI design researchers and technologists for studying and supporting this aspect of DMI design and craft practice in future.}

  abstract = {Diverse intelligence is an emerging field that views intelligence as a spectrum, drawing insights from e.g. cell-based models and their evolution, and recognising the combined agential properties of biological and engineered materials across disciplines. Within diverse intelligence, basal cognition encapsulates the simpler end of the continuum, focusing on broadly applicable insights from the behaviour of single-celled organisms and simulation. Based on a desire for more diversity of real-time AI in NIME, we developed a library called T\"olvera, initially for composable artificial life. In this paper we present T\"olvera's design and the practice-based methodology that drove it, reviewing artistic works and emergent themes from design-practice iteration cycles. We reflect on how an early influence of artificial life gave way to an interest in reading T\"olvera as a basal art medium, and how unexpected tendencies and capabilities play in perturbative aesthetic tension with compositional decisions. We describe how basal agency research, aesthetics and toolkits are influencing the direction of both design and practice, and review work-in-progress features. Finally, we reflect on how a cell's eye view of agency is shaping our thinking towards AI in NIME.}

  abstract = {This paper presents the Feedback Mop Cello, a feedback instrument integrating acoustic feedback loops generated through a microphone and loudspeaker combination with a control interface inspired by the cello. Current paradigms of interaction with feedback instruments are based around ideas of negotiation with autonomous systems rather than control. We explore the possibility of integration of negotiated and controlled elements through a design focused on isolating the acoustic feedback loop signal path from the signal path to which sound processing is applied. We focus on three musical parameters of timbre, pitch, and dynamics. We present timbre as a parameter to mainly be negotiated within the feedback loop, while pitch and dynamics are parameters that can be explicitly controlled through the interface. An approach is taken to minimize components within the feedback loop in order to foreground the choice of loudspeaker as an integral part of the instrument's sound. A preliminary user study is carried out involving five semi-professional musicians, focusing on their reflection regarding their interaction with the acoustic feedback loop.}

Given the prevalence of sensory over-responsivity (SOR) and under-responsivity (SUR) in ASD, traditional sensory interventions often fail to accommodate the highly individualized and fluctuating sensory needs of autistic individuals. The authors highlight the potential for multisensory NIME to address the diverse range of sensory needs, promoting emotional regulation and sensory balance through new creative musical opportunities and activities. This paper presents research in the form of a narrative review and comparative case study of recent NIME and sensory intervention research, exploring emerging approaches, rhythm-based interventions, generative algorithms, play-centered designs and other possibilities for enhancing sensory engagement and emotional regulation. Drawing on insights from 30 recent NIME papers, this research explores the boundaries of current approaches and seeks to establish an understanding of multisensory NIME for ASD. The research underscores the profound variability in sensory profiles for ASD, necessitating a shift from clinician-directed interventions to creative, inclusive, multisensory solutions. Finally, a set of sensory NIME design principles are offered, emphasizing the importance of sensory perception, sensory equilibrium and the promotion of emotional regulation for ASD.}

In particular, mobile cameras can provide rich input as they can capture a wide variety of user gestures or environment dynamics.

In this paper, we propose to combine motion/gesture input with the touch input, in order to filter movement information both temporally and spatially, thus increasing expressiveness while reducing computation time. We present a design space which demonstrates the diversity of interactions that our technique enables. We also report the results of a user study in which we observe how musicians appropriate the interaction space with an example instrument.},

We present a brief history at the intersection of VR and the laptop orchestra. We then present the design of the piece and distill it into a set of design principles. Broadly, these design principles address the interplay between the different conflicting perspectives at play: those of the VR performer, the ensemble, and the audience. For example, one principle suggests that the perceptual link between the physical and virtual world maybe enhanced for the audience by improving the performers' sense of embodiment. We argue that these design principles are a form of generalized knowledge about how we might design laptop orchestra pieces involving virtual reality.}

Inspired by the original design which used six metal contacts as inputs, I have used conductive paint to paint six pads on a ceramic skull which interact with the Kraakdoos circuit (using a uA709 IC). The skull depicts a sugar skull which is a traditional Mexican sweet that is often seen in altars to honour diseased relatives and loved ones during the Day of the Dead, but that is also consumed as a treat by children during these festivities. In this case, I have constructed an altar for Waisvisz, which doubles as an instrument, where the sugar skull---the centrepiece of the altar (below a picture of Waisvisz) serves both as traditional decoration but also the main point of contact with the instrument. Hence, the altar invites the musician to pay their respects by playing the instrument through the sugar skull. The Kraakavera also features a second mode which can be accessed by patching the skull's inputs to another circuit which features a Trill Craft capacitive sensing board and a Bela board, which processes a secondary sound output consisting of a sample of a ceramic whistle running through a granular synthesizer patched in Pure Data (corresponding to the six pads on the skull). Lastly, the Kraakavera presents a syncretism of Mexican folklore and circuit bending traditions and a juxtaposition of classic and upcoming DMIs.}

Specifically, this framework discusses the team's approach in combining techniques from situated computing, theatrical sound design practice and dynamical systems in order to create a new kind of adaptive audio scenographic environment augmented by wireless, distributed sensing for use in live theatrical performance. The goal of this adaptive sound design is to move beyond both existing playback models used in theatre sound as well as the purely humancentered, controller-instrument approach used in much current interactive performance practice.},

  abstract = {An entertainment environment to enrich music listening experience is purposed. This environment is composed of 3 modules: a MIDI player, a music animation and a haptic module that translates the notes played by one instrument into a resemblant vibration. To create the haptic vibration, the notes' relative pitch in the song are calculated, then these positions are mapped into the haptic signals' amplitude and frequency. Also, the envelope of the haptic signal is modified, by using an ADSR filter, to have the same envelope as the audio signal. To evaluate the perceived cross-modal similarity between users, two experiments were performed. In both, the users used the complete entertainment environment to rank the similarity between 3 different haptic signals, with triangular, square and analogue envelopes and 4 different instruments in a classical song. The first experiment was performed with the purposed amplitude and frequency technique, while the second experiment was performed with constant frequency and amplitude. Results, show different envelope user preferences. The square and triangular envelopes were preferred in the first experiment, while only analogue envelopes were preferred in the second. This suggests that the users' envelope perception was masked by the changes in amplitude and frequency.},

In both cases, the design process is not focused on creating DMIs for a community with a particular culture --- with established instruments, repertoire and playing styles --- outside European and North American traditions. This challenge motivated our research. In this paper, we discuss lessons learned during an one-year project called Batebit.

  abstract = {Play and playfulness compose an essential part of our lives as human beings. From childhood to adultness, playfulness is often associated with remarkable positive experiences related to fun, pleasure, intimate social activities, imagination, and creativity. Perhaps not surprisingly, playfulness has been recurrently used in NIME designs as a strategy to engage people, often non-expert, in short term musical activities. Yet, designing for playfulness remains a challenging task, as little knowledge is available for designers to support their decisions. To address this issue, we follow a design rationale approach using the context of Live Looping (LL) as a case study. We start by surveying 101 LL tools, summarizing our analysis into a new design space. We then use this design space to discuss potential guidelines to address playfulness in a design process. These guidelines are implemented and discussed in a new LL tool\&\#8212;called the "Voice Reaping Machine". Finally, we contrast our guidelines with previous works in the literature.}

With the advent of Internet communication, geographical displacement amongst the participants of a computer mediated music performance achieved world wide extension. However, when established over long distance networks, this form of musical communication has a fundamental problem: network latency (or net-delay) is an impediment for real-time collaboration. From a recent study, carried out by the authors, a relation between network latency tolerance and Music Tempo was established. This result emerged from an experiment, in which simulated network latency conditions were applied to the performance of different musicians playing jazz standard tunes. The Public Sound Objects (PSOs) project is web-based shared musical space, which has been an experimental framework to implement and test different approaches for on-line music communication. This paper describe features implemented in the latest version of the PSOs system, including the notion of a network-music instrument incorporating latency as a software function, by dynamically adapting its tempo to the communication delay measured in real-time.},

The Review was conducted with demonstrations by groups of students supervised by different Lecturer, in each case focusing on a different strategy to create a connection between Sound, Music, Acoustics, Space and Architectural Design. There was an assumption that the core working process would have to include the design of a new musical instrument, which in some cases became the final deliverable of the Studio and in other cases a step in a process that leads to a different outcome (such as an architectural Design, a performance or social experiment). One other relevant aspect was that Digital technology was used in the design and fabrication of the physical instruments' prototypes, but in very few cases, it was used in the actual generation or enhancement of sound, with the instruments relying almost exclusively in acoustic and mechanical sound.}

For each publication that explicitly mentioned the term evaluation, we looked for: a) What targets and stakeholders were considered? b) What goals were set? c) What criteria were used? d) What methods were used? e) How long did the evaluation last? Results show different understandings of evaluation, with little consistency regarding the usage of the word. Surprisingly in some cases, not even basic information such as goal, criteria and methods were provided. In this paper, we attempt to provide an idea of what evaluation means for the NIME community, pushing the discussion towards how could we make a better use of evaluation on NIME design and what criteria should be used regarding each goal.}

Although such orchestras remain common within UK institutions as well as in France, they are in decline in the rest of the world. In contrast, permanent, high-density loudspeaker arrays are on the rise, as is the practical application of 3-D audio technologies. Looking to the future, we need to reconcile the performance of historical and new stereo works, side-by-side native 3-D compositions. In anticipation of this growing need, we have designed and tested a prototype `Virtualmonium'. The Virtualmonium is an instrument for classical diffusion performance over an acousmonium emulated in higher-order Ambisonics. It allows composers to custom-design loudspeaker orchestra emulations for the performance of their works, rehearse and refine performances off-site, and perform classical repertoire alongside native 3-D formats in the same concert. This paper describes the technical design of the Virtualmonium, assesses the success of the prototype in some preliminary listening tests and concerts, and speculates how the instrument can further composition and performance practice.},

  abstract = {Cycle is a software tool for musical composition and improvisation that represents events along a circular timeline. In doing so, it breaks from the linear representational conventions of European Art music and modern Digital Audio Workstations. A user specifies time points on different layers, each of which corresponds to a particular sound. The layers are superimposed on a single circle, which allows a unique visual perspective on the relationships between musical voices given their geometric positions. Positions in-between quantizations are possible, which encourages experimentation with expressive timing and machine rhythms. User-selected transformations affect groups of notes, layers, and the pattern as a whole. Past and future states are also represented, synthesizing linear and cyclical notions of time. This paper will contemplate philosophical questions raised by circular rhythmic notation and will reflect on the ways in which the representational novelties and editing functions of Cycle have inspired creativity in musical composition.}

The author invokes the theoretical framework of Karen Barad to juxtapose the Urban Acupuncture movement with the Solarpunk ethos, arguing that sound installations may be crafted as agential cuts to the entangled relationship of humans and their built environments. This paper surveys sound artists that have specifically engaged the urban space---an environment that one could argue is more ``natural'' to humans than the remote picturesque landscapes commonly associated with the concept. Finally, the author describes some of his past sonic interventions and expounds on his current project, ``Standing Wave,'' commissioned by the city government and non-profits to address Extreme Urban Heat. He discusses how this installation, coupled with targeted community engagement through ``Environmental Listening'' workshops, urges us to rethink the temporality of intervention, recognizing that long-term strategies, while not immediate solutions, are crucial for future cooling and remediating the effects of climate change.}

Eye tracking data was also recorded from participants who saw the visuals, to reveal aspects of the performance that influenced their tension judgments. We analysed the data to explore how auditory and visual components and the performer's movements contribute to spectators' experience of tension. Our results show that their perception of emotional intensity is consistent across hearing and sight, suggesting that gestures in live-sequencing can be a medium for expressive performance.},

  abstract = {Most instruments traditionally used to teach music in early education, like xylophones or flutes, encumber children with the additional difficulty of an unfamiliar and unnatural interface. The most simple expressive interaction, that even the smallest children use in order to make music, is pounding at surfaces. Through the design of an instrument with a simple interface, like a drum, but which produces a melodic sound, children can be provided with an easy and intuitive means to produce consonance. This should then be further complemented with information from analysis and interpretation of childlike gestures and dance moves, reflecting their natural understanding of musical structure and motion. Based on these assumptions we propose a modular and reactive system for dynamic composition with accessible interfaces, divided into distinct plugins usable in a standard digital audio workstation. This paper describes our concept and how it can facilitate access to collaborative music making for small children. A first prototypical implementation has been designed and developed during the ongoing research project Drum-Dance-Music-Machine (DDMM), a cooperation with the local social welfare association AWO Hagen and the chair of musical education at the University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld.},

This paper discusses the notion of interface in public (especially outdoor) installation, starting with the authors' Sculpture by the Sea Windtraces work using this recent experience as the launch-pad, with reference to ways in which others have approached it (focusing on sensor, weather-activated outdoor installations in a brief traverse of related cases, e.g. works by Garth Paine, James Bulley and Daniel Jones, and David Bowen). This is a dialogical paper on the topic of interface and `site' as the aetiology of interaction/interface/instrument and its type of response (e.g. to environment and audience). While the focus here is on outdoor factors (particularly the climatic environment), indoor site-specific installation also experiences the effects of ambient noise, acoustic context, and audience as integral agents in the interface and perception of the work, its musical expression. The way in which features of the situation are integrated has relevance for others in the NIME community in the design of responsive spaces, art installation, and large-scale or installed instruments in which users, participants, acoustics play a significant role.},

Today, however, there is a lack of improvisation culture in classical music performance and education; classical musicians either are not trained to improvise, or cannot find other people to improvise with. Motivated by this observation, we develop BachDuet, a system that enables real-time counterpoint improvisation between a human anda machine. This system uses a recurrent neural network toprocess the human musician's monophonic performance ona MIDI keyboard and generates the machine's monophonic performance in real time. We develop a GUI to visualize the generated music content and to facilitate this interaction. We conduct user studies with 13 musically trained users and show the feasibility of two-party duet counterpoint improvisation and the effectiveness of BachDuet for this purpose. We also conduct listening tests with 48 participants and show that they cannot tell the difference between duets generated by human-machine improvisation using BachDuet and those generated by human-human improvisation. Objective evaluation is also conducted to assess the degree to which these improvisations adhere to common rules of counterpoint, showing promising results.}

MusicMapper is a web application that allows nonexpert users to find and visualize distinctive samples from a song without any manual intervention, and enables remixing by having users play back clusterings of such samples. This is accomplished by splitting audio from the Soundcloud API into appropriately-sized spectrograms, and applying the t-SNE algorithm to visualize these spectrograms in two dimensions. Next, we apply k-means to guide the user's eye toward related clusters and set k=26 to enable playback of the clusters by pressing keys on an ordinary keyboard. We present the source code (https://github.com/fatsmcgee/MusicMappr) and a demo video (http://youtu.be/mvD6e1uiO8k) of the MusicMapper web application that can be run in most modern browsers.}

Neurythmic is the first such system to use CPGs for interactive rhythm creation. We discuss how Neurythmic uses the entrainment behaviour of these networks to support the creation of rhythms while avoiding the rigidity of grid quantisation approaches. As well as discussing the development, design and evaluation of Neurythmic, we discuss relevant properties of the CPG networks used (Matsuoka's Neural Oscillator), and describe methods for their control. Evaluation with expert and professional musicians shows that Neurythmic is a versatile tool, adapting well to a range of quite different musical approaches.},

This system also supports the performance of acousmatic and electronic music, enabling performances where the traditionally central mixing board, need not be touched at all (or minimally touched for calibration).

Positions can be read from the haptic device, and forces can be written to the device using messages in Pd. Various additional objects have been created to facilitate rapid prototyping of useful haptic musical instruments in Pd. HSP operates under Linux, OS X, and Windows and supports the mass-produced Falcon haptic device from NovInt, which can currently be obtained for as little as US\$150. All of the above make HSP an especially excellent choice for pedagogical environments where multiple workstations are required and example programs should be complete yet simple.},

Through a mixed method approach applying both written and oral response, feedback from one blindfolded and one seeing audience group was collected and analyzed. There were marked differences between the groups regarding focus, in that the participants in blindfolded group tended to focus on fewer aspects, have a heightened focus and be less distracted than the seeing group. The seeing group, on its part, focused more on the technological instruments applied in the performance, the performer herself and her actions. This study also shows that there were only minor differences between the groups regarding the experience of skill and control, and argues that this observation can be explained by earlier research on skill in NIMEs.},

If the improviser in turn reacts to these answers, a musical loop between the human and the machine can emerge. The way input and reaction correlate and the predictability of Tango's responses can be defined by the user via a setup of improvising environments, called Rooms. Real-time sampling with knowledge of the musical content behind the samples and Midi-handling are unified via Tango's own monophonic audio-to-Midi, time stretching and pitch shifting algorithms. Both audio and Midi can be used by Tango's modules (e.g. Listeners, Players, Modifiers, Metronomes or Harmony) for input and output. A flexible real time control system allows for internal and external remote control and scaling of most parameters. The free software for Windows7 with all necessary folders, English and German manuals, many example-Rooms and a few videos can be downloaded at www.henning-berg.de.},

Multiple perceptually-guided viewpoints from rhythmic, harmonic, timbral and dynamic attributes define a discrete and finite alphabet with minimal formal and subjective assumptions using unsupervised and user-guided methods.

With the fretting hand, guitarists can switch between two effect loops, depending on the hand's fret position that is measured by a distance sensor on the guitar's headstock. The posture of the picking/strumming hand is captured by an IMU sensor on a hand strap, in order to control guitar effects pedals that have an expression input. The Dextoria system is modular and embeds into guitarists' existing live setups.}

  abstract = {Advanced musical cooperation, such as concurrent control of musical parameters or sharing data between instruments,has previously been investigated using multi-user instruments or orchestras of identical instruments. In the case of heterogeneous digital orchestras, where the instruments, interfaces, and control gestures can be very different, a number of issues may impede such collaboration opportunities. These include the lack of a standard method for sharing data or control, the incompatibility of parameter types, and limited awareness of other musicians' activity and instrument structure. As a result, most collaborations remain limited to synchronising tempo or applying effects to audio outputs. In this paper we present two interfaces for real-time group collaboration amongst musicians with heterogeneous instruments. We conducted a qualitative study to investigate how these interfaces impact musicians' experience and their musical output, we performed a thematic analysis of inter-views, and we analysed logs of interactions. From these results we derive principles and guidelines for the design of advanced collaboration systems for heterogeneous digital orchestras, namely Adapting (to) the System, Support Development, Default to Openness, and Minimise Friction to Support Expressivity.}

However, in the context of spontaneous and heterogeneous orchestras, such as jam sessions, collective music-making may become challenging due to the diversity and complexity of the DMIs and the musicians' unfamiliarity with the others' instruments. In particular, the potential lack of visibility into each musician's respective contribution to the sound they hear, i.e. who is playing what, might impede their capacity to play together. In this paper, we propose to augment each instrument in a digital orchestra with visual feedback extracted in real-time from the instrument's activity, in order to increase this awareness. We present the results of a user study in which we investigate the influence of visualisation level and situational visibility during short improvisations by groups of three musicians. Our results suggest that internal visualisations of all instruments displayed close to each musician's instrument provide the best awareness.}

  abstract = {Liveness is a well-known problem with Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs). When used in performances, DMIs provide less visual information than acoustic instruments, preventing the audience from understanding how the musicians influence the music. In this paper, we look at this issue through the lens of causality. More specifically, we investigate the attribution of causality by an external observer to a performer, relying on the theory of apparent mental causation. We suggest that the perceived causality between a performer's gestures and the musical result is central to liveness. We present a framework for assessing attributed causality and agency to a performer, based on a psychological theory which suggests three criteria for inferred causality. These criteria then provide the basis of an experimental study investigating the effect of visual augmentations on audience's inferred causality. The results provide insights on how the visual component of performances with DMIs impacts the audience's causal inferences about the performer. In particular we show that visual augmentations help highlight the influence of the musician when parts of the music are automated, and help clarify complex mappings between gestures and sounds. Finally we discuss the potential wider implications for assessing liveness in the design of new musical interfaces.}

In this paper, we describe the approach and implementation challenges of Reflets. We then demonstrate that it matches the requirements of musical performances. It allows for placing virtual content anywhere on large stages, even overlapping with physical elements and provides a consistent rendering of this content for large numbers of spectators. It also preserves non-verbal communication between the audience and the performers, and is inherently engaging for the spectators. We finally show that Reflets opens musical performance opportunities such as augmented interaction between musicians and novel techniques for 3D sound shapes manipulation.}

This problem becomes especially true when the implemented mappings between gesture and music are subtle or complex. These instruments may also restrict the appropriation possibilities of controls, by comparison to physical interfaces. Most existing solutions to these issues are based on distant and/or limited visual feedback (LEDs, small screens). Our approach is to augment the gestures themselves with revealed virtual objects. Our contributions are, first a novel approach of visual feedback that allow for additional expressiveness, second a software pipeline for pixel-level feedback and control that ensures tight coupling between sound and visuals, and third, a design space for extending gestural control using revealed interfaces. We also demonstrate and evaluate our approach with the augmentation of three existing gestural musical instruments.}

  abstract = {This paper describes a machine learning approach in the context of non-idiomatic human-machine improvisation. In an attempt to avoid explicit mapping of user actions to machine responses, an experimental machine learning strategy is suggested where rewards are derived from the implied motivation of the human interactor -- two motivations are at work: integration (aiming to connect with machine generated material) and expression (independent activity). By tracking consecutive changes in musical distance (i.e. melodic similarity) between human and machine, such motivations can be inferred. A variation of Q-learning is used featuring a self-optimizing variable length state-action-reward list. The system (called Pock) is tunable into particular behavioral niches by means of a limited number of parameters. Pock is designed as a recursive structure and behaves as a complex dynamical system. When tracking systems variables over time, emergent non-trivial patterns reveal experimental evidence of attractors demonstrating successful adaptation.},

While auditory or haptic biofeedback may be used in these cases, the additional sensory channels can increase workload or act as a nuisance to the user. A number of studies, however, have shown that music can improve mood and concentration, while also reduce aggression and boredom. Here, we propose an intervention that combines the benefits of biofeedback and music to help users regulate their stress response while performing a visual task (driving a car simulator). Our approach encourages slow breathing by adjusting the quality of the music in response to the user's breathing rate. We evaluate the intervention on a 2\textbackslash times2 design with music and auditory biofeedback as independent variables. Our results indicate that our music-biofeedback intervention leads to lower arousal (reduced electrodermal activity and increased heart rate variability) than music alone, auditory biofeedback alone and a control condition.}

Within artistic practice, this reconceptualisation has led to a medium that emphasises this multisensory integration of virtual processes, leading to expressive, narrative-driven, and thought-provoking AR experiences. This paper outlines the development and evaluation of the polaris experience. polaris is built using a set of open-source hardware and software components that can be used to create privacy-respecting and cost-effective audiovisual AR experiences. Its wearable component is comprised of the open-source Project North Star AR headset and a pair of bone conduction headphones, providing simultaneous real and virtual visual and auditory elements. These elements are spatially aligned using Unity and PureData to the real space that they appear in and can be gesturally interacted with in a way that fosters artistic and musical expression. In order to evaluate the polaris , 10 participants were recruited, who spent approximately 30 minutes each in the AR scene and were interviewed about their experience. Using grounded theory, the author extracted coded remarks from the transcriptions of these studies, that were then sorted into the categories of Sentiment, Learning, Adoption, Expression, and Immersion. In evaluating polaris it was found that the experience engaged participants fruitfully, with many noting their ability to express themselves audiovisually in creative ways. The experience and the framework the author used to create it is available in a Github respository.}

Though there is motivation to address these problems, there is an open question of how to meaningfully do so. This paper proposes that NIME's historical record is the best tool for understanding our own output but this record is incomplete, and makes the case for collective action to improve how we document our work. I begin by contrasting NIME's output with its discourse, and explore the nature of this discourse through NIME history and examine our inherited epistemological complexity. I assert that, if left unexamined, this complexity can undermine our community values of diversity and inclusion. I argue that meaningfully addressing current problems demands critical reflection on our work, and explore how NIME's historical record is currently used as a means of doing so. I then review what NIME's historical record contains (and what it does not), and evaluate its fitness for use as a tool of inquiry. Finally I make the case for collective action to establish better documentation practices, and suggest features that may be helpful for the process as well as the result.}

Disfluency, defined as a barrier to effortless cognitive processing, has been shown to generate better results in some contexts as it engages higher levels of cognition. We were motivated to determine if disfluent design in a DMI would result in a risk state that audiences would be able to perceive, and if this would have any effect on their evaluation of the performance. A DMI was produced that incorporated a disfluent characteristic: It would turn itself off if not constantly moved. Six physically identical instruments were produced, each in one of three versions: Control (no disfluent characteristics), mild disfluency (turned itself off slowly), and heightened disfluency (turned itself off more quickly). 6 percussionists each performed on one instrument for a live audience (N=31), and data was collected in the form of real-time feedback (via a mobile phone app), and post-hoc surveys. Though there was little difference in ratings of enjoyment between the versions of the instrument, the real-time and qualitative data suggest that disfluent behaviour in a DMI may be a way for audiences to perceive and appreciate performer skill.},

We held a concert in which two DMI creator-performers each played two pieces in differing styles. Before the concert, each half the 64-person audience was given a technical explanation of one of the instruments. Results showed that receiving an explanation increased the reported understanding of that instrument, but had no effect on either the reported level of interest or enjoyment. On the other hand, performances in experimental versus conventional style on the same instrument received widely divergent audience responses. We discuss implications of these findings for DMI design.},

Music has always been a method through which alien cultures are made relatable to humans, and musical instruments become props through which we learn about an alien culture that is totally different to that of humans. These musical instruments were not designed with musical use in mind; rather they are designed as storytelling devices, and never intended to work or make sound. After discovering one of these instruments I realised that recreating it in the way it was imagined and making it functional would require consideration of the instrument's storytelling function above all else, including the technology. In this paper I describe the process of re-creating an instrument from Star Trek as a functional DMI, a process in which design decisions were guided by what the storytelling intentions were for this imagined instrument, and what I found out by having to make technical choices that supported them (not the other way around). As well as reporting the design and implementation process I summarise the important design lesson that came from having to emphasise the intended mood and presence of an instrument, instead of the design being steered by technical affordances.}

As audio has an inherently a linear, time-based structure, these have generally followed logical layouts such as tape, or grooved records and cylinders. This project explores magnetic recording technology and digital analogues for recording and playback that are instead on spherical topology. This instrument expands the concept of the audio loop through a more tangible and randomized approach than traditional record playback techniques of tape, while maintaining a familiarity with historic techniques of audio looping and scrubbing. Through it, one can not only create linear time-loops but blends between different times of the recording non-sequentially. The size and mass of the spheres enhances the performative elements through the physics of inertia. The movement possibilities allow for non-linear circles, circuits, spirals and other patterns of sound not traditionally possible through linear tape or digital loop, including accelerations and decelerations -- akin to a turntable, but with greater freedom of direction, thus offering surreal record/playback possibilities.}

The AI Harmonizer introduces a novel approach by autonomously generating musically coherent four-part harmonies without requiring prior harmonic input from the user. By integrating state-of-the-art generative AI techniques for pitch detection and voice modeling with custom-trained symbolic music models, our system arranges any vocal melody into rich choral textures. In this paper, we present our methods, explore potential applications in performance and composition, and discuss future directions for real-time implementations.

The paper then reviews existing principles and frameworks for designing digital musical instruments (DMIs.) The reviews of literature and current frameworks are then used to inform a set of design considerations for instruments for users with complex needs, and in SEN settings. 18 design considerations are presented with connections to literature and practice. An implementation example including future work is presented, and finally a conclusion is then offered.}

The body of the instrument emerged from material-led making, and the disparate elements of a particular musical performance ecology (acoustic instrument, audio effects, samples, synthesis and controls) are juxtaposed and unified into one coherent whole. As such, Kalimbo demonstrates how visual arts, in particular collage, can inform the design and creation of new musical instruments, interfaces and streamlined performance ecologies.}

Each of these instruments is a five-voice granular synthesizer which processes a different sound source to give each a unique timbre and range. The performer interacts with these voices individually with five joysticks positioned to lay under the performer's fingertips. The JoyStyx uses a custom-designed printed circuit board. This board provides the joystick layout and connects them to an Arduino Micro, which serializes the ten analog X/Y position values and the five digital button presses. This data controls the granular and spatial parameters of a Pure Data patch running on a Raspberry Pi 2. The nature of the JoyStyx construction causes the frequency response to be coloured by the materials and their geometry, leading to a unique timbre. This endows the instrument with a more ``analog'' or ``natural'' sound, despite relying on computer-based algorithms. In concert, the quartet performance with the JoyStyx may potentially be the first performance ever with a quartet of Embedded Acoustic Instruments.}

The MM holds the potential to redefine areas such as musical composition and performance via immersive environments based on technologically mediated social interactions. Despite substantial research on single-user immersive systems, the intersection of NIME and the MM remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically explore this domain by examining previous and current approaches, alongside conducting interviews with eleven experts who have created multi-user immersive musical environments and authored publications on this topic. The goal is to map such an uncharted territory by collecting valuable insights and leveraging the perspective of experts to provide an understanding of the potentials and challenges inherent in creating immersive social environments for musical activities. Our results reveal that existing multi-user immersive environments make use of diverse implementation approaches but face challenges due to the absence of standardized technology stacks, particularly in networking and data synchronization.}

With this work, we start a systematic exploration of this relatively uncharted research area, by means of (1) briefly reviewing existing musical interfaces that capitalize on deformable input,and (2) surveying 11 among experts and pioneers in the field about their experience with and vision on non-rigid musical interfaces.Based on experts' input, we suggest possible next steps of musical appropriation with deformable and shape-changing technologies.We conclude by discussing how cross-overs between NIME and HCI research will benefit non-rigid interfaces.}

This study aims to explore the needs of electroacoustic composers and musicians in a Metaverse dedicated to musical activities. For this, we conducted a half-day workshop with fourteen participants to collect data. Eleven user needs and potential issues were identified and discussed. The reported findings may contribute to enhance the understanding of the user experience in the MM by considering the needs and requirements expressed by specific stakeholders and early adopters, such as electroacoustic practitioners.}

The extra layer of social-physical interaction both constrains and inspires the participant-artist relation and the sonic exploration, and through this, his body is transformed into an instrument, and physical space is transformed into a sound-space. The project aims to explore the experience of interaction between human and technology and its impact on one's bodily perception and embodiment, as well as the relation between body and space, departing from a set of existing theories on embodiment. In the paper, its underlying aesthetics are described and discussed, as well as the sensitive motion research process behind it, and the technical implementation of the work.

The system is trained using sheet music and associated performances, in particular using notated performance directions and user-system interaction data to ground performance directions in performances. Users can listen to an autonomously generated performance or actively engage in the performance process. A speech- and gesture-based feedback loop and online learning from past user interactions improve the accuracy of the performance rendering control. There are two important assumptions behind our approach: a) that many people can express nuanced aspects of expressive performance using natural human expressive faculties, such as speech, voice, and gesture, and b) that by doing so and hearing the music follow their direction with low latency, they can enjoy playing the music that would otherwise be inaccessible to them. The ultimate goal of this work is to enable fulfilling and accessible music making experiences for a large number of people who are not currently musically active.}

At present, this kind of interfaces present at least some of the following charac-teristics that limit their musical use: latency in the inter-action, and partial or complete lack of responsiveness to gestures such as tapping, scrubbing or pressing force. Our current research is exploring ways of improving the quality of interaction with this kind of interfaces, and in particular with the tangible tabletop instrument Reactable . In this paper we present a system based on a circular array of me-chanically intercoupled force sensing resistors used to obtain a low-latency, affordable, and easily embeddable hardware system able to detect surface impacts and pressures on the tabletop perimeter. We also consider the option of com-pleting this detected gestural information with the sound information coming from a contact microphone attached to the mechanical coupling layer, to control physical modelling synthesis of percussion instruments.},

As we describe here, SATIE is designed for improved scalability: minimum dependency between nodes in the audio DSP graph for parallel audio computation, controlling sound objects by groups and load balancing computation of geometry that allow to reduce the number of messages for controlling simultaneously a high number of sound sources. The paper presents SATIE along with example use case scenarios. Our initial work demonstrates SATIE's flexibility, and has provided us with novel sonic sensations such as ``audio depth of field'' and real-time sound swarming.}

Within NIME, several projects exist seeking to make these techniques useful in real-time music making. However, we debate whether the functionally-oriented approaches inherited from engineering domains that much machine listening research manifests is fully suited to the exploratory, divergent, boundary-stretching, uncertainty-seeking, playful and irreverent orientations of many artists. To explore this, we engaged in a concerted collaborative design exercise in which many different listening algorithms were implemented and presented with input which challenged their customary range of application and the implicit norms of musicality which research can take for granted. An immersive 3D spatialised multichannel environment was created in which the algorithms could be explored in a hybrid installation/performance/lecture form of research presentation. The paper closes with reflections on the creative value of `hijacking' formal approaches into deviant contexts, the typically undocumented practical know-how required to make algorithms work, the productivity of a playfully irreverent relationship between engineering and artistic approaches to NIME, and a sketch of a sonocybernetic aesthetics for our work.},

The design emerged from an artistic research process which emphasises multiple explorations coexisting around a research topic while having a sensitivity to the practicalities of a customary gig (short set-up time, unpredictable acoustics). Typically enabled by a stereo room-mic and a pair of speakers, many algorithms have been explored in the loop with some being tributes to historical feedback works. An overall design is offered where all feedback pathways are simultaneously available and mutually interfere via the room. Each algorithm is designed to have one significant performable parameter but how this is mapped to sensors or widgets is itself performable with various behaviours available, including some explorations of self-programming and `intra-active' ideas. Concert experience in solo and small ensemble formats is discussed and a number of contributions are identified in how the work: extends room feedback research to explore multiple parallel processes of varied spectro-morphological character, offers connections to historical work in a pedagogically interesting fashion, demonstrates several novel algorithms, while exemplifying a characteristic artistic research method. The paper closes with a speculative `feedback aesthetics' to help configure future work.}

We lay out a conceptual framework for the exploration of hybrid resonant assemblages and describe how we have approached implementing them. Our performance experience is presented and implications for work are discussed. In the light of our work, we urge a reconsideration of the implicit norms of performance which underlie much research in NIME.

We explored an orientation to making which promoted the creation of a family of instruments and performance environments that were responses to the self-consciously provocative theme of `One Knob To Rule Them All'. A variety of design issues were explored including: mapping, physicality, the question of control in interface design, reductionist aesthetics and design strategies, and questions of gender and power in musical culture. We discuss not only the technologies which were made but also reflect on the value of such concerted, provocatively thematised, collective making activities for addressing foundational design issues.

Yet motionless laptop performers endure as musical spectacles from clubs to concert halls, suggesting that for many this is a non-issue. Understanding these perceptions might help performers better achieve their intentions, inform interface design within the NIME field and help develop theories of liveness and performance. To this end, a study of listeners' perception of liveness and performer control in laptop performance was carried out, in which listeners examined several short audio-only excerpts of laptop performances and answered questions about their perception of the performance: what they thought was happening and its sense of liveness. Our results suggest that audiences are likely to associate liveness with perceived performer activity such as improvisation and the audibility of gestures, whereas perceptions of generative material, backing tracks, or other preconceived material do not appear to inhibit perceptions of liveness.}

We present two creative case studies using the system: the creation of a dance performance and the creation of a distributed musical installation.

The different tone generators turn the saxophone into a flute, a sarrusophone, a modern variation of the Renaissance cornett, and a free-reed instrument with each instrument class's distinct sonic characters. The foot-controller system consists of a trackball operated by the big toe of one foot with separate pedals to simulate the mouse buttons with the other foot. The system also includes a traditional MIDI bass pedal, an expression pedal, and a wide-spaced ASCII keyboard. In particular, the trackball system enables complex timbre changes and a flexible processing flow needed for freely improvised music. It can be used to control a complete personal computer. The learning curve to develop the feet's fine motor skills is comparable to learning new embouchures for the different tone generators.}

It does not provide a theoreticalframework within which we can analyze different scheduling protocols and theirimpact on the DMI's performance. Indeed, the mapping between the DMI's sensoryinputs and sonic outputs is classically treated as a black box. DMI designersand builders are forced to design and schedule the flow of data through thisblack box on their own. Improper design of the data flow can produceundesirable results, ranging from overflowing buffers that cause system crashesto misaligned sensory data that result in strange or disordered sonic events.In this paper, we attempt to remedy this problem by providing a framework forthe design and analysis of the DMI data flow. We also provide a schedulingalgorithm built upon that framework that guarantees desirable properties forthe resulting DMI.},

Digital sound generation is typically controlled by a large number of parameters and efficient and flexible mapping is necessary to provide expressive control over the instrument. The proposed modulation matrix technique may be seen as a generic and selfmodifying mapping mechanism integrated in a dynamic interpolation scheme. It is implemented efficiently by taking advantage of its inherent sparse matrix structure. The modulation matrix is used within the Hadron Particle Synthesizer, a complex granular module with 200 synthesis parameters and a simplified performance control structure with 4 expression parameters.},

  abstract = {This paper explores working methods and instrument design for musical performance sessions (studio and live) where cross-adaptive techniques for audio processing are utilized. Cross-adaptive processing uses feature extraction methods and digital processing to allow the actions of one acoustic instrument to influence the timbre of another. Even though the physical interface for the musician is the familiar acoustic instrument, the musical dimensions controlled with the actions on the instrument have been expanded radically. For this reason, and when used in live performance, the cross-adaptive methods constitute new interfaces for musical expression. Not only do the musician control his or her own instrumental expression, but the instrumental actions directly influence the timbre of another instrument in the ensemble, while their own instrument's sound is modified by the actions of other musicians. In the present paper we illustrate and discuss some design issues relating to the configuration and composition of such tools for different musical situations. Such configurations include among other things the mapping of modulators, the choice of applied effects and processing methods.},

We first describe the system, controlled by the performer's arms through Inertial Measuring Units and Electromyography sensors. The produced data is analyzed and used through mapping strategies as input of the sound synthesis engine. We conducted user studies to refine the sound synthesis engine, the choice of gestures and the mappings between them, and to finally evaluate this proof of concept. Indeed, the users approached the system with their own awareness ranging from the manipulation of abstract sound to the direct simulation of atmospheric phenomena - in the latter case, it could even be to revive memories or to create novel situations. This suggests that the approach of instrumentalization of sounds of known source may be a fruitful strategy for constructing expressive interactive sonic systems.}

The device is handmade from off-the-shelf components onto a specially designed PCB and laser cut wooden boards. Development versions of the device have been tested in wildlife listening contexts and in location-based ensemble performance. The device is simple to use, compact and inexpensive to facilitate use in community-based active listening workshops intended to enhance user's appreciation of the eco acoustic richness of natural environments.

The skull and nasal passages are fabricated based on Computed Topology (CT) scans of hadrosaur skulls, and larynx design is informed by scientific research. Musicians and participants voice the instruments by blowing into a mouthpiece or microphone, and a larynx mechanism creates the sound in response, which is then resonated through the nasal passages. The instruments are intended both for interactive exhibition and for on-going musical performance practice. Dinosaur Choir aims to give life to the voices of dinosaurs, allowing an embodied experience with extinct animals long lost to the past. This paper focuses on the development of the first musical instrument in the series, based on an adult Corythosaurus skull. We consider how scientific research as well as musical and practical concerns impact the design process and what trade-offs must be contemplated and made in order to achieve our aims of dinosaurian embodied sound.}

Our acoustic evaluation shows drum rolls executed by DRMMR easily exhibit greater levels of regularity, speed, and precision than comparable transducer and electromagnetic-based actuation methods. DRMMR's nonlinear acoustic synthesis functionality also presents possibilities for new kinds of sonic interactions on the surface of drum membranes.}

The primary objective of this research is to develop an instrument capable of producing a broad and diverse range of audio spectra that can be expressively articulated through responsive touch-based interaction. Integrating the synthesis process with gestural parameter mapping is crucial for the performative capabilities of New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIMEs). The technical development of an MSN-based instrument was subject to an iterative design process with mixed method evaluation. The usability and practical application of the MSN instrument was refined through performance experiences, which illustrate the effectiveness of the synthesis-gesture mappings in providing dynamic and expressive control over the diverse generated audio spectra.}

However, many music interaction evaluations remain informal. In this paper, we provide a meta-review of 132 papers from the 2014 -- 2016 proceedings of the NIME, SMC and ICMC conferences to collate the aspects of UX research that are already present in music interaction literature, and to highlight methods from UX's widening field of research that have not yet been explored. Our findings show that usability and aesthetics are the primary focus of evaluations in music interaction research, and other important components of the user experience such as enchantment, motivation and frustration are frequently if not always overlooked. We argue that these factors are prime areas for future research in the field and their consideration in design and evaluation could lead to a better understanding of NIMEs and other computer music technology.}

Differences were found in primary target user groups of digital platforms in the UK and China as well as the stages of the culture creation cycle they were developed for. Reasons for the divergence of digital platforms include differences in culture, regulation, and infrastructure, as well as the inherent Western bias of software for music making such as Digital Audio Workstations.

  abstract = {A novel method of digital scratching is presented as an alternative to currently available digital hardware interfaces and time-coded vinyl (TCV). Similar to TCV, the proposed method leverages existing analog turntables as a physical interface to manipulate the playback of digital audio. To doso, however, an accelerometer/gyroscope--equipped smartphone is firmly attached to a modified record, placed on a turntable, and used to sense a performers movement, resulting in a wireless sensing-based scratching method. The accelerometer and gyroscope data is wirelessly transmitted to a computer to manipulate the digital audio playback in real-time. The method provides the benefit of digital audio and storage, requires minimal additional hardware, accommodates familiar proprioceptive feedback, and allows a single interface to control both digital and analog audio. In addition, the proposed method provides numerous additional benefits including real-time graphical display,multi-touch interaction, and untethered performance (e.g``air-scratching''). Such a method turns a vinyl record into an interactive surface and enhances traditional scratching performance by affording new and creative musical interactions. Informal testing show this approach to be viable,responsive, and robust.},

In preparation for its deployment in a real-world performance setting the team conducted a user study aimed to define relevant constraints of the Google Glass display. Based on the observed data, a conductor part from an existing laptop orchestra piece was retrofitted, thereby replacing the laptop with a Google Glass running Glasstra and a similarly inconspicuous forearm-mounted Wiimote controller. Below we present findings from the user study that have informed the design of the visual display, as well as multi-perspective observations from a series of real-world performances, including the designer, user, and the audience. We use findings to offer a new hypothesis, an inverse uncanny valley or what we refer to as uncanny mountain pertaining to audience's potential distraction with the technology within the context of a live technology-mediated music performance as a function of minimizing on-stage technological footprint.}

As part of a preliminary study, the team designed modules targeting 4th and 5th grade students, the primary focus being exploration of creativity and collaborative learning. The resulting environment infrastructure -coupled with the Boys \& Girls Club of Southwest Virginia Satellite Linux Laptop Orchestra -offers opportunities for students to design and build original instruments, master them through a series of rehearsals, and ultimately utilize them as part of an ensemble in a performance of a predetermined piece whose parameters are coordinated by instructor through an embedded networked module. The ensuing model will serve for the assessment and development of a stronger connection with content-area standards and the development of creative thinking and collaboration skills.},

Motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, Tweeter's introduction in April 2020 has ensured uninterrupted operation of Virginia Tech's Linux Laptop Orchestra (L2Ork), resulting in 6 international performances over the past 18 months. In addition to enabling tightly-timed sync between clients, it also uniquely supports all stages of NIME-centric telematic musicking, from collaborative instrument design and instruction, to improvisation, composition, rehearsal, and performance, including audience participation. Tweeter is also envisioned as a prototype for the crowdsourced approach to telematic musicking. Below, the paper delves deeper into motivation, constraints, design and implementation, and the observed impact as an applied instance of a proposed paradigmshift in telematic musicking and its newfound identity fueled by the live crowdsourced telematic music genre.}

Leveraging its distinctive acoustic properties and electromechanical kinetics, the tufting gun presents a range of physical affordances that can be creatively repurposed for musical expression. While prior intersections between textile production processes and musical practices exist, the tufting gun remains largely underexplored as a tool for structured musical composition. This work reimagines the gun's mechanical gestures and performative affordances, transforming its utilitarian motions into expressive sonic gestures. By positioning the tufting gun as both an acoustic source and an interactive performance interface, this project works at the intersection of fibre craft and experimental sound art, where both historico-cultural context of textile making, and the ergonomics of the gun, present musical affordances.}

My intention is that the finalseries will guide a beginner from these initial steps through agraduated method, eventually incorporating some of the moreadvanced techniques regularly used by electronic musiccomposers.I describe the order of the series, and discuss the benefits (bothto performers and to composers) of having a logical sequence ofskill-based etudes.

  abstract = {This paper explores the design and use of a camera-based digital musical instrument as a thinking tool for considering entangled, post-human perspectives. The design of the pattern organ, inspired by experimental optical sound-on-film practices, employs a method of visual-to-audio synthesis that responds closely to the material behaviours captured by its camera input.Drawing on findings from exploratory workshops and short material experiments, we describe how interactions emerge and are shaped by both the physical configuration of the instrument and the material behaviours captured by its camera. We consider how frugal mappings and the `rawness' of data can give rise to instruments whose inputs remain open to material complexity, extending the sound engine beyond their enclosures.In the case of the pattern organ, this complexity emerges through overlapping and interfering interactions, where structural forms, human influence, light, shadows, lens distortions, and system quirks all contribute to the shifting harmonic content of the wavetable. We reflect on the instrument as a fluid assemblage, composed of human and non-human entanglements, encouraging us to think beyond traditional notions of human-centred control.}

All graphical elements representing the same parameter will have their value synchronized through the network mechanisms. Some practical considerations surrounding the implementation of this idea like automatic layout of control, editing interfaces on mobile touch-screen devices and auto-discovery of network nodes are discussed. Finally, GoOSC, a mobile application implementing these ideas is presented.}

In its current manifestation, control data is mapped to change the processing of the instrument's natural sound in Pd (Pure Data) [3]. SCUBA preserves the unity of the solo instrument interface by acoustically mixing direct and processed sound in the instrument's bell via mounted satellite speakers, which are driven by a subwoofer below the performer's chair.

As in the traditional artifact, the interaction of this new electronic yupana is based on the arrangement of seeds on a specially designed board with boxes, holes, and photoresistors. The shadow detected by the seeds' positioning sends real-time motion data in MIDI messages to Pure Data in a drum machine patch. As a result, percussion samples of Andean instruments fill pulses in a four-quarter beat, generating patterns that can be transformed live into different rhythms. This interface complements the Electronic\_Khipu\_ (a previous NIME based on an Andean khipu) by producing the rhythmic component. This experience unites ancestral and contemporary technologies in experimental sound performance following the theoretical-practical research on the vindication of the memory in ancestral Andean technological interfaces made invisible by colonization, reusing them from a decolonial perspective in NIMEs.},

  abstract = {In computer or electroacoustic music, it is often the case that the compositional act and the parametric control of the underlying synthesis algorithms or hardware are not separable from each other. In these situations, composition and control of the synthesis parameters are not easy to distinguish. One possible solution is by means of fuzzy logic. This approach provides a simple, intuitive but powerful control of the compositional process usually in interesting non-linear ways. Compositional control in this context is achieved by the fuzzification of the relevant internal synthesis parameters and the parallel computation of common sense fuzzy rules of inference specified by the composer. This approach has been implemented computationally as a software package entitled FLCTK (Fuzzy Logic Control Tool Kit) in the form of external objects for the widely used real-time compositional environments Max/MSP and Pd. In this article, we present an updated version of this tool. As a demonstration of the wide range of situations in which this approach could be used, we provide two examples of parametric fuzzy control: first, the fuzzy control of a water tank simulation and second a particle-based sound synthesis technique by a fuzzy approach.},

Specifically, we introduce a custom adapter for the Oculus Touch controller that allows it to be augmented with physical parts that can be tracked, visualized, and sonified in VR. This way, a VR instrument can be made to have a physical manifestation that facilitates additional forms of tactile feedback besides those offered by the Touch controller, enabling new forms of musical interaction. We then discuss a case study, where we use the adapter to implement a new VR instrument that integrates the repelling force between neodymium magnets into the controllers. This allows us to imbue the virtual instrument, which is inherently devoid of tactility, with haptic feedback----an essential affordance of many musical instruments.}

The Parallaxis platform places these texts within a networked, interactive environment with a generalised set of controls in order to explore and devise ontologies of network performance. As an interactive tool involved in music production the score system itself undergoes a functional transformation and becomes a distributed meta-instrument in its own right, independent from, yet intrinsically connected to those instruments held by the performers.}

The intention is not to reduce human physicality, but instead actions are further extended and altered through complex envelopes. This software was originally designed for the augmented guitar, to address the issue of a lack of spare bandwidth (Cook, 2001) that is inherent to guitar playing. This makes it challenging to simultaneously control digital interfaces without compromising guitar technique. The Slider MultiMap software discussed in this paper helps to overcome this dilemma by enabling a guitarist to control multiple audio effects with a single gesture while individually customising how each parameter is controlled prior to the performance. At the same time, it explores the delegation of tasks to the computer in situations where indirect control is more desirable.}

As physical and digital assemblages, interfaces also act as traces of the authoring entities that created them. Their intentions, likes, dislikes, and ultimate determinations of what is creatively useful all get embedded into the available choices of the interface. In this light, the self-perception of the musical HCI and instrument designer can be seen as occupying a primary importance in the instruments and interfaces that eventually come to be created. The work of a designer who self-identifies as an artist may result in a vastly different outcome than one who considers him or herself to be an entrepreneur, or a scientist, for example. These differing definitions of self as well as their HCI outcomes require their own means of critique, understanding and expectations. All too often, these definitions are unclear, or the considerations of overlapping means of critique remain unexamined.}

For the same reason however, they may hinder the audience experience, making the musician contribution and expressiveness difficult to perceive. In order to cope with this issue without altering the instruments, researchers and artists alike have designed techniques to augment their performances with additional information, through audio, haptic or visual modalities. These techniques have however only been designed to offer a fixed level of information, without taking into account the variety of spectators expertise and preferences. In this paper, we investigate the design, implementation and effect on audience experience of visual augmentations with controllable level of detail (LOD). We conduct a controlled experiment with 18 participants, including novices and experts. Our results show contrasts in the impact of LOD on experience and comprehension for experts and novices, and highlight the diversity of usage of visual augmentations by spectators.}

The experiment is designed to investigate possiblecorrelation between the perception of the "causality" of environmental sounds and different gesture strategies for thesound embodiment. In analogy with the perception of thesounds' causality, we propose to distinguish gestures that "mimic" a sound's cause and gestures that "trace" a sound'smorphology following temporal sound characteristics. Results from the interviews show that, first, our causal soundsdatabase lead to consistent descriptions of the action at theorigin of the sound and participants mimic this action. Second, non-causal sounds lead to inconsistent metaphoric descriptions of the sound and participants make gestures following sound "contours". Quantitatively, the results showthat gesture variability is higher for causal sounds that noncausal sounds.},

Biased training data and poor out-of-distribution generalization are deliberately leveraged as musical devices and sources of instrument-defining idiosyncrasies.

They use their movements to trigger audio in various microtonal tunings and incidentally generate scores. These scores are transmitted to performers who improvise music from this notation using Leap Motion Theremins, also in VR space. Finally, the performance is broadcast via a web audio stream, which can be heard by the composer-audience in the initial virtual world.

However, if a user has a general idea of the sound they are trying to program, they may be able to imitate it with their voice. This paper presents SynthAssist, a system for interactively searching the synthesis space of an audio synthesizer. In this work, we present how to use the system for querying a database of audio synthesizer patches (i.e. settings/parameters) by vocal imitation and user feedback. To account for the limitations of the human voice, it uses both absolute and relative time series representations of features and relevance feedback on both the feature weights and time series to refine the query. The method presented in this paper can be used to search through large databases of previously existing ``factory presets'' or program a synthesizer using the data-driven approach to automatic synthesizer programming.}

By comparing both designs, we highlight key architectural differences between the models that impact their instrumental performance capability, arguing that no model fits all purposes, and calling for their careful selection for each interactive design. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities for leveraging low-latency waveform autoencoders to develop interactive systems, such as Digital Musical Instruments, that can foster control intimacy through enhanced responsiveness and space for nuance.}

This interface consists of a semi-translucent screen embedded with light-detecting sensors. These sensors register the movement of the violinist's shadow and produce data that can be mapped to generate, trigger, or process sound in Max/MSP. The Shadow Harvester turns a human shadow into a real-time, life-size avatar, splitting the attention of the violinist between their shadow self and carnal self. They are ensnared in a web of sensors that require the same attention as the visceral joints in their body because any movement carries sonic repercussions through either their physical body playing the violin or their shadow body ``playing'' this interface. The Shadow Harvester creates a highly entangled feedback loop between the violinist, centuries of violin performance practice, and composition. As such, it carries the potential to encourage new ways of incorporating movement into the folds composition, notation, and performance.}

The Deaf and Hard of Hearing cannot experience the sound in the same way. Instead, they are able to physically experience the vibrations, nuances, contours, as well as its correspondence with the hand gestures. Those who are not hard of hearing can experience the sound, but also feel it just the same, with the knowledge that the same physical vibrations are shared by everyone. The employment of sign language adds another aesthetic dimension to the instrument --a nuanced borrowing of a functional communication medium for an artistic end.}

Specifically, these are instruments that are physical in that they use bodily interaction, take advantage of the physical affordances of the laptop. They are embodied in the sense that instruments are played in such ways where the sound is embedded to be close to the instrument. Three distinct laptop instruments, Taptop, Armtop, and Blowtop, are introduced in this paper. We discuss the integrity of the design process with composing for laptop instruments and performing with them. In this process, our aim is to blur the boundaries of the composer and designer/engineer roles. How the physicality is achieved by leveraging musical gestures gained through traditional instrument practice is studied, as well as those inspired by body gestures. We aim to explore how using such interaction methods affects the communication between the ensemble and the audience. An aesthetic-first qualitative evaluation of these interfaces is discussed, through works and performances crafted specifically for these instruments and presented in the concert setting of the laptop orchestra. In so doing, we reflect on how such physical, embodied instrument design practices can inform a different kind of expressive and performance mindset.}

This interface provides participants with more embodied listening opportunities and felt experiences of sound and music. All participants reported that the listening experience highlighted their first-person experience, focusing on their bodies, "regardless of an observer". These findings show how we can improve both such an internal experience of the listener and the collaboration potential between performers for increased inclusion.

At least 4 sensors are required: 2 for the front and 2 for the back; this prototype uses 6. The sensors are rather inexpensive, widening the economic availability. For each individual musician, the algorithms are capable of ``personalising'' postures in order to create consistent evaluations; the results of which may be, but are not limited to: new musical interfaces, educational analysis of technique, or music controllers. In building a prototype for the algorithms, data was acquired by wiring the sensors to a data-logger. The algorithms and tests were implemented using MATLAB. After designing the algorithms, various tests were run in order to prove their reliability. These determined that indeed the algorithms work to a sufficient degree of certainty, allowing for a reliable classification of a musician's posture or position.}

Various approaches are considered for developing mapping strategies that create transparent metaphors to facilitate expression for both the performer and the audience. We explore strategies in the input, intermediate, and output mapping layers using a two-step approach guided by Perry's Principles [2]. First, we use trial-and-error to establish simple mappings between single input parameter control and effects to identify promising directions for further study. Then, we compose a specific piece that supports different uses of the BendShape mappings in a performance context: this allows us to study a performer trying different types of expressive techniques, enabling us to analyse the role each mapping has in facilitating musical expression. We also investigate the effects these mapping strategies have on performer bandwidth. Our main finding is that the high fidelity of the novel BendShape sensor facilitates creating interpretable input representations to control sound representations, and thereby match interpretations that provide better expressive mappings, such as with vocal shape to vocal sound and bumpiness control; however, direct mappings of individual, independent sensor mappings to effects does not provide obvious advantages over simpler controls. Furthermore, while the BendShape sensor enables rich explorations for sound, the ability to find expressive interpretable shape-to-sound representations while respecting the performer's bandwidth limitations (caused by having many coupled input degrees of freedom) remains a challenge and an opportunity.}

By using a combination of microphones and MIDI triggers, audio signal features such as the velocity of the strike of the drum, or the frequency at which the drum resonates, are tracked, interpolated, and scaled to user specifications. The resulting series of recordings is comprised of the digitally generated output of the modulation engine, in addition to both raw and modulated signals from the acoustic drum set. In this way, this project explores drum set augmentation not only at the input and from a performative angle, but also at the output, where the acoustic and the synthesized elements are merged into each other, forming a sonic hybrid.},

The project is a series of responsive, self-regulating, and autonomous installations driven by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and incorporating ritual and sacred sounds from South Asia. Such m\'elange re-emphasizes and advocates for the values of interconnectivity, codependence, network, and community with a decolonial approach. By giving the AI an autonomous agency, the project aims to reimagine the future of AI with an inter-subjective reciprocity in human-machine assemblages transcending the technologically deterministic approach to AI-driven live art, media arts and music. Through unpacking the project, this paper underscores the necessity to dehegemonize the AI-driven music field towards a transcultural exchange, thereby transcend the field's Eurocentric bias.}

Our hypothesis is that using evolutionary algorithms with VR for musical interactions will lead to increased user telepresence. In addition to this, REVOLVE was designed to inform novel research into this unexplored area. Think aloud trials and thematic analysis revealed 5 main themes: control, comparison to the real world, immersion, general usability and limitations, in addition to practical improvements. Overall, it was found that this combination of technologies did improve telepresence levels, proving the original hypothesis correct.}

We further explore these concepts through a design case study. Our findings suggest that embodied musical experiences offer unique opportunities to cultivate environmental consciousness, contributing to a deeper understanding of sustainable musical interfaces relying on artistic expressions.}

Specifically, it maps higher breath velocity to higher octaves, with the modulo remainder controlling the microtonal pitch bend. This novel mapping reproduces a highly realistic flute-playing experience. Furthermore, changing the parameters easily augments the interface into a hyperinstrument that allows the player to control microtones more expressively via breathing techniques.}

The hardware system, including the sensor itself, was made in a DIY approach, which provides an economical and high-quality design strategy for implementing a multi-touch interface. Moreover, it is combined with a unique gesture mapping strategy that integrates multi-dimensional parameter mapping and continuous gesture tracking, enabling an expressive performance that is highly flexible to configure in various settings.}

It is a "hands free" instrument, utilizing a non-contact tactile feedback method based on airborne ultrasound. The three main elements/components of the interface that will be discussed in this paper are: 1. Generation of audible sound by self-demodulation of an ultrasound signal during its propagation through air; 2. The condensation of the ultrasound energy in one spatial point generating a precise tactile reproduction of the audible sound; and 3. The feed-forward method enabling a real-time intervention of the musician, by shaping the tactile (ultra)sound directly with his hands.},

We examine the availability and completeness of resources needed to recreate DGM models, and discuss specific challenges encountered during such recreation. Drawing from this experience, we highlight key obstacles that hinder the long-term viability and reuse of DGMs in the NIME context, and propose guidelines to improve their documentation and future reuse within the community.}

Following this discussion is a first-person anecdotal account of the author/composer's sonic explorations using crystal singing bowls in combination with the shards of broken bowls and custom electronics to create a body of recorded, acoustic, and electroacoustic musical works named Crushed Matrices \#1-7. The last section of this paper explains how the extended musical techniques unearthed through the Crushed Matrices investigations informed the creation of the shard-speakers, and the electronically-generated musical content that was composed for them in the form of a sound artwork, Ode on Crushed Matrices. This recording was fed into the shard-speakers via tactile transducers on resonating bodies for the 2022 inaugural installation of the work, which at the time of writing is the only installation of the work to date. The paper's conclusion addresses the relationship of this body of work to the NIME 2023 conference's theme of ``Frugal Music Innovation,'' correlating or otherwise characterizing its relationship to several of the core competencies set forth by the Frugal Innovation Hub: adaptability, lightness of weight, mobile design, affordability, local material sourcing, and ruggedness.}

The originality of this interaction is threefold. First, it covers the whole interaction cycle from the input (the dancer's movements) to the output (the generated music). Second, this interaction isn't direct but goes through a high level of abstraction: dancer's emotional expression is recognized and is the source of music generation. Third, this interaction has been designed and validated through constant collaboration with a choreographer, culminating in an augmented ballet performance in front of a live audience.},

This work follows in the vein of bytebeat practices, in which music is generated by short code snippets at the level of individual audio samples, but takes things further by relying on an even lower-level form of computation. In addition to presenting the system, I offer some preliminary analysis of why these logic gate networks tend to produce musical output.}

This approach bridges embodied performance with computational sound generation, enabling expressive and intuitive interaction. The system features a glove-based design with EMG sensors for each finger and motion detection for the wrist and arm, allowing seamless control of musical parameters. By addressing key challenges in DMI design, such as action-sound immediacy and performer-instrument dynamics, EMMA contributes to developing expressive and adaptable tools for contemporary music-making.}

Polyphony gives our instrument an organ-like personality: keys are mapped to different frequencies and the pressure applied to them determines volume. The siren organ can produce a large range of sounds both timbrally and dynamically. In addition to a siren timbre, the instrument produces similar sounds to a harmonica. Portability, robustness, and electronic stability are all areas for improvement.}

Motion capture data was analyzed by comparing a subject's hand height variability and timing accuracy across the four instruments as they performed simple musical tasks. Results suggest that certain gestures such as hand height amplitude can be adapted to these gestural controllers with little change and that in general subjects' timing variability is significantly affected when playing on the Lightning and Radio Baton when compared to the more familiar tom drum and VDrum. Possible explanations and other observations are also presented.},

To do this requires a deep consideration of the space of musical actions, so as to explicate what opposition should constitute, and machine listening technology (most prominently represented by new online beat and stream tracking algorithms) which gives an accurate measurement of player position so as to consistently avoid it.

This is the case for configurations with a high degree of mutual interdependence and shared control. This paper focuses on the design strategies for developing a software based conductor assistant for collective instruments. We propose a novel conductor dimension space representation for collective instruments, which takes into account both its social and structural features. We present a case study of a collective instrument implementing a software conductor. Finally, we discuss the implications of human and machine conduction schemes in the context of the proposed dimension space.}

  abstract = {Spinal cord injury is one of the most serious causes of disability that can affect people's lives. In tetraplegia, the loss of mobility of the upper limb has a devastating effect on the quality of life and independence of these patients, so their rehabilitation is considered a crucial objective. We present a tool for functional motor rehabilitation of the upper limb in patients with spinal cord injury, based on the use of bio-sensors and the sonification of EMG activity during the repetitive execution of a specific gesture. During the hospital stay, the patient has a wide range of therapies available to improve motor function or compensate for loss of mobility, including execution of different maneuvers. The repetitive and continuous performance of these tasks is a key element in motor recovery. However, in many cases, these tasks do not include sufficient feedback mechanisms to help the patient or to motivate him/her during execution. Through the sonification of movement and the design of adapted interaction strategies, our research aims to offer a new therapeutic tool that musically transforms the gesture and expands the patient's mechanisms of expression, proprioception and cognition, in order to optimize, correct and motivate movement.}

This ability for the browser to interface with most electronic instruments made in the past 30 years offers significant opportunities to preserve, enhance or re-discover a rich musical and technical heritage. By including MIDI in the broaderWeb ecosystem, this API also opens endless possibilities to create music in a networked and socially engaging way. However, the Web MIDI API specification only offers low-level access to MIDI devices and messages. For instance, it does not provide semantics on top of the raw numerical messages exchanged between devices. This is likely to deter novice programmers and significantly slow down experienced programmers. After reviewing the usability of the bare Web MIDI API, the WEBMIDI. js JavaScript library was created to alleviate this situation. By decoding raw MIDI messages, encapsulating complicated processes and providing semantically significant objects, properties, methods and events, the library makes it easier to interface with MIDI devices from compatible browsers. This paper first looks at the context in which the specification was created and then discusses the usability improvements layered on top of the API by the opensource WEBMIDI.js library.}

We show that NIME design using principles from soma design can offer creative opportunities in developing novel sensing mechanisms, which can in turn inform composition and further elicit curious engagements between performer and artefact, disrupting notions of performer-led control. As contributions, this work 1) offers an example of NIME design for situated living, feeling, performing bodies, and 2) presents the rich potential of soma design as a path for designing in this context.}

Feedboxes react to incoming sounds in simple, predefined manner. Yet, when used together, their behaviour may become quite complex. Each of two boxes has its own sound and set of simple rules.}

This paper focuses on the development of two types of flutes, the recorder and transverse flute, with interchangeable mouthpieces. These flutes are designed to play subharmonic microtonal scales. The discussion provides an overview of the design and implementation process, including calculation methods for acoustic modelling and 3D printing technologies, as well as an evaluation of some of the difficulties encountered. Results from our 3D printed flutes suggest that whilst further refinements are necessary in our designs, 3D modelling and printing techniques offer new and valuable methods for the design and production of customised musical instruments. The long term goal of this project is to create a system in which users can specify the tuning of their instrument to generate a 3D model and have it printed on demand.},

In the second version, control parameters are derived directly from playing on the same piano that performs the output of the system. Here, the performer both plays with and on the system in an intricate dance with the unpredictable output of the unstable virtual ensemble. The underlying mapping strategies are presented, together with the structure of the generative system.

The mapping technique, originally developed for other control interfaces but here adapted to the piano keyboard, is based on a dynamic vectorization of control parameters, allowing both wild sonic exploration and minute intimate expression. The original piano sound is used as the sole sound source, subjected to processing techniques such as virtual resonance strings, dynamic buffer shuffling, and acoustic and virtual feedback. Thanks to speaker and microphone placement, the acoustic and processed sounds interact in both directions and blend into one new instrument. This also allows for unorthodox playing (knocking, plucking, shouting). Processing parameters are controlled from the keyboard playing alone, allowing intuitive control of complex processing by ear, integrating expressive musical playing with sonic exploration. The instrument is not random, but somewhat unpredictable. This feeds into the improvisation, defining a particular idiomatics of the instruments. Hence, the instrument itself is an essential part of the musical work. Performances include concerts in UK, Japan, Singapore, Australia and Sweden, in solos and ensembles, performed by several pianists. Variations of this hybrid instrument for digital keyboards are also presented.}

The parameters of the string model are controlled through TouchKeys multitouch sensors on each key, combined with MIDI data and acoustic signals from the digital keyboard frame, using a novel mapping. The instrument is evaluated from a performing musician's perspective, and emerging playing techniques are discussed. Since the instrument is a hybrid acoustic-digital system with several feedback paths between the domains, it provides for expressive and dynamic playing, with qualities approaching that of an acoustic instrument, yet with new kinds of control. The contributions are two-fold. First, the use of acoustic sounds from a physical keyboard for excitations and resonances results in a novel hybrid keyboard instrument in itself. Second, the digital model of "inside piano" playing, using multitouch keyboard data, allows for performance techniques going far beyond conventional keyboard playing.}

  abstract = {Libration Perturbed is a performance and an improvisation instrument, originally composed and designed for a multi-speaker dome. The performer controls a bank of 64 virtual inter-connected resonating strings, with individual and direct control of tuning and resonance characteristics through a multitouch-enhanced klavier interface (TouchKeys). It is a hybrid acoustic-electronic instrument, as all string vibrations originate from physical vibrations in the klavier and its casing, captured through contact microphones. In addition, there are gestural strings, called ropes, excited by performed musical gestures. All strings and ropes are connected, and inter-resonate together as a ''super-harp'', internally and through the performance space. With strong resonance, strings may go into chaotic motion or emergent quasi-periodic patterns, but custom adaptive leveling mechanisms keep loudness under the musician's control at all times. The hybrid digital/acoustic approach and the enhanced keyboard provide for an expressive and very physical interaction, and a strong multi-channel immersive experience. The paper describes the aesthetic choices behind the design of the system, as well as the technical implementation, and -- primarily -- the interaction design, as it emerges from mapping, sound design, physical modeling and integration of the acoustic, the gestural, and the virtual. The work is evaluated based on the experiences from a series of performances.}

  abstract = {The idea behind the YouHero was two-fold. First, to make an expressive instrument out of the computer game toy guitar controller from the famous game GuitarHero. With its limited amount of control parameters, this was a challenge. Second, through this instrument we wanted to provide an alternative to the view that you become a hero by perfect imitation of your idols. Instead, play yourself. You are the hero. In this paper, we describe the design of the instrument, including its novel mapping approach based on switched timbre vectors scaled by accellerometer data, unconventional sound engines and the sound and mapping editing features, including manual editing of individual vectors. The instrument is evaluated through its practical applications during the whole project, with workshops with teenagers, a set of state-funded commissions from professional composers, and the development of considerable skill by the key performers. We have also submitted a performance proposal for this project.}

  abstract = {Motion sensing technologies enable musical interfaces where a performer moves their body "in the air" without manipulating or contacting a physical object. These interfaces work well when the movement and sound are smooth and continuous, but it has proven difficult to design a system which triggers discrete sounds with precision that allows for complex rhythmic performance. We conducted a study where participants perform ``air-drumming'' gestures in time to rhythmic sounds. These movements are recorded, and the timing of various movement features with respect to the onset of audio events is analyzed. A novel algorithm for detecting sudden changes in direction is used to find the end of the strike gesture. We find that these occur on average after the audio onset and that this timing varies with the tempo of the movement. Sharp peaks in magnitude acceleration occur before the audio onset and do not vary with tempo. These results suggest that detecting peaks in acceleration will lead to more naturally responsive air gesture instruments.}

Leveraging Eurorack synthesizer modules as a flexible prototyping toolkit enables an iterative prototyping process that explores the distinctive possibilities of one-handed musicianship. Reflection on a three-month period of iteration and refinement highlights a series of design issues, but also the interconnectedness of physical impairments, and the difficulties of designing for a body in flux. Some directions for future work are outlined. Finally, by discussing the various entangled layers of this instrument prototype, and starting to tease out what Koutsomichalis calls its ``stories of a sort'', this paper contributes an until now underrepresented perspective to the dialogue around accessible and inclusive musical instrument design, and disability and musicianship more broadly.}

Our application leverages modal interchange and parallel chord substitutions, offering intuitive navigation through microtonal harmonic trajectories. The implementation utilizes MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) via our custom MaxForLive application, The Bridge, ensuring precise microtonal control and compatibility with digital audio workstations (Ableton Live 11/12). The system includes real-time visualization, interactive chord manipulation, and a comprehensive Scale Editor for harmonic experimentation. Through practical examples and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate how this approach reveals new harmonic possibilities while maintaining connections to established modal frameworks. This research contributes to the growing microtonal music field by providing theoretical foundations and practical tools that incorporate extended tuning systems into contemporary musical practice.}

These profiles converge into proposed prototypes that transform into final designs after experts and performers' examination and feedback. We ground this method in the context of physically disabled musicians, and we show that the method provides a decolonial view to disability, as its purpose moves from the classical view of technology as an aid for allowing disabled communities to access well-established instruments, towards a new paradigm where technologies are used for the augmentation of expressive capabilities, the strengthening of social engagement, and the empowerment of music makers.}

Performers can control how many keys to remap through an expression pedal. If the pedal is not pressed the Sabotaging Piano works as a normal piano. When fully pressed, each key is remapped one semi-tone up or down with equal probability. Each new performance (i.e. when the piano is turned on) triggers a new and unknown remapping pattern, but the specific pattern remains fixed throughout the whole performance. This aims to provide a balance of uncertain but still explorable and learnable behaviour. We invited three professional piano improvisers to rehearse with our piano in order to prepare a final improvisation concert. We aimed to explore how much can be rehearsed or prepared with a piano that will behave somewhat differently for each new performance. We asked pianists to document their rehearsal processes to witness the appearing of strategies or techniques with the Sabotaging Piano. Through analysis of the rehearsals reports and the MIDI data collected in the final concert, here we show that the three pianists not only developed different techniques with the Sabotaging Piano, but they also leveraged the particularities of it to use them as creative resources.}

How does this idea, however, translate into more experimental scenes like NIME, where control and virtuosity are not necessarily the performance's aim? Moreover, within NIME communities the addition of randomness or constraints to musical instruments is often an intended aesthetic decision rather than a source of mistakes. To explore this contrast, we invited four NIME practitioners to participate in the Self-Sabotage Workshop, where each practitioner had to build their own sabotaging elements for their musical instruments and to give a short demonstration with them. We gathered participants' impressions of self-sabotating in a focus group, inquiring about control and musicality, and also the strategies they developed for coping with the self-sabotaged instruments. We discuss the emergent ideas of planned and unplanned sabotaging, and we propose a starting point towards the idea of self-sabotaging as a continuous design and musical process where designers/musicians try to overcome barriers that they impose upon themselves.}

  abstract = {Research on Accessible Digital Musical Instruments (ADMIs) has received growing attention over the past decades, carving out an increasingly large space in the literature. Despite the recent publication of state-of-the-art review works, there are still few systematic studies on ADMIs design analysis. In this paper we propose a formal tool to explore the main design aspects of ADMIs based on Dimension Space Analysis, a well established methodology in the NIME literature which allows to generate an effective visual representation of the design space. We therefore propose a set of relevant dimensions, which are based both on categories proposed in recent works in the research context, and on original contributions. We then proceed to demonstrate its applicability by selecting a set of relevant case studies, and analyzing a sample set of ADMIs found in the literature.}

The second, a music mashup system, determines the compatibility between beat-synchronous chromagrams from different pieces of music. Through the combination of these two techniques, a real-time time predict mashup can be generated towards a new form of automatic accompaniment for interactive musical performance.}

In contrast to this approach, this paper outlines a philosophical position concerning the relationship between instruments and performers in improvisational contexts that recognises the agency of the instrument within the performance process. It builds on a post-phenomenological understanding of the human/instrument relationship in which the human and the instrument are understood as co-defining entities without fixed boundaries; an approach that actively challenges notions of instrumental mastery and \&\#8216;absolute control'. This paper then takes a practice-based approach to outline how such philosophical concerns have fed into the design of an augmented, actuated cello system, The Feral Cello, that has been designed to explicitly explore these concerns through practice.}

Fiber optic cables are separated into bundles and then woven like a basket into a bendable glowing fabric. By equipping light emitting diodes to one side of these bundles and photodiode light intensity sensors to the other, loss of light intensity can be measured when the fabric is bent. The sensing technique of IllumiWear is not only able to discriminate between discreet touch, slight bends, and harsh bends, but also recover the location of deformation. In this way, our computational fabric prototype uses its intrinsic means of visual output (light) as a tool for interactive input. We provide design and implementation details for our prototype as well as a technical evaluation of its effectiveness and limitations as an interactive computational textile. In addition, we examine the potential of this prototype's interactive capabilities by extending our eTextile to create a tangible user interface for audio and visual manipulation.}

  abstract = {The use of transducers to excite physical modelling synthesisers with real-world audio signals is a well established practice within the digital musical instrument design community, yet it is normally presented as a unidirectional process -- energy is transferred into the system from human to instrument. In this paper, a novel approach to tactile interaction with physical modelling synthesis is presented, through the use of a self-sensing vibrotactile transducer. This enables simultaneous collocated sensing and haptic actuation with a single moving coil transducer. A current drive amplifier is used for haptic actuation, using signals derived from the physical modelling synthesiser. The varying impedance of the transducer (due to changes in the mechanical damping) enables the sensing of force applied upon the device whilst also acting as a pickup to excite the physical model, all with simultaneous haptic actuation. A digital filter equivalent of the transducer's impedance is used to prevent feedback in the system, allowing simultaneous excitation and haptic actuation without self-oscillation.}

This paper embodies the more recent acknowledgement of the importance of practice-based methods of evaluation [1,2,3,4] concerning the use of NIMEs within performance and the recognition that it is only within the situation of practice that the context is available to actually interpret and evaluate the instrument [2]. Within this context this paper revisits the Feral Cello performance system that was first presented at NIME 2017 [5]. This paper explores what has been learned through the artistic practice of performing and workshopping in this context by drawing heavily on the experiences of the performer/composer who has become an integral part of this project and co-author of this paper. The original philosophical context is also revisited and reflections are made on the tensions between this position and the need to `get something to work'. The authors feel the presentation of the semi-structured interview within the paper is the best method of staying truthful to Hayes understanding of musical improvisation as an enactive framework `in its ability to demonstrate the importance of participatory, relational, emergent, and embodied musical activities and processes' [4].}

A clear case of what is meant by this, is the ``stillness movement'' of a body part, occurring despite the simultaneous explicit intention for that body part to remain still. In this paper, we present the results of a randomized, controlled experiment investigating this phenomenon along a vertical axis relative to the human fingertip. The results include characterizations of both the spatial distribution and frequency distribution of the stillness movement observed. Also included are results indicating a possible role for constant forces and viscosities in reducing stillness movement amplitude, thereby potentially enabling the implementation of more positional control of musical sound within the same available spatial range. Importantly, the above is summarized in a form that is directly interpretable for anyone designing technologies, interactions, or performances that involve fingertip control of musical sound. Also, a complete data set of the experimental results is included in the separate Appendices to this paper, again in a format that is directly interpretable.}

First, within a historical context, a general absence of, and clear need for, tangible output that is dynamically instantiated by the grain-generating process itself is identified. Second, to fill this gap, a concrete general approach is proposed based on the careful construction of non-vibratory and vibratory force pulses, in a one-to-one relationship with sonic grains.An informal pilot psychophysics experiment initiating the approach was conducted, which took into account the two main cases for applying forces to the human skin: perpendicular, and lateral. Initial results indicate that the force pulse approach can enable perceivably multidimensional, tangible display of the ongoing grain-generating process. Moreover, it was found that this can be made to meaningfully happen (in real time) in the same timescale of basic sonic grain generation. This is not a trivial property, and provides an important and positive fundament for further developing this type of enhanced display. It also leads to the exciting prospect of making arbitrary sonic grains actual physical manipulanda.},

Vokinesis, a system for real-time rhythm and pitch modification and control of singing is presented. Pitch and vocal effort are controlled by a stylus on a graphic tablet. The concept of Syllabic Control Points (SCP) is introduced for timing and rhythm control. A chain of phonetic syllables have two types of temporal phases : the steady phases, which correspond to the vocalic nuclei, and the transient phases, which correspond to the attacks and/or codas. Thus, syllabic rhythm control methods need transient and steady phases control points, corresponding to the ancient concept of the arsis and thesis is prosodic theory. SCP allow for accurate control of articulation, using hand or feet. In the tap mode, SCP are triggered by pressing and releasing a control button. In the fader mode, continuous variation of the SCP sequencing rate is controlled with expression pedals. Vokinesis has been tested successfully in musical performances, using both syllabic rhythm control modes. This system opens new musical possibilities, and can be extended to other types of sounds beyond voice.}

An elastic rubber membrane forms the playing surface of the instrument, while machine learning is used for dimensionality reduction and gesture recognition. The membrane is stretched over a hollow shell which permits considerable depth excursion, with an array of distance sensors tracking the surface displacement from underneath. The inherent dynamics of the membrane lead to cross-coupling between nearby sensors, however we do not see this as a flaw or limitation. Instead we find this coupling gives structure to the playing techniques and mapping schemes chosen by the user. The instrument is best utilized as a tool for actively designing abstraction and forming a relative control structure within a given system, one which allows for intuitive gestural control beyond what can be accomplished with conventional musical controllers.}

The top key of the keyboard toggles between frequency filter mode and time slicer mode. In frequency filter mode the white keys provide seven bands of latched frequency filtering. In time slicer mode the white keys plus black B flat key provide latched on/off control of eight time slices of the loop. The system was informally evaluated by nine subjects. The frequency filter mode combined with loop switching worked well with the MIDI keyboard interface.

With the recent rise of tablet-based computing, the use of sketching as a control and interaction paradigm is one that deserves exploration. In this paper we present an interactive sketch-based music composition and performance system called Drawchestra. The aim of the system is to give users an intuitive way to convey their musical ideas to a computer system with the minimum of technical training thus enabling them to focus on the creative tasks of composition and performance. The system provides the user with a canvas upon which they may create their own instruments by sketching shapes on the tablet screen. The system recognises a certain set of shapes which it treats as virtual instruments or effects. Once recognised, these virtual instruments can then be played by the user in real time. The size of a sketched instrument shape is used to control certain parameters of the sound so the user can build complex orchestras containing many different shapes of different sizes. The sketched shapes may also be moved and resized as desired making it possible to customise and edit the virtual orchestra as the user goes along. The system has been implemented in Python and user tests conducted using an iPad as the control surface. We report the results of the user study at the end of the paper before briefly discussing the outcome and outlining the next steps for the system design.}

This constitutes an example of bottom-up live coding, which operates on a low level language to generate a high level structure output. Here we examine systematically how to apply mappings of continuous gestural interactions to develop a bottom-up system for predicting programming behaviours. We conducted a statistical analysis based on a controlled data generation procedure. The findings concur with the subjective experience of the behavior of the system when the user modulates the sampling frequency of a variable clock using a knob as an input device. This suggests that a sequential predictive model may be applied towards the development of a tactically predictive system according to Tanimoto's hierarchy of liveness.

These improvisations have been recorded using Motion Capture, in order to develop interfaces for co-located and telematic interactions for the sharing of narratives of migration. In this paper, using data from the Motion Capture experiments, we are exploring two specific movements from improvisers: displacements on space (walking, rotating), and breathing data. Here we envision how co-relations between walking and breathing, might be further studied to implement interfaces that help the making of connections between place, and the feeling of presence for people in-between distant locations.}

Such materials were obtained by applying biomaterial engineering and 3D modeling and printing as parallel processes. Sensattice seems to be an emerging system since it is not reduced to mere materials but involves people and situated epistemic approaches that literally shape a sculptural lattice through the sensory and symbolic perception of skin and bones that can be sounded before, during and after the sculptural construction.}

Integrating standard computer music tools in AR development would allow more rapid prototyping of new instrument ideas and transfer of knowledge from experienced computer musicians. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that AR digital musical instruments can be developed using libpd, the library version of the standard computer music environment Pure Data. We present a case study of an AR instrument developed for the Meta Quest 2 integrating libpd in the AR development tool-chain for the interactive audio components. The iterative development process was tracked through autoethnographic reflections and analysed with thematic analysis. We found that Pure Data was an effective way to develop audio interactions on the Quest 2 and that the hand tracking on this platform was capable of complex gestural interactions. This work could enable a broader community of computer musicians to explore AR NIME development, taking advantage of the unique affordances of this medium.}

Itbecomes apparent that sophisticated musical expressionrequires not only a good control interface but also virtuosicmastery of the instrument it controls. By studying effectiveacoustic instruments, choosing intuitive but complexgesture-sound mappings that take advantage of establishedinstrumental skills, designing intelligent characterizationsof performance gestures, and promoting long-term dedicatedpractice on a new interface, computer music instrumentdesigners can enhance the expressive quality of computermusic performance.},

Such an embedding is a representation or map of the different pitched energies in a song, and how these energies relate to each other in the context of the song. The paper presents an interactive version of this representation as an exploratory analytical tool or instrument for granular synthesis. Pointing and clicking on the interactive map recreates the acoustical energy present in the chroma blocks at that location, providing an effective way of both exploring the relationships between sounds in the original piece, and recreating a synthesized approximation of these sounds in an instrumental fashion.},

The lack of a traditional instrument requires the performer to study idiomatic strategies by which musicianship becomes apparent. On the other hand, the audience needs to decode those strategies, so to achieve an understanding and appreciation of the music being played. The issue is particularly relevant to the performance of music that results from the mediation between biological signals of the human body and physical performance. The present article tackles this concern by demonstrating a new model of musical performance; what I define biophysical music. This is music generated and played in real time by amplifying and processing the acoustic sound of a performer's muscle contractions. The model relies on an original and open source technology made of custom biosensors and a related software framework. The succesfull application of these tools is discussed in the practical context of a solo piece for sensors, laptop and loudspeakers. Eventually, the compositional strategies that characterize the piece are discussed along with a systematic description of the relevant mapping techniques and their sonic outcome.},

It is written in openFrameworks and consists of four distinct parts, the text editor, the language parser, the sequencer, and the music score. It supports the MIDI and OSC protocols to communicate the sequencer with other software or hardware, as LiveLily does not produce any sound. It can be combined with audio synthesis software that supports OSC, like Pure Data, SuperCollider, and others, or hardware synthesizers that support MIDI. This way, the users can create their sounds in another, audio-complete framework or device, and use LiveLily to control their music. LiveLily can also be used as a live scoring system to write music scores for acoustic instruments live. This feature can be combined with its live sequencing capabilities, so acoustic instruments can be combined with live electronics. Both live scoring and live sequencing in LiveLily provide expressiveness to a great extent, as many musical gestures can be included either in the score or the sequencer. Such gestures include dynamics, articulation, and arbitrary text that can be interpreted in any desired way, much like the way Western-music notation scores are written.}

Each ring contains a small, independently controlled exciter transducer commonly used for auditory bone conduction. The rings sound loudly when they touch a hard object, and are practically silent otherwise. When a wearer touches their own (or someone else's) head, the contacted person hears the sound through bone conduction, inaudible to others. The bracelet contains a microcontroller, a set of FET transistors, an accelerometer, and a battery. The microcontroller generates a separate audio signal for each ring, switched through the FETs, and can take user input through the accelerometer in the form of taps, flicks, and other gestures. The player controls the envelope and timbre of the sound by varying the physical pressure and the angle of their finger on the surface, or by touching differently resonant surfaces. Because its sound is shaped by direct, physical contact with objects and people, the FingerSynth encourages players to experiment with the materials around them and with one another, making music with everything they touch.}

Subtle, sound-active drawings by different visual designers anchor the one-page website. Using low latency, high fidelity WebRTC, our system allows guests to mix themselves in, remix the raw nature streams, or run our multichannel sources fully through their own processors. Created in early 2020 in response to the locked down conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, the site became a virtual oasis, with usage data showing long duration visits. In collaboration with several festivals that went online in 2020, programmed live content included music, storytelling, and guided meditation. One festival commissioned a local microphone installation, resulting in a second nature source for the station: 5-channels of sound from a small Maine island. Catalyzed by recent events, when many have been separated from environments of inspiration and restoration, we propose Living Sounds as both a virtual nature space for cohabitation and a new kind of contingent online venue.}

This particular instrument design approach works in parallel with a performance practice centered on live construction of new music, refinement of a groove and the creative process of troubleshooting. In my practice I use an extended turntable system, developing new electro-mechanical interfaces between a record player and various other devices. The paper describes my approach to developing the Mechanical Techno project, using the system in live musicking contexts and making iterations of the setup. The aesthetic aims of the project are defined in order to highlight the types of mechanical and electronic errors and flaws which are important to its success. Several specific examples are given by way of illustration, demonstrating how physical wobbles, imprecise triggering and out-of-sync mechanisms can lead to interesting and idiosyncratic elements in live performances and recorded compositions. The approach is summarised as a process of 'ironing in the creases': recognising the system's problems and -- counterintuitively -- deliberately emphasising them.}

Physical simulations can aid composers in creating musical gestures based in complex physical metaphors. CHON (Coupled Harmonic Oscillator Network) is a new crossplatform application for composing musical gestures based in Newtonian physics. It simulates a network of particles connected by springs and sonifies the motion of individual particles. CHON is an interactive instrument that can provide complex yet tangible and physically grounded control data for synthesis, sound processing, and musical score generation. Composers often deploy dozens of independent LFOs to control various parameters in a DAW or synthesizer. By coupling numerous control signals together using physical principles, CHON represents an innovation on the traditional LFO model of musical control. Unlike independent LFOs, CHON's signals push and pull on each other, creating a tangible causality in the resulting gestures. In this paper, I briefly describe the design of CHON and discuss its use in composition through examples in my own works.}

  abstract = {This study presents an ecosystemic approach to music interaction, through the practice-based development of a mixed reality installation artwork. It fuses a generative, immersive audio composition with augmented reality visualisation, within an architectural space as part of a blended experience. Participants are encouraged to explore and interact with this combination of elements through physical engagement, to then develop an understanding of how the blending of real and virtual space occurs as the installation unfolds. The sonic layer forms a link between the two, as a three-dimensional sound composition. Connections in the system allow for multiple streams of data to run between the layers, which are used for the real-time modulation of parameters. These feedback mechanisms form a complete loop between the participant in real space, soundscape, and mixed reality visualisation, providing a participant mediated experience that exists somewhere between creator and observer.}

  abstract = {The growing possibilities and availability of immersive technologies in the field of Extended Reality (XR) are leading to new potentials in the context of Musical XR, like the emergence of new concepts for virtual reality musical instruments (VRMIs), reception, and composition and performance practices. Recent XR devices for Virtual and Augmented Reality allow not only to present virtual content, but also to blend real and virtual environments to create hybrid Mixed Realities. Therefore, in addition to using standard interfaces such as controllers or hand tracking from XR systems for interacting with VRMIs, developing custom musical interfaces can provide enhanced physical possibilities and experiences for interacting with VRMIs and other virtual sound-generating systems. This paper describes the development and possibilities of an open-source modular interface system for the realization of VRMIs with physical musical interfaces, interactive installations and the augmentation of virtual environments with physical environmental information.The tool was created by integrating the SPINE sensor-based musical interface toolkit with the IVES modular 3D engine for the Max programming environment. Merging these systems, with their no-code/no-soldering approach, results in a customizable tool for rapidly creating VRMIs or augmented virtual environments with corresponding physical interfaces.}

Interaction gestures are touch and mobile-compatible and made with analogies to strummed, bowed, brushed, and plucked musical instrument controls. Point-and-click and drag-and-drop gestures directly control audio playback length and intensity. I show that I can modulate sound length and intensity by interacting with a programmable 2D grid and leveraging the speed and ubiquity of web browser-based audio and hardware acceleration to generate time-varying high-fidelity sounds with real-time interactivity. SnakeSynth adaptively reproduces and interpolates between sounds encountered during model training, notably without long training times, and I briefly discuss possible futures for deep generative models as an interactive paradigm for musical expression.}

The system not only aims to reflect emotional states but to direct and induce emotional states through the real-time generation of the score, highlighting the potential of direct neural-emotional manipulation in live performance. The EEG of the vocalist and one audience member is measured throughout the performance and the system generates a real-time score based on mapping the emotional features within the EEG. We measure the two emotional descriptors, valence and arousal, within EEG and map the two-dimensional correlate of averaged windows to musical phrases. These pre-composed phrases contain associated emotional content based on the KTH Performance Rules System (Director Musices). The piece is in three movements, the first two are led by the emotions of each subject respectively, whilst the third movement interpolates the combined response of the performer and audience member. The system not only aims to reflect the individuals' emotional states but also attempts to induce a shared emotional experience by drawing the two responses together. This work highlights the potential available in affecting neural-emotional manipulation within live performance and demonstrates a new approach to real-time, affectively-driven composition.}

I will in this paper report on how an augmented clarinet that I, together with a team at LTU began developing in 2015 has continued to develop over the past seven years. The focus will be on the development of artistic applications within the system. Performers frequently describe the resistance of their instrument as a manifestation of the challenges they encounter when playing. One can argue that the goal of a skilled performer is to get rid of resistance, but it is in fact a central part of the relationship between performer and instrument. Acquiring technique and skill seems to be a way for the performer not to overcome resistance but to learn how the instrument responds to force. Realizing the importance of resistance in the artistic process we need to ask ourselves; how can we use this knowledge when creating new instruments? Returning to video documentation of performances with two different mappings and through stimulated recall analysis I seek a deeper understanding of how software, mapping and performance practice interacts, forming the basis of the artistic expression.}

It differs most notably from the majority of ventures into the design of novel musical interfaces and installations in its multidisciplinary approach, drawing on techniques from Human-Computer Interaction, social sciences and ludology. Our User-Centered Design methodology was central to producing an interactive environment that enhances traditional performance with novel functionalities. During a formal experiment, musicians reported finding our system exciting and enjoyable. We also introduce some additional interactions that can further enhance the interactivity of our reactive environment. In describing the particular challenges of working with such a unique and creative user as the musician, we hope that our approach can be of guidance to interface developers working on applications of a creative nature.}

Placement of acoustic and mechanical actuators on the resonant body of the cello mean that this simple analogue feedback system is capable of a wide range of complex self-resonating behaviours. This paper describes the motivations for building these instruments as both a physical extension to live coding practice and an electroacoustic augmentation of cello. The design and physical construction is outlined, and modes of performance described with reference to the first six months of performances and installations.

Audio-morphing as a special field of DSP has a high complexity for the morph itself and for the parametrization of the transition between two sources. We propose a multi-touch enhanced interface for visual audiomorphing. This interface visualizes the internal processing and allows direct manipulation of the morphing parameters in the visualization.

Designed in the form of a stomp box, Biostomp translates a performer's muscle movements into control signals. A custom MMG sensor captures the acoustic output of muscle tissue oscillations resulting from contractions. An analog circuit amplifies and filters these signals, and a micro-controller translates the processed signals into pulses. These pulses are used to activate a stepper motor mechanism, which is designed to be mounted on parameter knobs on effects pedals. The primary goal in designing Biostomp is to offer a robust, inexpensive, and easy-to-operate platform for integrating biological signals into both traditional and contemporary music performance practices without requiring an intermediary computer software. In this paper, we discuss the design, implementation and evaluation of Biostomp. Following an overview of related work on the use of biological signals in artistic projects, we offer a discussion of our approach to conceptualizing and fabricating a biocontrol mechanism as a new musical interface. We then discuss the results of an evaluation study conducted with 21 professional musicians. A video abstract for Biostomp can be viewed at vimeo.com/biostomp/video.}

We then present our preliminary user study that investigated specific aspects of user engagement, including joy and boredom states, as well as perceptions of effort and control. The study's results underscore the musical background, expertise, and generational differences as significant influences on user experiences. Notably, test conditions characterized by greater randomness and rhythmic variation were consistently perceived as more engaging, and emerging trends were observed in user responses diverging over time.}

The instrument is built around two Myo armbands located on the forearms of the performer. These are used to investigate muscle contraction, which is again used as the basis for the sonic interaction design. Using a practice-based approach, the aim is to explore the musical aesthetics of naturally occurring bioelectric signals. We are particularly interested in exploring the differences between processing at audio rate versus control rate, and how the level of detail in the signal--and the complexity of the mappings--influence the experience of control in the instrument. This is exemplified through reflections on four concerts in which RAW has been used in different types of collective improvisation.}

The piece Vrengt grew from the idea of enabling a true partnership between a musician and a dancer, developing an instrument that would allow for active co-performance. Using a participatory design approach, we worked with sonification as a tool for systematically exploring the dancer's bodily expressions. The exploration used a "spatiotemporal matrix", with a particular focus on sonic microinteraction. In the final performance, two Myo armbands were used for capturing muscle activity of the arm and leg of the dancer, together with a wireless headset microphone capturing the sound of breathing. In the paper we reflect on multi-user instrument paradigms, discuss our approach to creating a shared instrument using sonification as a tool for the sound design, and reflect on the performers' subjective evaluation of the instrument.}

Grounded in five concepts from the theoretical literature on force dynamics in musical cognition, the paper presents a set of principles for interaction design focused on five force schemas: Path restraint, Containment restraint, Counter-force, Attraction, and Compulsion. We describe an initial set of examples that implement these principles using a Leap Motion sensor for gesture tracking and SuperCollider for interactive audio design. Finally, the paper presents a pilot experiment that provides initial ratings of intuitiveness in the user experience.}

The design of this Tangible Granular Device was primarily, though not exclusively, guided by the design principles of musical instruments with an enactive approach proposed by O'Modhrain and Essl in 2006, presented after the introduction of PebbleBox and CrumbleBag in 2004. Even two decades after these tactile interfaces, it remains crucial to question why a well-defined research trajectory on this subject has not been established. This places the search for new connections between granular synthesis techniques and tangible interface design at the core of this work, which aims to explore novel expressive forms of interaction with granular synthesis. To achieve this, an enactive exploration of physical materials with granular properties was conducted, followed by the implementation of an apparatus capable of capturing and recognizing interactions with these materials. Subsequently, the Tangible Granular Device was designed and implemented to facilitate interaction with these materials according to a set of guidelines of tangible interfaces and enactivism in musical instruments. Finally, the paper discusses the outcomes of the process, reflects on the current state of enactive design, and proposes improvements for future versions of this instrument.}

For the organ performance, we required a system capable of generating harmonic sequences in real-time, conditioned on Refree's performance. Instead of developing a comprehensive state-of-the-art model, we integrated a more traditional generative method to convert our pitch-agnostic rhythmic patterns into harmonic sequences. This paper details the development process, the creative and technical considerations behind the final performance, and a reflection on the efficacy and adaptability of the chosen methodology.}

  abstract = {Few formal methods exist for evaluating digital musical instruments (DMIs) .This paper proposes a novel method of DMI evaluation using crowd-sourcedtagging. One of the challenges in devising such methods is that the evaluationof a musical instrument is an inherently qualitative task. While previouslyproposed methods have focused on quantitative methods and largely ignored thequalitative aspects of the task, tagging is well-suited to this and is alreadyused to classify things such as websites and musical genres. These, like DMIs,do not lend themselves to simple categorization or parameterization. Using the social tagging method, participating individuals assign descriptivelabels, or tags, to a DMI. A DMI can then be evaluated by analyzing the tagsassociated with it. Metrics can be generated from the tags assigned to theinstrument, and comparisons made to other instruments. This can give thedesigner valuable insight into the where the strengths of the design lie andwhere improvements may be needed. A prototype system for testing the method is proposed in the paper and iscurrently being implemented as part of an ongoing DMI evaluation project. It isexpected that results from the prototype will be available to report by thetime of the conference in May.},

One part of this challenge is the problem of generating convincing accompaniment parts to a given melody, as could be used in an automatic accompaniment system. Despite much progress in this area, systems that can automatically learn to generate interesting sounding, as well as harmonically plausible, accompanying melodies remain somewhat elusive. In this paper we explore the problem of sequence to sequence music generation where a human user provides a sequence of notes, and a neural network model responds with a harmonically suitable sequence of equal length. We consider two sequence-to-sequence models; one featuring standard unidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, and the other featuring bidirectional LSTM, both successfully trained to produce a sequence based on the given input. Both of these are fairly dated models, as part of the investigation is to see what can be achieved with such models. These are evaluated and compared via a qualitative study that features 106 respondents listening to eight random samples from our set of generated music, as well as two human samples. From the results we see a preference for the sequences generated by the bidirectional model as well as an indication that these sequences sound more human.}

  abstract = {Sound generators and synthesis engines expose a large set of parameters, allowing run-time timbre morphing and exploration of sonic space. However, control over these high-dimensional interfaces is constrained by the physical limitations of performers. In this paper we propose the exploitation of vocal gesture as an extension or alternative to traditional physical controllers. The approach uses dynamic aspects of vocal sound to control variations in the timbre of the synthesized sound. The mapping from vocal to synthesis parameters is automatically adapted to information extracted from vocal examples as well as to the relationship between parameters and timbre within the synthesizer. The mapping strategy aims to maximize the breadth of the explorable perceptual sonic space over a set of the synthesizer's real-valued parameters, indirectly driven by the voice-controlled interface.},

The system I present is build with electronic circuits connected to dc-motors and allows for a very tangible and playful exploration of the dynamic properties of artificial neural networks. The theoretical underpinnings of this approach stem from observation and models of synchronization in living organisms, where synchronization and phase-locking is not only an observable phenomenon but can also be seen as a marker of the quality of interaction. Realized as a technical system of analogue oscillators synchronization also appears between oscillators tuned at different basic rhythm and stable polyrhythmic patterns emerge as the result of electrical connections.}

The apparatus is placed on an overhead projector and a visual presentation of these rhythmic patterns is delivered as a shadow play. The rhythmic patterns can be manipulated by modifying the environment of the robot, through direct physical interaction with the robot, by rewiring the internal connectivity, and by adjusting internal parameters. The theory of embodied cognition provides the theoretical basis of this device. The core postulate of embodied cognition is that biological behavior can only be understood through an understanding of the real-time interactions of an organism's nervous system, the organism's body and the environment. One the one hand the device illustrates this theory because the patterns that are created equally depend on the real-time interactions of the electronics, the physical structure of the device and the environment. On the other hand the device presents a synthesis of these ideas and it is effectively possible to play with it at all the three levels, the electronics, the physical configuration of the robot and the environment.}

Additionally, the Peripipe provides fumeovisual feedback, using color-illuminated smoke to display the system status.

Looking at ways people communicate non-verbally, we are developing three new instruments based on different communication channels. The Tooka is a hollow tube with a pressure sensor and buttons for each player. Players place opposite ends in their mouths and modulate the pressure in the tube with their tongues and lungs, controlling sound. Coordinated button presses control the music as well. The Pushka, yet to be built, is a semirigid rod with strain gauges and position sensors to track the rod's position. Each player holds opposite ends of the rod and manipulates it together. Bend, end point position, velocity and acceleration and torque are mapped to musical parameters. The Pullka, yet to be built, is simply a string attached at both ends with two bridges. Tension is measured with strain gauges. Players manipulate the string tension at each end together to modulate sound. We are looking at different musical mappings appropriate for two players.},

Two parameters are used to define thecontrol parameter space -- a simple automatic gain control system to controlthe output level, and a band-pass filter frequency for controlling the pitch ofthe feedback. This control parameter space is mapped to a corpus of soundscreated by these parameters and recorded, and these sounds are analysed usingsoftware created for concatenative synthesis. Following this process, thedescriptors taken from the analysis can be used to select control parametersfrom the feedback system.}

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been used to create mappings for digital musical instruments for over twenty-five years, and numerous ML toolkits have been developed for the NIME community. However, little published work has studied how ML has been used in sustained instrument building and performance practices. This paper examines the experiences of instrument builder and performer Laetitia Sonami, who has been using ML to build and refine her Spring Spyre instrument since 2012. Using Sonami's current practice as a case study, this paper explores the utility, opportunities, and challenges involved in using ML in practice over many years. This paper also reports the perspective of Rebecca Fiebrink, the creator of the Wekinator ML tool used by Sonami, revealing how her work with Sonami has led to changes to the software and to her teaching. This paper thus contributes a deeper understanding of the value of ML for NIME practitioners, and it can inform design considerations for future ML toolkits as well as NIME pedagogy. Further, it provides new perspectives on familiar NIME conversations about mapping strategies, expressivity, and control, informed by a dedicated practice over many years.}

The developed tools are centered around signal processing and simulation of electrophysiological signals. These techniques are used to clean and process the electrophysiological signals and subsequently provide real-time interactions to feed the control of sound processes. The system provides modules that are highly musically expressive especially in the domain of spatial sound. These tools also allow to set up a testing environment by replacing the need of electrophysiological capturing devices. The findings of this exploration provide a better understanding of how the FAUST language can be used in conjunction with electrophysiological signals and exposes interesting opportunities to explore further possibilities in music creation in an open source environment with the possibility of multitarget compilation, allowing our modules to be used either in such softwares as Max or embedded on microcontrollers.}

It works also as a performance instrument that stimulates collaborative remixings from compositions of scored interaction gestures called ``scenes''. The interface also aims to be a platform to exchange those sample packs as artistic releases, a format similar to the popular idea of an ``album'', but prepared to those four channel packs of samples and scores of interaction. It uses an adaptive audio slicing mechanism and it is based on interaction design for multi-touch screen features. A timing sequencer enhances the interaction between pre-set sequences (the ``scenes'') and screen manipulation scratching, expanding and moving graphic sound waves. This paper describes the graphical interface features, some development decisions up to now and perspectives to its continuity.}

The idea behind this project was to create an interface which enables the interaction between the performers and the effect processor measuring their brain waves amplitudes, e.g., alpha, beta, theta, delta and gamma, not necessarily with the user's awareness. We achieved this by using an electroencephalography (EEG) sensor for detecting performer's different emotional states and, based on these, sending midi messages for digital processing units automation. The aim is to create a new generation of digital processor units that could be automatically configured in real-time given the emotions or thoughts of the performer or the audience. By introducing emotional state information in the real time control of several aspects of artistic expression, we highlight the impact of surprise and uniqueness in the artistic performance.}

Through an exploration of the Soundrise reactivation, the article elaborates on each step of the proposed reactivation process, illustrating the application of the DPO and MDP model to ensure the preservation of the application. From the analysis of the previous iterations of the application, we also provide design reflections on obsolescence and longevity.

Documentation feeds the knowledge and the values with which to evaluate and discuss current achievements and musical creations as well as to plan for the future. Besides publishing our research in conferences and journals, sharing research materials and outcomes like software, hardware, instruments, and datasets is important. This allows others to use the latest technology and improve it. For this purpose, the repository is increasingly commonly used by researchers and artists to store and share their works. However, creating repositories does not follow a clear and organised structure like the one we find, for example, in papers. The heterogeneity of repositories makes it hard to use both practically and for analysis. Although the variety and differences of research products in the field of new musical technologies are obvious, we believe that defining repositories with common guidelines could significantly improve the critical discourse in this area. This issue has been discussed at the NIME conference through workshops and papers. In this article, we want to continue this discussion and propose a flexible repository template to organise and present research materials and outcomes in the field of musical technologies research.The article provides a short and focused review of how repositories are currently used at the NIME conference, with special attention to the platforms used. Based on this study, we introduce a repository template that will be applied to case studies. We hope this proposal will encourage further discussion and advancement on this issue and, at the same time, support and facilitate the creation of new repositories.}

The EG-IPT dataset, specifically designed for electric guitar, encompasses a broad range of IPTs captured across six distinct audio sources (five microphones and one direct input) and three pickup configurations. This diversity in recording conditions provides a robust foundation for training accurate models. We evaluate the dataset by employing a Convolutional Neural Network-based classifier (CNN), achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide array of IPT classes, thereby validating the dataset's efficacy. The ipt object is a new Max/MSP external enabling real-time classification of IPTs via pre-trained CNN models. While in this paper it's demonstrated with the EG-IPT dataset, the ipt object is adaptable to models trained on various instruments. By integrating EG-IPT and ipt , we introduce a novel, end-to-end workflow that spans from data collection, model training to real-time classification and human-computer interaction. This workflow exemplifies the entanglement of diverse components (data acquisition, machine learning, real-time processing, and interactive control) within a unified system, advancing the potential for dynamic, real-time music performance and human-computer interaction in the context of NIME.}

This paper describes the evaluation of the instrument in the form of a pilot study during a music festival in Berlin, Germany, as well as a case study with children and music teachers in a SEN school setting. We created a modular system composed of three modules that afford single user as well as collaborative music making. The pilot study was evaluated using informal observation and questionnaires (n = 39), and indicated that the instrument affords music making for people with and without prior musical knowledge across all age groups and fosters collaborative musical processes. The case study was based on observation and a qualitative interview. It confirmed that the instrument meets the needs of the school settings and indicated how future versions could expand access to all students. especially those experiencing complex disabilities. In addition, out-of-the-box functionality seems to be crucial for the long-term implementation of the instrument in a school setting.}

This applies particularly but not exclusively to the so-called group of people with physical and/or mental disabilities. This paper presents two Accessible Digital Musical Instruments (ADMIs) that were specifically designed for the students of a Special Educational Needs (SEN) school with a focus on intellectual disabilities. With SnoeSky, we present an ADMI in the form of an interactive starry sky that integrates into the Snoezel-Room. Here, users can 'play' with 'melodic constellations' using a flashlight. SonicDive is an interactive installation that enables users to explore a complex water soundscape through their movement inside a ball pool. The underlying goal of both ADMIs was the promotion of self-efficacy experiences while stimulating the users' relaxation and activation. This paper reports on the design process involving the users and their environment. In addition, it describes some details of the technical implementaion of the ADMIs as well as first indices for their effectiveness.}

Reflecting on previous work in the VR and interactive music field, the paper outlines key design decisions that were made in the development of the work over a period of 8 months, including a pilot presentation with participants. The paper discusses the implications of stylised VR design and the use of theatrical elements outside the digital environment to make music more accessible. It highlights the potential of VR in transforming the traditional roles of composer, performer, and listener, thus expanding the scope of participatory musical experiences.}

The research is part of an ongoing project (IRESAP) concerned with tools incorporating current music information retrieval strategies that both support artistic practices and have utility outside of a performance setting. In The Unfinder, we aim to exploit the balance between accurately and reliably retrieving audio material from a file search system, and the potential for failure in the system to do so. Our prior research is used to frame design choices which are measured with a user study used to evaluate the interface. In the study we observed nine users of varying musical backgrounds playing with the instrument while taking notes of their utterances and ideas. The transcriptions of the user's comments were analyzed using a thematic analysis method and five (5) themes were identified: perception, parameterization, identity, agency, and imaginaries. These themes indicate that the interface design is promising for artistic output, the use of a single feature for searching does not have much perceptual relevance, and the chosen features are useful for discovering audio files within serendipitous musical situations.}

Proposing a practice of "Body Lutherie," we explore how digital instrument designers can honour and work with living, dynamic bodies. Our design of a breath-based vocal wearable instrument incorporated uncontrollable aspects of a vocalist's body and its physical change over different timescales. We distinguish the body in the design process and acknowledge its agency in vocal instrument design. Reflection on our co-design process between vocal pedagogy and eTextile fashion perspectives demonstrates how Body Lutherie can generate empathy and understanding of the body as a collaborator in future instrument design and artistic practice.}

We present a system for sample exploration that allows audio clips to be sorted according to user taste, and arranged in any desired 2D formation such that similar samples are located near each other. Our method relies on two advances in machine learning. First, metric learning allows the user to shape the audio feature space to match their own preferences. Second, kernelized sorting finds an optimal arrangement for the samples in 2D. We demonstrate our system with two new interfaces for exploring audio samples, and evaluate the technology qualitatively and quantitatively via a pair of user studies.}

We measured a round-trip latency of 4.81 ms when mapping signals at 100 Hz with embedded libmapper and an average inter-onset delay of 3.03 ms for synchronizing with Ableton Link. On top of this infrastructure, we developed MapLooper: a live-looping tool with 2 example musical applications: a harp synthesizer with SuperCollider and embedded source-filter synthesis with FAUST on ESP32. Our system is based on a novel approach to mapping, extrapolating from using FIR and IIR filters on gestural data to using delay-lines as part of the mapping of DMIs. Our system features rhythmic time quantization and a flexible loop manipulation system for creative musical exploration. We open-source all of our components.}

An online survey was conducted to examine the differences in user experiences between digital and physical albums, and this informed the development of a physical music album incorporating AR. We provided 8 K-POP fans, who engage with physical albums more frequently than fans of other genres, the opportunity to test existing AR-integrated albums and a new prototype featuring AR packaging animations, multiplayer virtual concerts, and interactive photo features. The results underscored the importance of understanding and respecting fan culture when using AR. The results suggest that, compared to digital albums, physical albums derive significant experiential value from traditional supplementary materials such as booklets and lyric cards. However, AR has the potential as a complementary new material to provides users with novel experiences. This work leads to a reconsideration of Walter Benjamin's concept of aura, which critiques the reproducibility of art.}

The first is that the system needs to be trained with individual example gestures, the starting and ending points of which need to be well defined. The second constraint is time required for the system to recognise that a gesture has occurred, which may prevent the quick action that musical performance typically requires. This article describes how a method for unsupervised segmentation of gestures, may be used for delayed gestural control of a musical system. The system allows a user to perform without explicitly indicating the starting and ending of gestures in order to train the machine learning algorithm. To demonstrate the feasibility of the system, an apparatus for control of musical sound was devised incorporating the time required by the process into the interaction paradigm. The unsupervised automatic segmentation method and the concept of delayed control are further proposed to be exploited in the design and implementation of systems that facilitate seamless human-machine musical interaction without the need for quick response time, for example when using broad motion of the human body.}

Pushing against the driving force of economic structures, which emphasises a continuous cycle of replacement, musicians and instrument designers are drawing on a shared history to create new pieces of art and machines. This can be read as reflecting NIME's Code of Practice and, more generally, the unfolding climate crisis.For some, NIME may convey a focus on new musical instruments, but here, we focus on the notion of new through the diffracted lens of the old. Defined in recent NIME conferences by zooming in on the 'O' in NIME through the importance of reusing and repurposing old musical instruments and, in our case, old practices and processes. This paper considers magnetic tape and the machines that process it as the material and instrument.Following a survey, we present a diffracted reading through an intra-related process of how musicians, producers, and others who work with audio integrate tape into their practice. Drawing on post-humanist theories, we explore how slowness, community, and the old can inform NIME as a methodology. It provides insight for NIME to continue moving forward while focusing, through its Code of Practice, on sustainability, connection with our past, our history, years of artistic practice, and workflows that re not simply optimised for efficiency or the new.}

Using a touch sensitive surface or a 3D-Joystick a player can move through the pitch space and create the desired sound by selecting tones. The more optimal the tones are geometrically arranged, the less control parameters are required to move through the space and to select the desired pitches. For this the quality of pitch space based musical interfaces depends on two factors: 1. the way how the tones are organized within the pitch space and 2. the way how the parameters of a given controller are used to move through the space and to select pitches. This paper presents a musical interface based on a tonal pitch space derived from a four dimensional model found by the music psychologists [11], [2]. The proposed pitch space particularly eases the creation of tonal harmonic music. Simultaneously it outlines music psychological and theoretical principles of music.},

The BioSynth has facilitated the creation of work involving performers from a variety of ages and professional experiences, contributing to knowledge regarding emotional performance, exposing the differences between perceived and felt emotion within biofeedback art, extending emotional quantification techniques to notions of emotional performance technique, emotional labor, and what feminist Alva Gotby calls emotional reproduction. The design of the BioSynth privileges relational and real-world interactions as well as feminist thought regarding gendered hierarchies between body, mind, musical notation, social context, emotion and reason, and the division between performers and composers. This feminist inquiry has led to the development of alternatives to traditional frameworks for biofeedback music that rely on metaphors of musical instrumentation. After an introduction presenting two lived scenarios, this article is divided into three sections: hardware, software, and wetware. The hardware section describes the BioSynth through its design, which privileges ease-of-use for non-expert users. The software section describes mapping considerations based on feminist principles of measuring the emotional subject only against itself. Finally, in the wetware section I describe a feminist-inspired approach to emotional performance that embraces artificiality, irony, play, pleasure, and performance in biofeedback art, implying novel models for composer-instrument-performer relations.}

Preliminary findings suggest that smart tangibles were preferred, but that an optimal interface would include a combination of touch, smart tangibles and an extra function control tangible for extending the functionality of the smart tangibles. Finally, the interface should incorporate both an edit and mix mode---the latter displaying very limited visual feedback in order to force users to focus their attention to listening instead of the interface.},

Traditionally, music mixing consoles employ a channels strip control metaphor for adjusting parameters such as volume and panning of each track. An alternative control metaphor, the so-called stage metaphor lets the user adjust volume and panning by positioning tracks relative to a virtual listening position. In this study test participants are given the task to adjust volume and panning of one channel (in mixes consisting of three channels) in order to replicate a series of simple pre-rendered mixes. They do this using (1) a small physical mixing controller and (2) using an iPad app, which implements a simple stage metaphor interface. We measure how accurately they are able to replicate mixes in terms of volume and panning and how fast they are at doing so. Results reveal that performance is surprisingly similar and thus we are not able to detect any significant difference in performance between the two interfaces. Qualitative data however, suggests that the stage metaphor is largely favoured for its intuitive interaction --- confirming earlier studies.}

This approach is intended to provide new tools to facilitate bothcollaboration between visual artists and musicians and examination of perceptual issues between visual and acousticmedia. As a proof-of-concept, a complete example is developed with linear fractals as a basis for the animation, andarranged rhythmic loops for the music. Since both visualand acoustic elements in the example are generated fromconcise specifications, the potential of this approach to create new works through parameter space exploration is accentuated, however, there are opportunities for applicationto a wide variety of source material. These additional applications are also discussed, along with issues encounteredin development of the example.},

  abstract = {The Instant Instrument Anywhere (IIA) is a small device which can be attached to any metal object to create an electronic instrument. The device uses capacitive sensing to detect proximity of the player's body to the metal object, and sound is generated through a surface transducer which can be attached to any flat surface. Because the capacitive sensor can be any shape or size, absolute capacitive thresholding is not possible since the baseline capacitance will change. Instead, we use a differential-based moving sum threshold which can rapidly adjust to changes in the environment or be re-calibrated to a new metal object. We show that this dynamic threshold is effective in rejecting environmental noise and rapidly adapting to new objects. We also present details for constructing Instant Instruments Anywhere, including using smartphone as the synthesis engine and power supply.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new visualization paradigm for graphical interpolation systems, known as Star Interpolation, that has been specifically created for sound design applications. Through the presented investigation of previous visualizations, it becomes apparent that the existing visuals in this class of system, generally relate to the interpolation model that determines the weightings of the presets and not the sonic output. The Star Interpolator looks to resolve this deficiency by providing visual cues that relate to the parameter space. Through comparative exploration it has been found this visualization provides a number of benefits over the previous systems. It is also shown that hybrid visualization can be generated that combined benefits of the new visualization with the existing interpolation models. These can then be accessed by using an Interactive Visualization (IV) approach. The results from our exploration of these visualizations are encouraging and they appear to be advantageous when using the interpolators for sound designs tasks. Therefore, it is proposed that formal usability testing is undertaken to measure the potential value of this form of visualization.}

Ultimately, this pull alters the sine wave, creating the signature sound of the theremin. The Theremin Textural Expander (TTE) explores other textures the theremin can produce when its sound is processed and manipulated through a Max/MSP patch and controlled via a MIDI pedalboard. The TTE extends the theremin's ability, enabling it to produce five distinct new textures beyond the original. It also features a looping system that the performer can use to layer textures created with the traditional theremin sound. Ultimately, this interface introduces a new way to play and experience the theremin; it extends its expressivity, affording a greater range of compositional possibilities and greater flexibility in free improvisation contexts.},

Inspired by a period of deep listening to cicada stridulations -- in which I found the spatio-temporal pulsation of the sound mass reminiscent of breathing -- this installation uses breath control to give a sense of breathing with a forest. The sound mass consists of multiple generative sources, each loosely modelled on an individual cicada stridulating. Each `cicada' comprises a temporal hierarchy of pulse trains modulating a carrier frequency, with a simple sonic spatialization algorithm applied to give the sense of immersion in the sound mass. The algorithm is implemented in the Extempore audiovisual programming language, and utilizes an architecture in which each sonic parameter is inherently stochastic, much as the sound production mechanisms of actual cicadas exhibit natural variation.}

Signals are rerouted using a crossfading scheme that avoids the harsh clicks and pops associated with amplitude discontinuities. The unit generators are easily controllable using a click and drag interface that responds using familiar physics. CollideFx brings the interactivity of a video game together with the purpose of creating interesting and complex audio effects. With little difficulty, users can craft custom effects, or alternatively, can fling a unit generator into a cluster of several others to obtain more surprising results, letting the physics engine do the decision making.}

In this paper, we present the P(l)aying Attention framework for manipulating recorded music to support these people, and to help the therapists that work with them. The aim is to facilitate body awareness, exploration, and expressivity by allowing the manipulation of a pre-recorded `ensemble' through an interpretation of body movement, provided by a machine-learning system trained on physiotherapist assessments and movement data from people with chronic pain. The system considers the nature of a person's movement (e.g. protective) and offers an interpretation in terms of the joint-groups that are playing a major role in the determination at that point in the movement, and to which attention should perhaps be given (or the opposite at the user's discretion). Using music to convey the interpretation offers informational (through movement sonification) and creative (through manipulating the ensemble by movement) possibilities. The approach offers the opportunity to explore movement and music at multiple timescales and under varying musical aesthetics.}

Pieces of music are typically rearrangeable on-the-fly and involve a high degree of variation from ensemble to ensemble, and even between rehearsal and performance. Computer systems aiming to participate in such ensembles must therefore cope with a dynamic high-level structure in addition to the more traditional problems of beat-tracking, score-following, and machine improvisation. There are many approaches to integrating the components required to implement dynamic human-computer music performance systems. This paper presents a reference architecture designed to allow the typical sub-components (e.g. beat-tracking, tempo prediction, improvisation) to be integrated in a consistent way, allowing them to be combined and/or compared systematically. In addition, the paper presents a dynamic score representation particularly suited to the demands of popular music performance by computer.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a novel music control sensate surface, which enables integration between any musical instruments with a v ersatile, customizable, and essentially cost-effective user interface. This sensate surface is based on c onductive inkjet printing technology which allows capacitive sensor electrodes and connections between electronics components to be printed onto a large roll of flexible substrate that is unrestricted in length. The high dynamic range capacitive sensing electrodes can not only infer touch, but near-range, non-contact gestural nuance in a music performance. With this sensate surface, users can ``cut'' out their desired shapes, ``paste'' the number of inputs, and customize their controller interface, which can then send signals wirelessly to effects or software synthesizers. We seek to find a solution for integrating the form factor of traditional music controllers seamlessly on top of one's music instrument and meanwhile adding expressiveness to the music performance by sensing and incorporating movements and gestures to manipulate the musical output. We present an example of implementation on an electric ukulele and provide several design examples to demonstrate the versatile capabilities of this system.},

It consisted of six acoustic guitars, each equipped with a Bela embedded computer for sound processing (in Pure Data), an infrared distance sensor to detect the presence of users, and an actuator attached to the guitar body to produce sound. With an attached battery pack, the result was a set of completely autonomous instruments that were easy to hang in a gallery space. The installation encouraged explorations on the boundary between the tactile and the kinesthetic, the body and the mind, and between motion and sound. The use of guitars, albeit with an untraditional `performance' technique, made the experience both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. Many users reported heightened sensations of stillness, sound, and vibration, and that the `inverse' control of the instrument was both challenging and pleasant.},

This article examines Refraction Interlude, an interactive environment for solo performer and transducer-actuated metal percussion instruments. Building on a decade of reembodied sound research, the work combines augmented and actuated instruments, physical modeling, pre-recorded performer input, interactivity, and sound spatialization in a manner that facilitates adaptability to performer creativity and to the acoustic properties of the actuated instruments. The computational processes were minimized, designed to forefront the interaction and integration between these multiple domains.}

In our example we illustrate this concept by using the audiovisual recording of an instrumental performance as a source. Our system provides an alternative interface to the musical instrument's audiovisual corpus: as the instrument's sound and behavior is accessed in ways that are not possible on the instrument itself, the resulting non-linear playback of the grains generates an instant remix in a cut-up aesthetic. The presented instrument is a human-computer interface that employs the structural outcome of machine analysis accessing audiovisual corpora in the context of a musical performance.}

By shaping mycelium into tubes and adding recorder heads, playable flute-like instruments were created. However, their condition and playability were highly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. The study emphasizes embracing uncertainty and suggests that these imperfections can offer new insights into musical instrument design.}

Longevity is generally regarded as a valuable quality that good design criteria should help to achieve. However, the nature of the tools, of the performance conditions and of the music itself may lead to think of ephemerality as an intrinsic modality of the existence of DMIs. In particular, the conditions of contemporary musical production suggest that contextual adaptations of instrumental devices beyond the monolithic unity of classical instruments should be considered. The first two parts of this article analyse various reasons to reassess the issue of longevity and ephemerality. The last two sections attempt to propose an articulation of these two aspects to inform both the design of the DMI and their learning.}

The MRMI probe was experienced by 10 musician participants (mean age: 25.6 years [SD=3.0], 6 females, 4 males). We conducted a user evaluation comprising three stages. After an experimentation period, participants were asked to accompany a pre-recorded piece of music. In a post-task stage, participants took part in semi-structured interviews, which were subjected to thematic analysis. Prevalent themes included reducing the size of the interface, issues with the field of view of the device and physical strain from playing. Participants were largely in favour of hand poses as expressive control, although this depended on customisation and temporal dynamics; the use of interactive machine learning (IML) for user-adaptive hand pose recognition was well received by participants.}

We discuss how these tracked gestures may be connected to concepts and dynamic relationships from embodied cognition, expanding on performative models for pitch and timbre spaces.

The system combines a multichannel audio feed from the guitar (which is parsed for its pitch, spectral content and note inter--onset time data to provide abstractions of sounded performance gestures) with motion tracking of the performer's larger--scale bodily movements using a Microsoft Xbox Kinect sensor. These gestural materials are used to provide the basis for the structures of relational mappings, informed by the embodied image schema structures of Lakoff and Johnson. These theoretical perspectives are refined via larger-scale ecological-embodied structural relationships in electroacoustic music outlined in Smalley's theory of spectromorphology, alongside the incorporation of an additional active-agential response structure through the use of the boids flocking algorithm by Reynolds to control the spatialization of outputs and other textural processes. The paper aims to advance a broadly-applicable 'performance gesture ecology', providing a shared spatial-relational mapping (a 'basic gestural space') which allows for creative (but still coherent) mappings from the performance gestures to the control of textural and spatial structures.}

The use of embodied metaphors within these mappings is seen as a means of managing the complexity of a musical performance across multiple modalities. In particular, we will investigate how these mapping strategies may facilitate the creation of performance systems whose accessibility and richness are enhanced by common integrating bases. A key focus for this work is the investigation of the embodied image schema theories of Lakoff and Johnson alongside similarly embodied metaphorical models within Smalley's influential theory of electroacoustic music (spectromorphology). These metaphors will be investigated for their use as grounding structural components and dynamics for creative practices and musical interaction design.

  abstract = {Composing music typically requires years of music theory experience and knowledge that includes but is not limited to chord progression, melody composition theory, and an understanding of whole-step/half-step passing tones among others. For that reason, certain songwriters such as singers may find a necessity to hire experienced pianists to help compose their music. In order to facilitate the process for beginner and aspiring musicians, we have developed Lumanote, a music composition tool that aids songwriters by presenting real-time suggestions on appropriate melody notes and chord progression. While a preliminary evaluation yielded favorable results for beginners, many commented on the difficulty of having to map the note suggestions displayed on the on-screen interface to the physical keyboard they were playing on. This paper presents the resulting solution: an LED-based feedback system that is designed to be directly attached to any standard MIDI keyboard. This peripheral aims to help map note suggestions directly to the physical keys of a musical keyboard. A study consisting of 22 individuals was conducted to compare the effectiveness of the new LED-based system with the existing computer interface, finding that the vast majority of users preferred the LED system. Three experienced musicians also judged and ranked the compositions, noting significant improvement in song quality when using either system, and citing comparable quality between compositions that used either interface.},

Due to the erratic nature of thesystem and the precondition that image to sound relationships are unfixed, theperformance situation is replete with the discovery of new sounds and thecircumstances that bring them into play. Graphic waveshaping may be understood as non-linear distortion synthesis withtime-varying transfer functions stemming from visual scan lines. As a form ofgraphic synthesis, visual images function as motivations for sound generation.There is a strategy applied for creating one out of the other. However, counterto compositionally oriented forms of graphic synthesis where one may assignimage characteristics to musical parameters such as pitches, durations,dynamics, etc., graphic waveshaping is foremost a processing technique, as itdistorts incoming signals according to graphically derived transfer functions.As such, it may also be understood as an audio effect; one that in myimplementations is particularly feedback dependent, oriented towards shapingthe erratic behavior of synthesis patches written in Max/MSP/Jitter. Used inthis manner, graphic waveshaping elicits an emergent system behaviorconditioned by visual features.},

Drawing on the work of Born, I sketch an outline of the reach of these topics. I suggest that practice-led methods, by dint of focussing on the lived experience where many of these topics converge, may be able to serve as a useful methodological `glue' for NIME by helping stimulate useful agonistic discussion on our objects of study, and map the untidy contours of contemporary practices. I contextualise this discussion by presenting two recently developed improvisation systems and drawing from these some starting suggestions for how attention to the grain of lived practice could usefully contribute to considerations for designers in terms of the pursuit of musicality and the care required in considering performances in evaluation.}

One approach, geared toward real-time control, uses low dimensional gestural controllers and learned mappings from control spaces to parameter spaces, making use of an intermediate latent timbre distribution, such that the control space affords a spatially-intuitive arrangement of sonic possibilities. Whereas many existing systems present alternatives to the traditional parametric interfaces, the proposed system explores ways in which feature-based synthesis can augment one-to-one parameter control, made possible by fully invertible mappings between control and parameter spaces.}

  abstract = {Musical audio synthesis often requires systems-level knowledge and uniquely analytical approaches to music making, thus a number of machine learning systems have been proposed to replace traditional parameter spaces with more intuitive control spaces based on spatial arrangement of sonic qualities. Some prior evaluations of simplified control spaces have shown increased user efficacy via quantitative metrics in sound design tasks, and some indicate that simplification may lower barriers to entry to synthesis. However, the level and nature of the appeal of simplified interfaces to synthesists merits investigation, particularly in relation to the type of task, prior expertise, and aesthetic values. Toward addressing these unknowns, this work investigates user experience in a sample of 20 musicians with varying degrees of synthesis expertise, and uses a one-week, at-home, multi-task evaluation of a novel instrument presenting a simplified mode of control alongside the full parameter space. We find that our participants generally give primacy to parameter space and seek understanding of parameter-sound relationships, yet most do report finding some creative utility in timbre-space control for discovery of sounds, timbral transposition, and expressive modulations of parameters. Although we find some articulations of particular aesthetic values, relationships to user experience remain difficult to characterize generally.}

A flexible matrix printed circuit board (PCB) is fixed on a piano key.

Several calibration and measurement scenarios are shown. The violin sensor was evaluated with 13 music students regarding playability and robustness of the system. Main focus was a the integration of the sensors into these two traditional musical instruments as unobtrusively as possible to keep natural haptic playing sensation. The musicians playing the violin in different performance situations stated good playability and no differences in the haptic sensation while playing. The piano sensor is rated, due to interviews after testing it in a conventional keyboard quite unobtrusive, too, but still evokes a different haptic sensation.},

Data was recorded with different position sensors, a micro camcorder fixed on a violin and an acceleration sensor placed on the bow. Sensor measurements were obtained at a high sampling rate, gathering the data with a small mi-crocontroller unit, connected with a laptop computer. To capture bow's position, rotation and angle directly on the bow to string contact point, the micro camcorder was fixed near the bridge. Main focuses of interest were the changes of the left hand finger, the temporal synchronization between left hand fingers with the right hand, the close up view to the bow to string contact point and the contact of the left hand finger and/or string to the fingerboard. Seven violinists, from beginners to master class students played scales in different rhythms, speeds and bowings and music excerpts of free choice while being recorded. One measure-ment with 2 violinists was made to see the time differences between two musicians while playing together. For simple integration of a conventional violin into electronic music environments, left hand sensor data were exemplary converted to MIDI and OSC.},

One of them is 3D musical drawing, i.e., the ability to draw sonic and visual paths in virtual and physical spaces. However, in existing instruments (controllers, hand tracking) most of the interaction happens in the digital/virtual space which reduces primary audio and haptic feedback and might limit the expressiveness one has with physical drawing and acoustic instruments. In this paper, we propose a novel design approach which moves part of the 3D interaction back to the physical space for more intimate controls and more direct feedback, creating a physical interaction loop connected with the virtual interaction loop. We then present MagneTip, a first implementation of this approach for 3D musical drawing, which enables one or two handed interaction and combines co-localised and spatialised feedback. We believe that our physical interaction loop approach could be applied to other paradigms of 3D musical interaction.}

How the performer executes the gestures to achieve a sound on an instrument, by contrast, appears to be less examined. Previous research showed that auditory imagery, or the ability to hear or recreate sounds in the mind even when no audible sound is present, is essential to the sensorimotor control involved in playing an instrument. In this paper, we enquire whether auditory imagery can also help to support skill transfer between musical instruments resulting in possible implications for new instrument design. To answer this question, we performed two experimental studies on pitch accuracy and fluency where professional violinists were asked to play a modified violin. Results showed altered or even possibly irrelevant auditory feedback on a modified violin does not appear to be a significant impediment to performance. However, performers need to have coherent imagery of what they want to do, and the sonic outcome needs to be coupled to the motor program to achieve it. This finding shows that the design lens should be shifted from a direct feedback model of instrumental playing toward a model where imagery guides the playing process. This result is in agreement with recent research on skilled sensorimotor control that highlights the value of feedforward anticipation in embodied musical performance. It is also of primary importance for the design of new instruments: new sounds that cannot easily be imagined and that are not coupled to a motor program are not likely to be easily performed on the instrument.}

In our study, twelve professional electric guitar players used an augmented plectrum to replicate prerecorded timbre variations in a set of musical excerpts. The task was undertaken in two experimental conditions: a reference condition, and a subtle gradual change in the sensitivity of the augmented plectrum which is designed to affect the guitarist's performance without making them consciously aware of its effect. We propose that players' subconscious response to the disruption of changing the sensitivity, as well as their overall ability to replicate the stimuli, may indicate the strength of the relationship they developed with the new interface. The case study presented in this paper highlights the strengths and limitations of this method.}

It translates the gestures of a performer to the standard communication protocol ofMIDI, allowing for flexible mappings of performance data to sonic parameters. When used in conjunction with a realtime signal processing environment, the Accordiatron becomes an expressive, versatile musical instrument. A combination of sensory outputs providing both discrete and continuous data gives the subtle expressiveness and control necessary for interactive music.},

  abstract = {This paper situates NIME practice with respect to models of social interaction among human agents. It argues that the conventional model of composer-performer-listener, and the underlying mid-20th century metaphor of music as communication upon which it relies, cannot reflect the richness of interaction and possibility afforded by interactive digital technologies. Building on Paul Lansky's vision of an expanded and dynamic social network, an alternative, ecological view of music-making is presented, in which meaning emerges not from "messages" communicated between individuals, but instead from the "noise" that arises through the uncertainty in their interactions. However, in our tendency in NIME to collapse the various roles in this network into a single individual, we place the increased potential afforded by digital systems at risk. Using examples from the author's NIME practices, the paper uses a practice-based methodology to describe approaches to designing instruments that respond to the technologies that form the interfaces of the network, which can include scores and stylistic conventions. In doing so, the paper demonstrates that a repertoire\&\#8212;a seemingly anachronistic concept\&\#8212;and a corresponding repertoire-driven approach to creating NIMEs can in fact be a catalyst for invention and creativity.}

In line with the methodological principles of practice as research, we describe the development and design of one such instrument-Stringtrees. The design process also reflects the notion of ambiguity as a resource in design: The instrument was endowed with a collection of sensors, controls, and actuators without a highly specific or prescriptive model for how a musician would interact with it.}

An ecological perspective on several approaches to musical creation with interactive technologies reveals an expanded, more inclusive view of artistic interaction that facilitates novel, compelling ways to use technology for music. This paper is fundamentally a call to consider the role of aesthetic values in the analysis of artistic processes and technologies.},

This time interval may include one or more touches. The problem is complicated by the fact that the mechanical interaction between the arm and piano action generates additional movements that are not under direct control of the player.

We propose a concept that hybridizes physical computing and TUI toolkit approaches. This helps to tackle typical TUI toolkit weaknesses, namely quick sensor obsolescence and limited choices. We developed a physical realization based on the idea of "universal pins", which can be configured to perform a variety of duties, making it possible to connect different sensor breakouts and modules.

The project was conducted by both the students of the music therapy and multimedia composition programs and has thus offered rare insights into the dynamic of such undertakings covering both the therapeutic underpinnings, as well as the technical means required to achieve a particular result. DJster, the engine we used for the generative processes is based on Clarence Barlow's probabilistic algorithms. Equipped with the proper periphery (sensors, sound modules and spatializers), we looked at three different scenarios, each requiring specific musical and technological solutions. The pilot was concluded by a symposium in 2017 and the development of a prototype system. The symposium yielded a diagram detailing the circular dynamic of the factors involved in this particular project, while the prototype was demoed in 2016 at the HfMT facilities.

The novelty of the proposed method lies in the fact that the system is not reliant on a voice-by-voice transcription of drums; instead, in this method, a drum representation is used as an input sequence from which a translated bassline is obtained at the output. The drum representation consists of fixed size sequences of onsets detected from a 2-bar audio drum loop in eight different frequency bands. The basslines generated by this method consist of pitched notes with different duration. The proposed system was trained on two distinct datasets compiled for this project by the authors. Each dataset contains a variety of 2-bar drum loops with annotated basslines from two different styles of dance music: House and Soca. A listening experiment designed based on the system revealed that the proposed system is capable of generating basslines that are interesting and are well rhythmically interlocked with the drum loops from which they were generated.}

Similarly, AI-based drum generation tools can focus on creating human-like drum patterns, or alternatively, focus on providing producers/musicians with means of experimentation with rhythm. In this work, we aimed to explore the latter approach. To this end, we present a suite of Transformer-based models aimed at completing audio drum loops with stylistically consistent symbolic drum events. Our proposed models rely on a reduced spectral representation of the drum loop, striking a balance between a raw audio recording and an exact symbolic transcription. Using a number of objective evaluations, we explore the validity of our approach and identify several challenges that need to be further studied in future iterations of this work. Lastly, we provide a real-time VST plugin that allows musicians/producers to utilize the models in real-time production settings.}

  abstract = {This paper describes the design and creation of an electronically augmented replica of a historical harpsichord keyboard with a typical 17th-century Italian layout to create a digital musical instrument. The keyboard was commissioned for exhibition in a musical instrument museum to enhance the visitor experience by providing an interface to digitised versions of instruments within the collection. The replica balances the competing demands of historical authenticity, public accessibility, and preservation. It replicates the original instrument's tactile feedback and mechanical resistance using historically informed construction techniques. Optical sensors integrated within the mechanism capture the jacks' motion data, enabling MIDI message generation. This work situates itself within broader discussions on the role of technology in museums. A keyboard interface of this type offers an opportunity to enhance visitor interaction with musical heritage while safeguarding delicate artefacts. The paper examines the keyboard's design principles, technical implementation, and implications, emphasising its contribution to public engagement and the long-term preservation of musical heritage.}

Real-time alignment allows the system to evaluate whether the user played the correct note or not, regardless of its timing, which enables user to play at their own speed, as playing same tempo with original musical score is problematic for beginners. As an output of evaluation, the system notifies the user about which part they are currently performing, and which note were played incorrectly.},

In this research, we propose a novel interactive musical instrument called ParaSampling that utilizes the technology of magnetic sound recording, and a improvisational sound playing method based on the instrument. While a conventional cassette tape player has a single tapehead, which rigidly placed, our instrument utilizes multiple handheld tapehead modules as an interface. Players can hold the interfaces and press them against the rotating magnetic tape at an any point to record or reproduce sounds The player can also easily erase and rewrite the sound recorded on the tape. With this instrument, they can achieve improvised and unique musical expressions through tangible and spatial interactions. In this paper, we describe the system design of ParaSampling, the implementation of the prototype system, and discuss music expressions enabled by the system.}

The objective behind the design of the game application was to support players in some aspects of their mutual play. Results show that even though players activated additional sound feedback as a result of their mutual play, players also engaged in forms of mutual play that the game engine did not account for. These ways of mutual play are descibed further along with some suggestions for how to direct future designs of collaborative music improvisation games towards ways of mutual play.},

The sound systems adapted to how a team of two players improvised and made a melody together in an interleaved fashion: Systems A and B used a fuzzy logic algorithm and pattern recognition to respond with modifications of a background rhythms. In an experiment with a pen tablet interface as the music instrument, users aged 10-13 were to tap tones and continue each other's melody. The sound systems rewarded users sonically, if they managed to add tones to their mutual melody in a rapid turn taking manner with rhythmical patterns. Videos of experiment sessions show that user teams contributed to a melody in ways that resemble conversation. Interaction data show that each sound system made player teams play in different ways, but players in general had a hard time adjusting to a non-Western music tradition. The paper concludes with a comparison and evaluation of the two sound systems. Finally it proposes a new approach to the design of collaborative and shared music environments that is based on ''listening applications''.},

It extends ChucK by providing a framework for symbolic music representation, playback, and manipulation. SMucK introduces classes for scores, parts, measures, and notes; the latter encode musical information such as pitch, rhythm, and dynamics. These data structures allow users to organize musical information sequentially and hierarchically in ways that reflect familiar conventions of Western music notation. SMucK supports data interchange with formats like MusicXML and MIDI, enabling users to import notated scores and performance data into SMucK data structures. SMucK also introduces SMucKish, a compact high-level input syntax, designed to be efficient, human-readable, and live-codeable. The SMucK playback system extends ChucK's strongly-timed mechanism with dynamic temporal control over real-time audio synthesis and other systems including graphics and interaction. Taken as a whole, SMucK's design philosophy treats symbolic music data not only as static representations but also as mutable, recombinant building blocks for algorithmic and interactive processing. By integrating symbolic music into a strongly-timed, concurrent programming language, SMucK's workflow goes beyond data representation and playback, and opens new possibilities for algorithmic composition, instrument design, and musical performance.}

In many of these applications however, the model is often used to render the high dimensional output directly e.g. every individual pixel in the final image. Humans arguably operate in much lower dimensional spaces during the creative process e.g. the broad movements of a brush. In this paper, we design a neural gesture system for music generation based around this concept. Instead of directly generating audio, we train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to generate instantaneous position and pressure on the Roli Lightpad instrument. These generated coordinates in turn, give rise to the sonic output defined in the synth engine. The system relies on learning these movements from a musician who has already developed a palette of musical gestures idiomatic to the Lightpad. Unlike many deep learning systems that render high dimensional output, our low-dimensional system can be run in real-time, enabling the first real time gestural duet of its kind between a player and a recurrent neural network on the Lightpad instrument.},

The method is based on an array of optical distance sensors in combination with a regression machine learning model to predict the position at and the amount by which each cord is displaced from a baseline tensioned position. Capacitive strips on the back of the neck of the instrument afford additional timbral control. A preliminary user study suggests that performers find the system responsive and engaging to play, while highlighting the need to further improve the accuracy of the regression model to make the system more intuitive.}

Can a contrived environment envelope the senses to the point that one feel fully immersed in it? It was with these questions in mind that the interactive mechanical sound art installation endo/exo came into being. Through the use of networked technology the system becomes more like a self-aware organism, passing messages from node to node as cells communicate through chemical signals with their neighbors. In an artistic context, the communication network resembles, but differs from, other mechanical systems. Issues such as latency are often considered negative factors, yet they can contribute a touch of personality in this context. This paper is a reflection on these and other considerations gained from the experience of designing and constructing endo/exo as well as future implications for the Honeycomb platform as a tool for creating musical interactions within a new paradigm which allows for emergent behavior across vast physical spaces. The use of swarming and self-organization, as well as playful interaction, creates an ``aliveness'' in the mechanism, and renders its exploration pleasurable, intriguing and uncanny.}

Over the last year we been developing a hardware and software toolkit for music called modular-muse. Here we describe the design and goals for these tools and how they have been used in different settings to introduce children to concepts of interaction design for music and sound design. Two exploratory studies which used modular-muse are described here with different approaches; a two day build your own instrument workshop where participants learned how to use both hardware and software concurrently to control synthesized sounds and trigger solenoids, and a middle school music classroom where the focus was only on programming for sound synthesis using the modular-muse Pd library. During the second study, a project called Pd Poems, a teaching progression emerged we call Build-Play-Share-Focus which is also described.}

For these criteria the pedal steel guitar proved an apt model as it allows control over several instrument parameters simultaneously and continuously. The parameters we wanted control over were volume, timbre, release time and pitch.The Quadrofeelia is played with two hands on a horizontal surface. Single notes and melodies are easily played as well as chordal accompaniment with a variety of timbres and release times enabling a range of legato and staccato notes in an intuitive manner with a new yet familiar interface.},

As we have come to know them drum machines provide means to loop rhythmic patterns over a certain interval. Usually with the option to specify different beat divisions. What I developed and propose for consideration is a rethinking of the traditional drum machine confines. The Sinkapater is an untethered beat sequencer in that the beat division, and the loop length can be arbitrarily modified for each track. The result is the capability to create complex syncopated patterns which evolve over time as different tracks follow their own loop rate. To keep cohesion all channels can be locked to a master channel forcing a loop to be an integer number of "Master Beats". Further a visualization mode enables exploring the patterns in another new way. Using synchronized OpenGL a 3-Dimensional environment visualizes the beats as droplets falling from faucets of varying heights determined by the loop length. Waves form in the bottom as beats splash into the virtual "sink". By combining compelling visuals and a new approach to sequencing a new way of exploring beats and experiencing music has been created.},

We designed an actuated fretting mechanism to replace the role of the fretting hand in order to preserve plucking hand techniques. We then conducted a performance study in which experienced bassists prepared and performed an accompaniment to a backing track with the adapted bass. The performances highlighted ways in which adapting a fretted string instrument in this way impacts plucking hand technique.}

Conversely, digital musical instruments (DMIs), being unconstrained by requirements of efficient acoustic sound production and ergonomics, can take on forms which are more abstract in their relation to the mechanism of control and sound production. In this paper we consider the case of designing DMIs for use in existing musical cultures, and pose questions around the social and technical acceptability of certain design choices relating to global physical form and input modality (sensing strategy and the input gestures that it affords). We designed four guitar-derivative DMIs designed to be suitable to perform a strummed harmonic accompaniment to a folk tune. Each instrument possessed varying degrees of `guitar-likeness', based either on the form and aesthetics of the guitar or the specific mode of interaction. We conducted a study where both non-musicians and guitarists played two versions of the instruments and completed musical tasks with each instrument. The results of this study highlight the complex interaction between global form and input modality when designing for existing musical cultures.},

The laser beams, which are made visible by a thin layer of theatrical mist, provide visual feedback and guidance to the performer to alleviate the difficulties of using a non-contact interface as well as adding an interesting component for the audience to observe. The system uses capacitive sensing to detect the proximity of the player's hands; this distance is mapped to pitch, volume, or other continuous effect. The laser guide positions are calibrated before play with position controlled servo motors interfaced to a main controller board; the location of each beam corresponds to the position where the performer should move his or her hand to achieve a pre-specified pitch and/or effect. The optical system senses the distance of the player's hands from the source of each laser beam, providing an additional dimension of musical control.},

Some artists who introduce automated music performance operate parameters of the sound in their performance for production of their music. In this paper, we focus on the music production aspects and describe a method that realizes operation of the sound parameters via computer. Further, in this study, the probability distribution of the action (i.e., variation of parameters) is obtained within the music, using Bayesian filters. The probability distribution of each piece of music is transformed by passing through a Markov model. After the probability distribution is obtained, sound parameters can be automatically controlled. We have developed a system to reproduce the musical expressions of humans and confirmed the possibilities of our method.}

These characteristics allow for the easy implementation of varying approaches to collaborative performance. Ensembles who utilize digital musical instruments provide a fertile environment for the design, testing, and utilization of collaborative performance systems. The three strategies discussed in this paper are the parameterization of musical elements, turn-based collaborative control of sound, and the interaction of musical systems created by multiple performers. Design principles, implementation, and a performance using these strategies are discussed, and the conclusion is drawn that performer interaction and collaboration as a primary focus for system design, composition, and performance is viable.},

In order to assist in the consideration of the complete set of design specifications, we identify seven aspects of hardware design relevant to our applications: function, aesthetics, support for artistic creation, system architecture, manufacturing, robustness, and reusability. Examples drawn from our previous work are used to illustrate the characteristics of interdependency and temporality, and form the basis of case studies investigating support for artistic creation and reusability. We argue that the consideration of these design aspects at appropriate times within the development process may facilitate the ability of hardware systems to support continued use in professional applications.}

By using only the real-time audio signalfrom live performer/s as an input the causal relationshipbetween acoustic performance gestures and computer output, including any visual or performer-instruction output,is deterministic even if the chaotic behaviours are not.},

  abstract = {The carillon is one of the few instruments that elicit sophisticated haptic interaction from amateur and professional players alike. Like the piano keyboard, the velocity of a player's impact on each carillon key, or baton, affects the quality of the resultant tone; unlike the piano, each carillon baton returns a different forcefeedback. Force-feedback varies widely from one baton to the next across the entire range of the instrument and with further idiosyncratic variation from one instrument to another. This makes the carillon an ideal candidate for haptic simulation. The application of synthesized forcefeedback based on an analysis of forces operating in a typical carillon mechanism offers a blueprint for the design of an electronic practice clavier and with it the solution to a problem that has vexed carillonists for centuries, namely the inability to rehearse repertoire in private. This paper will focus on design and implementation of a haptic carillon clavier derived from an analysis of the Australian National Carillon in Canberra.},

This suggests that musical worlds coevolve with their agents through repeated sensorimotor interactions with the environment (where the music is being created), and at the same time cannot be separated from their sociocultural contexts. This paper investigates this claim by exploring ways in which technology, physiology, and context are bound up within two different musical scenarios: live electronic musical performance; and person-centred arts applications of NIMEs. In this paper I outline an ethnographic and phenomenological enquiry into my experiences as both a performer of live electronic and electro-instrumental music, as well as my extensive background in working with new technologies in various therapeutic and person-centred artistic situations. This is in order to explore the sociocultural and technological contexts in which these activities take place. I propose that by understanding creative musical participation as a highly contextualised practice, we may discover that the greatest impact of rapidly developing technological resources is their ability to afford richly diverse, personalised, and embodied forms of music making. I argue that this is applicable over a wide range of musical communities.}

While this origin story is often noted, the implications of NIME's history as emerging from a field predominantly dealing with human-computer interaction have rarely been discussed. In this paper we highlight many of the recent---and some not so recent---challenges that have been brought upon the NIME community as it attempts to maintain and expand its identity as a platform for multidisciplinary research into HCI, interface design, and electronic and computer music. We discuss the relationship between the market demands of the neoliberal university---which have underpinned academia's drive for innovation---and the quantification and economisation of research performance which have facilitated certain disciplinary and social frictions to emerge within NIME-related research and practice. Drawing on work that engages with feminist theory and cultural studies, we suggest that critical reflection and moreover mediation is necessary in order to address burgeoning concerns which have been raised within the NIME discourse in relation to methodological approaches,'diversity and inclusion', 'accessibility', and the fostering of rigorous interdisciplinary research.}

Taking this multidimensionality as its point of departure, the Tuning Vine interface assigns a unique angle and colour to each prime number, along with aligning melodic pitch height to vertical height on the computer screen. These features allow direct and intuitive interaction with Just Intonation. The inclusion of a transposition function along each prime number axis also enables potentially unlimited exploration of harmonic space within prime limit 23. Currently available as desktop software, a prototype for a hardware version has also been constructed, and future tablet app and hardware versions of the Tuning Vine are planned that will allow tangible as well as audiovisual interaction with microtonal harmonic space.}

For instance, how does one compose for a non-linear, indeterminate experience using linear pre-composed placed sounds, where fixed musical time is situated into the indeterminate time of the user's experience? Furthermore, how does one create a soundtrack that is suitable for the location, but also functions as a coherent musical structure? We explore these questions by analyzing an existing `placed sound' work from a traditional music theory perspective and in doing so reveal some structural principals from `fixed' musical forms can also support the composition of contemporary locative music experiences.}

  abstract = {Music plays a vital role in accompanying all manner of our experiences. Soundtracks within films, video games and ceremonies possess a unique ability to enhance a narrative, suggest emotional content and mark key transitions. Moreover, soundtracks often achieve all of this without being the primary focus, on the contrary they typically assume a supporting role. The proliferation of mobile devices increasingly leads us to listen to music while on the move and musicians are seizing on locative technologies as a tool for creating new kinds of music that directly respond to people's movements through space. In light of these trends, we consider the interesting question of how composers might set about creating musical soundtracks to accompany mobile experiences. What we have in mind are experiences such as guided walks, tours and even pervasive games. The novelty of our research here is in the music serving as an accompaniment to enhance a location specific activity, much as a soundtrack does for a film. This calls for composers to take into account the key features of the experience, and its setting, to gently complement them through the music. We examine this process from a composer's perspective by presenting `from the field' an account of how they address the multifaceted challenges of designing a soundtrack for public sculpture park. We chart a composer's rationale as they developed a soundtrack for this site over multiple iterations of design, testing and refinement. We expose key relationships between the raw materials of music (melody, harmony, timbre, rhythm and dynamics) and those of the physical setting, that enable the composer to gracefully mesh the music into the fabric of the space. The result is to propose a set of recommendations to inform the composition of mobile soundtracks that we intend to guide future practice and research.}

The underlying purpose of our system is to move the player's focus away from complexities of the modern urban world toward a more internalized meditative state.

Since the flute does not have a reed to resonate, the player must provide a steady, focused stream of air that will cause the flute to resonate and thereby produce sound. In order to achieve this, the player has to be aware of the embouchure position to generate an adequate air jet. For a beginner, this can be a difficult task due to the lack of visual cues or indicators of the air jet and lips position. This paper attempts to address this problem by presenting an augmented flute that can make the gestures related to the embouchure visible and measurable. The augmented flute shows information about the area covered by the lower lip, estimates the lip hole shape based on noise analysis, and it shows graphically the air jet direction. Additionally, the augmented flute provides directional and continuous feedback in real time, based on data acquired by experienced flutists.}

The body as a vector associated with sound, gesture, video, physical space, and technological space, constitute the six founding elements. They give rise to works between music and dance, between musical theater and multimedia works leading to a new hybrid performative practice. These works are realized using a motion capture system by computer vision, SICMAP (Syst\'eme Interactif de Captation du Mouvement en Art Performatif --- Interactive Motion Capture System For The Performative Arts). In this paper, the author situates her artistic practice founded by the three pillars of transdisciplinary research methodology. The path taken by the performer-creator, leading to the conception of the SICMAP, is then explained through a reflection on the `dream instrument'. Followed by a technical description, the SICMAP is contextualized using theoretical models: the instrumental continuum and energy continuum, the `dream instrument' and the typology of the instrumental gesture. Initiated by the SICMAP, these are then applied to a new paradigm the gesture-sound space and subsequently put into practice through the creation of the work From Infinity To Within.},

  abstract = {In the recent years, mechatronic musical instruments (MMI) have become increasingly parametrically rich. Researchers have developed different interaction strategies to negotiate the challenge of interfacing with each of the MMI's high-resolution parameters in real time. While mapping strategies hold an important aspect of the musical interaction paradigm for MMI, attention on dedicated input devices to perform these instruments live should not be neglected. This paper presents the findings of a user study conducted with participants possessing specialized musicianship skills for MMI music performance and composition. Study participants are given three musical tasks to complete using a mechatronic chordophone with high dimensionality of control via different musical input interfaces (one input device at a time). This representative user study reveals the features of related-dedicated input controllers, how they compare against the typical MIDI keyboard/sequencer paradigm in human-MMI interaction, and provide an indication of the musical function that expert users prefer for each input interface.}

The primary goal of UMD is to create experiential, educational pathways for the DHH to interact with music in a meaningful way. GeLu is the first UMD interface in the framework and is modular in its feature set allowing the user to choose, based on use case, between visual and/or haptic feedback along with gestural sensing. GeLu combines two bracelets: a ring system with gesture sensing and haptic feedback; and an audio-reactive LED color feedback array. The ring system captures tactile input through sensors and provides haptic feedback on the fingertips. The audio-reactive LED color feedback bracelet visualizes audio data, creating dynamic visualizations synchronized with sound.}

IMFT occurs when an instrumentalist is patched into a mixing board with feedback loops (a.k.a no-input mixer). The instrumentalist interacts and influences the mixer's feedback together with another performer operating the mixer. Introducing an instrument into the no-input mixer's previously closed system creates possibilities for new collaborative interactions between humans and chaotic feedback systems. In this system, a chaotic, out-of-control relationship can be formed where the output of the mixer and the gestures from the mixer performer can be in battle with the input from the instrumentalist and vice-versa.After a brief historical contextualization of mixer feedback, the IMFT system and the complex relationships that form between human and machine are introduced. No-input mixer performance practices are discussed, followed by exploration of a single feedback loop to illustrate some of the mixer's possible sound worlds and the nature of the instrument. Performance experiences from two recent compositions by the first author, generative open graphic score \#1 (2023) and noise ritual (2023), are described in order to explore different performance interactions created by different instrumentalists working with the IMFT system. This practice-based research provides a useful case study examining the entangled relationship between performers and interfaces in feedback-based music systems and how innovative approaches to an established electronic practice can create new perspectives and collaborative opportunities.}

The more computers involved the longer the setup and tear-down of a performance. Each computer adds power and cabling requirements that the venue must accommodate. Cloud computing can change of all this by simplifying the setup of many (10s, 100s) of machines at the click of a button. But there's a catch, the cloud is not physically near you, you cannot run an audio cable to the cloud. The audio from a computer music instrument in the cloud needs to streamed back to the performer and listeners. There are many solutions for streaming audio over networks and the internet, most of them suffer from high latency, heavy buffering, or proprietary/non-portable clients. In this paper we propose a portable cloud-friendly method of streaming, almost a cloud soundcard, whereby performers can use mobile devices (Android, iOS, laptops) to stream audio from the cloud with far lower latency than technologies like icecast. This technology enables near-realtime control over power computer music networks enabling performers to travel light and perform live with more computers than ever before.}

Yet many modern NIMEs could be hacked from smart-phones in the audience. The lack of security hardening makes NIMEs an easy target --- but a question arises: if hacking can interrupt or modify a performance couldn't hacking itself also be performance? Thus would music hacking, live-hacking, be similar to live-coding? In this paper we discuss how NIMEs are in danger of being hacked, and yet how hacking can be an act of performance too.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing potentially ushers in a new era of computer music performance with exceptionally large computer music instruments consisting of 10s to 100s of virtual machines which we propose to call a `cloud-orchestra'. Cloud computing allows for the rapid provisioning of resources, but to deploy such a complicated and interconnected network of software synthesizers in the cloud requires a lot of manual work, system administration knowledge, and developer/operator skills. This is a barrier to computer musicians whose goal is to produce and perform music, and not to administer 100s of computers. This work discusses the issues facing cloud-orchestra deployment and offers an abstract solution and a concrete implementation. The abstract solution is to generate cloud-orchestra deployment plans by allowing computer musicians to model their network of synthesizers and to describe their resources. A model optimizer will compute near-optimal deployment plans to synchronize, deploy, and orchestrate the start-up of a complex network of synthesizers deployed to many computers. This model driven development approach frees computer musicians from much of the hassle of deployment and allocation. Computer musicians can focus on the configuration of musical components and leave the resource allocation up to the modelling software to optimize.}

A didgeridoo is played by buzzing the lips and blowing air into the didgeridoo. To play a didgeridoo continously one can employ circular breathing but the volume of air required poses a real challenge to novice players. In this paper we replace the expense of circular breathing and lip buzzing with electronic excitation, thus creating an electro-acoustic didgeridoo or electronic didgeridoo. Thus we describe the didgeridoo excitation signal, how to replicate it, and the hardware necessary to make an electro-acoustic didgeridoo driven by speakers and controllable from a computer. To properly drive the didgeridoo we rely upon 4th-order ported bandpass speaker boxes to help guide our excitation signals into an attached acoustic didgeridoo. The results somewhat replicate human didgeridoo playing, enabling a new kind of mid to low electro-acoustic accompaniment without the need for circular breathing.}

This virtual keyboard is highly customizable: users can freely program the number of keys and their respective pitches. Modern software instruments offer advanced capabilities, including microtonal scales (pitches outside the standard 12-tone equal temperament). However, playing these instruments often remains challenging due to the lack of corresponding physical hardware. Our proposed solution addresses this gap by projecting a programmable virtual keyboard onto a tangible object within the XR space. This approach combines the software's flexibility with the tactile feedback of a physical surface, enhancing playability. Users can simplify the keyboard layout (e.g., fewer keys than a piano) or expand it beyond conventional limits to explore new expressive possibilities, particularly for microtonal music. We conducted a small pilot study (N=4) involving participants mostly inexperienced with keyboards to gather preliminary feedback on the interface's ease of use for performance.}

Similarly, the instrument designer, composer, and performer are often the same person. The Academic Festival Overture is a new piece of music for the DMI Trombosonic and symphonic orchestra written by a composer who had no prior experience with the instrument. The piece underwent the phases of a composition competition, rehearsals, a music video production, and a public live performance. This whole process was evaluated reflecting on the experience of three involved key stakeholder: the composer, the conductor, and the instrument designer as performer. `Blending dimensions' of these stakeholder and decoupling the composition from the instrument designer inspired the newly involved composer to completely rethink the DMI's interaction and sound concept. Thus, to deliberately avoid an early collaboration between a DMI designer and a composer bears the potential for new inspiration and at the same time the challenge to seek such a collaboration in the need of clarifying possible misunderstandings and improvement.}

Strain gauge sensors on saxophone and clarinet reeds have been shown to be a useful tool to gain insight into tongue articulation during performance but also capture the reed vibrations. In our previous design, we used a procedure with epoxy adhesive to glue the strain gauge sensors to the flat side of the synthetic single reeds. The new design integrates the sensor inside a synthetic reed, respectively between layers of fibre polymer and wood. This allows an industrial production of sensor reeds. Sensor reeds open up new possibilities to pick up woodwind instruments and to analyse, to modify, and to amplify the signal. A signal-to-noise analysis of the signals from both designs showed that a sensor, glued to the outside of the reed, produced a cleaner signal.},

Part of the Women's Labor feminist project that creates Embedded Acoustic Instruments using old domestic tools, RRR is anchored by a base that acts as resonator for the system and includes sensors---potentiometers (rheostats) and a rotary encoder---embedded into its physical architecture. RRR detects the weight of hanging clothes and velocity of rotation by hand or wind. Motivated by the feminist concept of reproductive commons, we invite the public to do and witness communal housework in interactive installation and musical performance, in order to challenge gender inequality in domestic work division. A composition written for RRR, A Body of Resistance, draws upon quotes by rheostat inventor Mary Hallock-Greenewalt to address women's struggles for equal treatment. The sound designs for RRR and A Body of Resistance take inspiration from the drying rack's original wind-powered utility, using aerophone sounds and vibrational modelling of pipes and bars. By reimagining domestic tools with embedded technologies, we envision a musical housework commons that can act as a catalyst for social change.}

We find reenactment complementary to conservation, maintenance, reconstruction and emulation in working with archival and museum objects. Our paper presents an analytic framework developed for use in workshop scenarios. This series of questions helps determine and understand which aspects of an instrument might be reenacted. To illustrate the process in action, we describe an example workshop wherein participants use methods of media archaeology, design fiction and role playing to imagine and reenact new features, affordances, contexts and applications of electronic instruments from a museum exhibition.}

The technique requires only passive components and can be used to enhance the touch sensitivity of many everyday objects and even biological materials and substances such as plants, which this paper will focus on as a case study through the project known as Cultivating Frequencies. This paper will discuss different techniques of filtering data captured by this system, different methods for creating gesture recognition unique to the object being used, and the implications of this technology as it pertains to the goal of ubiquitous sensing.

Stringesthesia was designed to explore the connection between performer and audience by using real-time neuroimaging technology that gave the audience direct access to the performer's internal mental state and determined the extent of how the audience could participate with the performer throughout the performance. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technology was used to assess metabolic activity in a network of brain areas collectively associated with a metric we call ``trust''. The real-time measurement of the performer's level of trust was visualized behind the performer and used to dynamically restrict or promote audience participation: e.g., as the performer's trust in the audience grew, more participatory stations for playing drums and selecting the performer's chords were activated. Throughout the paper we discuss prior work that heavily influenced our design, conceptual and methodological issues with using fNIRS technology, and our system architecture. We then describe an employment of this paradigm with a solo guitar player.}

Providing one set of answers to these two questions, the authors create an eye-controlled composition, EyeMusic v1.0, which was selected by juries for live performance at computer music conferences.},

  abstract = {Although new sensor devices and data streams are increasingly used for musical expression, and although eye-tracking devices have become increasingly cost-effective and prevalent in research and as a means of communication for people with severe motor impairments, eye-controlled musical expression nonetheless remains somewhat elusive and minimally explored. This paper (a) identifies a number of fundamental human eye movement capabilities and constraints which determine in part what can and cannot be musically expressed with eye movements, (b) reviews prior work on eye-controlled musical expression, and (c) analyzes and provides a taxonomy of what has been done, and what will need to be addressed in future eye-controlled musical instruments. The fundamental human constraints and processes that govern eye movements create a challenge for eye-controlled music in that the instrument needs to be designed to motivate or at least permit specific unique visual goals, each of which when accomplished must then be mapped, using the eye tracker and some sort of sound generator, to different musical outcomes. The control of the musical instrument is less direct than if it were played with muscles that can be controlled in a more direct manner, such as the muscles in the hands.}

The first one, called The Counterpointer, takes a melody input from the user and responds by generating voices based on the rules of eighteenth--century counterpoint. The second one is based on a recent treatise on harmony and counterpoint by music theorist Dmitri Tymoczco: El Ordenador lets users explore a set of features of tonality by constraining randomly generated music according to one or more of them. El Ordenador gives the user less control than The Counterpointer, but more than La Mec\'anica, the third sequencer in the series. La Mec\'anica plays back the sequences generated by El Ordenador using a punch-card reading music box mechanism. It makes the digital patterns visible and tactile, and links them back to the physical world.}

The modal parameters describe the linear response of a virtual vibrating solid, which is played as a musical instrument by a separate interface. The system uses a three layer feedforward backpropagation neural network which is trained by a discrete set of input-output examples. After training, the network extends the training set, which functions as the specification by example of the controller, to a continuous mapping allowing the real-time morphing of synthetic sound models. We have implemented a prototype application using a controller which collects data from a hand-drawn digital picture. The virtual instrument consists of a bank of modal resonators whose frequencies, dampings, and gains are the parameters we control. We train the system by providing pictorial representations of physical objects such as a bell or a lamp, and associate high quality modal models obtained from measurements on real objects with these inputs. After training, the user can draw pictures interactively and ``play'' modal models which provide interesting (though unrealistic) interpolations of the models from the training set in real-time.}

Instead of aiming for virtuosic perfection of playing the instrument, SlowQin emphasizes the openness for continuously rethinking and reinventing the Guqin's possibilities. Through a combination of conceptual work and practical production, Echo Ho's SlowQin project works as an experimental twist on Historically Informed Performance, with the motivation of conveying artistic gestures that tackle philosophical, ideological, and socio-political subjects embedded in our living environment in globalised conditions. In particular, this paper touches the history of the Guqin, gives an overview of the technical design concepts of the instrument, and discusses the aesthetical approaches of the SlowQin performances that have been realised so far.}

These scripts result in performances where thetechnology enforces the artist and their music to stay in synchronisation withthe pre-programmed environment. We argue that these limitations can be overcomebased on emerging non-invasive tracking technologies in combination with anadvanced gesture recognition engine.We present a solution that uses explicit gestures and implicit dance moves tocontrol the visual augmentation of a live music performance. We furtherillustrate how our framework overcomes existing limitations of gestureclassification systems by delivering a precise recognition solution based on asingle gesture sample in combination with expert knowledge. The presentedsolution enables a more dynamic and spontaneous performance and, when combinedwith indirect augmented reality, results in a more intense interaction betweenthe artist and their audience.},

Experio allows for multiple audience participants influencing the musical performance through dance, facilitated by a musical moderator using a tailored interface.

Cymatic virtual instruments are set up via a graphical user interface in a manner that is highly intuitive. Users design and play these virtual instruments by interacting directly with their physical shape and structure in terms of the physical properties of basic objects such as strings, membranes and solids which can be interconnected to form complex structures. The virtual instrument can be excited at any point mass by the following: bowing, plucking, striking, sine/square/sawtooth/random waveform, or an external sound source. Virtual microphones can be placed at any point masses to deliver the acoustic output. This paper describes the underlying structure and principles upon which Cymatic is based, and illustrates its acoustic output.},

We capture each saxophone gesture on the fly, extract a set of gestural and timbral contours, and store them in a repository. Improvising agents can consult the repository when generating responses. The gestural or timbral progression of a saxophone phrase can be remapped or transformed; this enables a variety of response material that also references audible contours of the original saxophone gestures. A single simple framework is used to manage gestural and timbral information extracted from analysis, and for expressive control of virtual instruments in a free improvisation context.},

By integrating control mechanisms for graphics inside VCV Rack, the music-making metaphors used to build a patch are extended into the visual domain. Users familiar with modular synthesizers are immediately able to start building high-fidelity graphics using the same control voltages regularly used to compose sound. Without needing to interact with two separate development environments, languages or metaphorical domains, users are encouraged to freely, creatively and enjoyably construct their own highly-integrated audio-visual instruments. This demonstration will showcase the construction of an audio-visual patch using URack, focusing on the integration of flexible GPU particle systems present in Unity with the vast library of creative audio composition modules inside VCV.}

Recognising the barriers posed by traditional digital musical instruments, including steep learning curves, high costs, and uninspiring outputs, Harmonix prioritises affordability, portability, and user-friendly interfaces to cater to individuals with no prior musical training. The study evaluates two instruments, ZenithChimes and Equilibrio. ZenithChimes employs touch-sensitive keys mapped to meditative tones in the Aeolian mode, promoting creativity and relaxation. Equilibrio, a 3D-printed "stone stack," uses tilt gestures to modulate soundscapes, symbolising balance and harmony. Both instruments integrate calming auditory outputs and minimalist design aesthetics to create an engaging and meditative experience. A workshop-based study with 10 participants, spanning diverse backgrounds, demonstrated the instruments' accessibility and therapeutic potential. Results showed that participants found the instruments easy to use, aesthetically appealing, and suitable for mindfulness practices, with 70 percent identifying their integration into meditation or yoga sessions as beneficial. However, feedback highlighted the need for more customisation options, particularly in Equilibrio's soundscapes. By bridging art, technology, and mindfulness, Harmonix fosters creative exploration and emotional regulation, with implications for therapeutic, educational, and artistic applications. Future work will explore sustainability, inclusivity, and multi-sensory feedback to enhance the instruments' design and impact. This study underscores the potential of ADMIs to transcend conventional music-making, offering innovative tools for well-being and self-expression.}

A questionnaire evaluates the user's perception of interacting with generative music and from this provide recommendations for future generative music systems and interfaces.}

Not to be left out, the private sector tracks our online footprint via our ISP or with a little help from facebook. Web services, such as advertisement servers and Google track our progress as we surf the net and click on links. The Mozilla plugin, Lightbeam (formerly Collusion), shows the user a visual map of every site a surfer sends data to. A interconnected web of advertisers and other (otherwise) invisible data-gatherers quickly builds during normal usage. We propose modifying this plugin so that as the graph builds, its state is broadcast visa OSC. Members of BiLE will receive and interpret those OSC messages in SuperCollider and PD. We will act as a translational object in a process of live-sonification. The collected data is the material with which we will develop a set of music tracks based on patterns we may discover. The findings of our data collection and the developed music will be presented in the form of an audiovisual live performance. Snippets of collected text and URLs will both form the basis of our audio interpretation, but also be projected on to a screen, so an audience can voyeuristically experience the actions taken on their behalf by governments and advertisers. After the concert, all of the scripts and documentation related to the data collection and sharing in the piece will be posted to github under a GPL license.}

This type of neural network has a compact structure and is capable of producing a large range of temporal dynamics. Due to these properties, we believe that CTRNNs combined with evolutionary algorithms (EA) could offer musicians many creative possibilities for the exploration of sound. In prior work, we have explored the use of interactive and target-based EA designs to tap into the creative possibilities of CTRNNs. Our results have shown promise for the use of CTRNNs in the audio domain. However, we feel neither EA designs allow both open-ended discovery and effective navigation of the CTRNN audio search space by musicians. Within this paper, we explore the possibility of using novelty search as an alternative algorithm that facilitates both open-ended and rapid discovery of the CTRNN creative search space.},

Through the lens of my experience as an improviser, instrument designer and dog guardian, and drawing from research into dog cognition, animal liberation, human-animal interaction, animal-computer interaction, zo\"omusicology and posthumanism, I explore the phenomena that is dog-human play, and draw comparisons between it and collaborative musical improvisation. Through the act of turning play into a musical performance, I discuss creativity, agency and consent, focusing on the social, collaborative and physical aspects of musicking, as opposed to the sound making itself, in an attempt to understand the way dogs (starting with this particular dog) might use play, ritual and perhaps even music-making, to navigate the world and connect with humans.}

The AirSticks, although fully-functioning, were used as props in live performances in order to evaluate potential mapping strategies that were later implemented for real. This use of mime when designing Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) can help overcome choice paralysis, break from established habits, and liberate creators to realise more meaningful parameter mappings. Bringing this process into an interactive performance environment acknowledges the audience as stakeholders in the design of these instruments, and also leads us to reflect upon the beliefs and assumptions made by an audience when engaging with the performance of such `magical' devices. This paper establishes two opposing strategies to parameter mapping, `movement-first' mapping, and the less conventional `sound-first' mapping that incorporates mime. We discuss the performance `One Five Nine', its transformation from a partial mime into a fully interactive presentation, and the influence this process has had on the outcome of the performance and the AirSticks as a whole.}

In prior studies, performers of interactive music self-reported sensing the presence of other musicians. The purpose of this exploratory study was to identify kinesthetic empathy between two individuals in a live electronic performance reported as perceived interactivity. Participants viewed eight videos, both real duets, and spliced solos appearing as real duets, rating each video. The questions guiding this study were: (a) is there a difference in perceived interactivity between the live and spliced duets, (b) is there a relationship between performance rating and perceived interactivity. Results showed a significant difference in the perceived interactivity of the video conditions. Further, the results showed a significant relationship between performance rating and perceived interactivity of the performers. The results suggest that perceived interactivity between performers could be a metric to measure kinesthetic empathy between performers facilitated by an interactive performance system that could be used to objectively measure the effectiveness of design and pedagogical interventions for new interfaces for musical expression.}

This approach breaks from the paradigm established within audio-haptic research over the last few decades where physical models within virtual environments are designed to transduce gesture into sonic output. We outline a method for generating multimodal terrains using basis functions, which are rendered into monochromatic visual representations for inspection. This visual terrain is traversed using a haptic controller, the NovInt Falcon, which in turn receives force information based on the grayscale value of its location in this virtual space. As the image is traversed by a performer the levels of resistance vary, and the image is realized as a physical terrain. We discuss the potential of this approach to afford engaging musical experiences for both the performer and the audience as iterated through numerous performances.}

However, previous studies have not dealt with improvisation support for the people who can play musical instruments but cannot improvise. In this study, to support such players' improvisation, we propose a novel improvisation supporting system called ism, which corrects musically unnatural melodies automatically. The main issue in realizing this system is how to detect notes to be corrected (i.e., musically unnatural or inappropriate). We propose a method for detecting notes to be corrected based on the N-gram model. This method first calculates N-gram probabilities of played notes, and then judges notes with low N-gram probabilities to be corrected. Experimental results show that the N-gram-based melody correction and the proposed system are useful for supporting improvisation.},

When performing live, the virtual singers listen to the human performer and respond to their singing by reading pitch, intonation and volume cues. In a standalone sound installation mode, singers use ultrasonic distance sensors to sense audience presence. Developed as part of the 1st author's practice-based PhD and artistic practice as a live performer, this work employs the \textbackslash emphsinging-voice to explore voice interactions in HCI beyond language, and innovative ways of live performing. How is technology supporting the effect of intimacy produced through voice? Does the act of surrounding the audience with responsive virtual singers challenge the traditional roles of performer-listener? To answer these questions, we draw upon the 1st author's experience with the system, and the interdisciplinary field of voice studies that consider the voice as the sound medium independent of language, capable of enacting a reciprocal connection between bodies.}

We constructed a robotic setup involving pull-solenoids attached to drum sticks which communicate with a computer through an Arduino microcontroller. The imitation framework allows for parameter adaptation to different mechanical constructions by learning the capabilities of the overall system being used. For the rhythmic vocabulary, we have considered regular stroke, flam and drag styles. A learning and calibration system was developed to efficiently perform grace notes for the drag rudiment as well as the single stroke and the flam rudiment. A second pre-performance process is introduced to minimize the latency difference between individual drum sticks in our mechanical setup. We also developed an off-line onset detection method to reliably recognize onsets from the microphone input. Once these pre-performance steps are taken, our setup will then listen to a human drummer's performance pattern, analyze for onsets, loudness, and rudiment pattern, and then play back using the learned parameters for the particular system. We conducted three different evaluations of our constructed system.}

In particular, in jazz improvisation, one of the major barriers is the mastery and appropriate selection of scales from a wide range, according to harmonic context and style. In this paper, we present AutoScale, an interactive software for making jazz improvisation more accessible by lifting the burden of scale selection from the musician while still allowing full controllability if desired. This is realized by implementing a MIDI effect that dynamically maps the desired scales onto a standardized layout. Scale selection can be pre-programmed, automated based on algorithmic lead sheet analysis, or interactively adapted. We discuss the music-theoretical foundations underlying our approach, the design choices taken for building an intuitive user interface, and provide implementations as VST plugin and web applications for use with a Launchpad or traditional MIDI keyboard.}

This is a difficult task to achieve: many new instruments are aimed at either the expert or amateur musician, with few instruments catering for both. There is often a balance between learning curve and the nuance of musical control in DMIs. In this paper we present a study conducted with non-musicians and guitarists playing guitar-derivative DMIs with variable levels of control intimacy: how the richness and nuance of a performer's movement translates into the musical output of an instrument. Findings suggest a significant difference in preference for levels of control intimacy between the guitarists and the non-musicians. In particular, the guitarists unanimously preferred the richest of the two settings whereas the non-musicians generally preferred the setting with lower richness. This difference is notable because it is often taken as a given that increasing richness is a way to make instruments more enjoyable to play, however, this result only seems to be true for expert players.},

The characteristics of research products are their holistic completeness as a design artefact, their situatedness in a specific cultural context, and the fact that they are evaluated for what they are, not what they will become. This paper discusses the ways in which many instruments created within the context of New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME), including those that are used in performances, often fall into the category of prototype.

  abstract = {We propose a new musical interface, ``GraviTone'' that produces sounds and musical compositions via interaction with spherical objects in a gravity-well benchtop setup. The interface consists of several spherical objects in different colours orbiting around the centrally placed static object on the spacetime fabric. The spherical objects are launched at a certain angle from the setup's periphery, and the objects' motion is tracked by an overhead camera and mapped to different parameters to generate sound. In GraviTone, users can experience sounds generated from objects' parameters and have control over different configurations. We use the setup to send Open Sound Control (OSC) signals and Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) signals to map different sounds and musical scales (Indian classical ragas and Western classical scale). We mapped the moving objects' parameters to control synth parameters, VSTs, and DAWs. Users can also route generated MIDI data into DAWs using preset configurations or customizing their frameworks for sound generation. We also generate real-time visuals corresponding to the object's movements for further immersion and interactivity. This integrated interface combines various domains like musical mathematics, sonification techniques, sound synthesis, and sound design for live music creation and real-time audiovisual composition.}

Then, a gesture recognition system captures gestures that are sent to a sound generator software. The proposed method was used to stage an artistic show in which a Soundpainter had to improvise with 6 different gestures to generate a musical composition from different sounds in real time. The accuracy of the gesture recognition system was evaluated as well as Soundpainter's user experience. In addition, a user evaluation study for using our proposed system in a learning context was also conducted. Current results open up perspectives for the design of new artistic expressions based on the use of automatic gestural recognition supported by Soundpainting language.}

The results show that 'gesture' is in fact used in 62 \% of all NIME papers, which is a significantly higher percentage than in other music conferences (ICMC and SMC), and much more frequently than it is used in the HCI and biomechanics communities. The results from a collocation analysis support the claim that 'gesture' is used broadly in the NIME community, and indicate that it ranges from the description of concrete human motion and system control to quite metaphorical applications.}

  abstract = {Neuroimaging is a powerful tool to explore how and why humans engage in music. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has allowed us to identify brain networks and regions implicated in a range of cognitive tasks including music perception and performance. However, MRI-scanners are noisy and cramped, presenting a challenging environment for playing an instrument. Here, we present an MRI-compatible polyphonic keyboard with a materials cost of 850 USD, designed and tested for safe use in 3T (three Tesla) MRI-scanners. We describe design considerations, and prior work in the field. In addition, we provide recommendations for future designs and comment on the possibility of using the keyboard in magnetoencephalography (MEG) systems. Preliminary results indicate a comfortable playing experience with no disturbance of the imaging process.}

Using co-reflection with four musical therapists and literature research, design guidelines related to this specific user-group and context are formed. This leads to a concept of which the most relevant aspects are discussed, before describing the user studies. Finally, the plan for the redesign is discussed. The WamBam has unique possibilities to deal with the low motor skills and cognitive abilities of severely intellectually disabled users while music therapists benefit from the greater versatility and portability of this design compared to other musical instruments. A prototype was tested with twenty users. Participants proved to be triggered positively by the WamBam, but three limiting usability issues were found. These issues were used as the fundamentals for a second prototype. Music therapists confirm the value of the WamBam for their practice.}

Using inaudible sound as a data medium, a digital data network among the audience and performer can be easily built with microphones and speakers, without requiring any additional hardware. ``TAPIR Sound Tag'' is a smart device framework for inaudible data communication that can be easily embedded in audience participatory performances and interactive arts. With a bandwidth of 900 Hz, a high transmission rate of 200 bps can be achieved, enabling peer-to-peer or broadcasting real-time data communication among smart devices. This system can be used without any advanced knowledge in signal processing and communication system theory; simply specifying carrier frequency and bandwidth with a few lines of code can start data communication. Several usage scenarios of the system are also presented, such as participating in an interactive performance by adding and controlling sound, and collaborative completion of an artist's work by audience. We expect this framework to provide a new way of audience interaction to artists, as well as further promoting audience participation by simplifying the process: using personal smart devices as a medium and not requiring additional hardware or complex settings.}

We address the mutual dependency among creative disciplines, highlighting the collaborative processes necessary to resolve conflicts during the design and rehearsal stages. Furthermore, we adopt a scenographic perspective to analyse how interactive media contributes to dramaturgical storytelling by crafting visual and auditory metaphors. We contextualize interaction design with reader- response theory and the horizon of expectations, demonstrating how interactive media fosters collaborative creativity and expands the narrative potential of theatrical storytelling.}

  abstract = {The Internet holds a lot of potential as a music listening, collaboration, and performance space. It has become commonplace to stream music and video of musical performance over the web. However, the goal of playing rhythmically synchronized music over long distances has remained elusive due to the latency inherent in networked communication. The farther apart two artists are from one another, the greater the delay. Furthermore, latency times can change abruptly with no warning. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to create a distributed, synchronized musical instrument that allows performers to play together over long distances, despite latency. We describe one such instrument, MalLo, which combats latency by predicting a musician's action before it is completed. MalLo sends information about a predicted musical note over the Internet before it is played, and synthesizes this note at a collaborator's location at nearly the same moment it is played by the performer. MalLo also protects against latency spikes by sending the prediction data across multiple network paths, with the intention of routing around latency.}

Instrument augmentation is a common approach for designing new interfaces for musical expression, as shown through hyperinstrument research. New visual affordances present in VR give designers new methods for augmenting instruments to extend not only their expressivity, but also their capabilities for computer assisted tutoring. In this work, we present VRMin, a mobile Mixed Reality (MR) application for augmenting a physical theremin, with an immersive virtual environment (VE), for real time computer assisted tutoring. We augment a physical theremin with 3D visual cues to indicate correct hand positioning for performing given notes and volumes. The physical theremin acts as a domain specific controller for the resulting MR environment. The initial effectiveness of this approach is measured by analyzing a performer's hand position while training with and without the VRMin. We also evaluate the usability of the interface using heuristic evaluation based on a newly proposed set of guidelines designed for VR musical environments.}

Traditionally, musical applications for touch surfaces have directly mapped touch coordinates to control parameters. However, recent work [9] is looking at new methods of control that use relational multi-point analysis. Instead of directly using touch coordinates, which are related to a global screen space, an initial touch is used as an `anchor' to create a local coordinate space in which subsequent touches can be located and compared. This local coordinate space frees touches from being locked to one single relationship, and allows for more complex interaction between touch events. So far, this method has only been implemented on Apple computer's small capacitive touch pads. Additionally, there has yet to be a user study that directly compares [9] against mappings of touch events within global coordinate spaces. With this in mind, we have developed and evaluated two interfaces with the aim of determining and quantifying some of these differences within the context of our custom large multi-touch surfaces [1].},

We developed the abdominal thoracic expansion measurement prototype wearable technology (ATEM-P), to measure a wind musician's breathing-induced expansion and contraction while they are playing. Our first study validates the ATEM-P with the gold standard of medical grade respiratory exertion measurement devices, the respiratory plethysmography inductance system (RIP). The results show that the ATEM-P has a strong correlation to the RIP system. Our second study provides quantitative and qualitative data about the correlation between a musician's breathing technique and the quality of their performance. We expected the results to show a correlation between the ATEM-P peak amplitudes and the quality of performance, i.e. better breathing-induced expansion leads to better quality of performance, however this was not the case. The results did show that there is a correlation between a musician's quality of performance and breath period. Results from the studies show that the ATEM-P has potential as an affordable and accessible wearable technology for wind musicians: a performance enhancement tool and an educational tool.}

The overall user experience offered by the technology can be described as that of tangibly and audibly interacting with a small hologram. \&\#160; More specifically, Ghostfinger implements automatic visualization of the dynamic instantiation/parametrization of algorithmic primitives that together determine the current haptic conditions for fingertip action. Some aspects of this visualization are visuospatial: A floating see-through cursor provides real-time, to-scale display of the fingerpad transducer, as it is being moved by the user. Simultaneously, each haptic primitive instance is represented by a floating block shape, type-colored, variably transparent, and possibly overlapping with other such block shapes. Further aspects of visualization are symbolic: Each instance is also represented by a type symbol, lighting up within a grid if the instance is providing output to the user. \&\#160; We discuss the system's user interface, programming interface, and potential applications. This from a general perspective that articulates and emphasizes the uniquely enabling role of the principle of computation in the implementation of new forms of instrumental control of musical sound. Beyond the currently presented technology, this also reflects more broadly on the role of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) in NIME.}

This approach has been applied in a master course focused on the exploration of expressiveness and on the role of the mapping component in the NIME creation chain, through hands-on and self-reflective approach based on a restrictive setup consisting of smart-phones and the Pd programming language. Working Groups were formed, and a 2-step DMI design process was applied, including 2 performance stages. The evaluation tools assessed both System and Performance aspects of each project, according to Listeners' impressions after each performance. Listeners' previous music knowledge was also considered. Through this methodology, students with different backgrounds were able to effectively engage in the NIME design processes, developing working DMI prototypes according to the demanded requirements; the assessment tools proved to be consistent for evaluating NIMEs systems and performances, and the fact of informing the design processes with the outcome of the evaluation, showed a traceable progress in the students outcomes.}

As the right instrument is located, a challenge of playing an application on the tablet is initiated. This application is an interactive digital representation of the found instrument, mimicking some of its key playing techniques, using a simplified scrolling on screen musical notation. The musical performance of the participant is graded on a point scale. After completion of the challenge, the participants' performances of the three instruments are played back simultaneously, constituting a composition. A qualitative evaluation of the application in a focus group interview with school children revealed that the children were more engaged when playing with the interactive application than when only watching a music video.}

Using conclusions drawn from previous studies about exploratory programming and our experience practicing live coding, we identified a need to support creation and mastery in the live coding space---specifically in the realm of live coding pertaining to musical creations. We developed a tool, SHARP, which attempted to empower live coders in both their exploration and performances. SHARP is a code editor extension that visualizes the history of each instrument that the live coder creates; the visualization can then be used to revisit the previous states of the instrument and create new ones. We believe that this extension will support live coders' exploration in practice as well as enable novel musical aesthetics in performance contexts. We did an initial evaluation of SHARP using an autoethnographic approach where one researcher used the tool over multiple sessions to compose a piece. From the autoethnography, we saw that SHARP supported composition by making it easier to explore different musical ideas and to revisit past states. Our analysis also hints at new possible features, such as being able to combine multiple previous states together using SHARP.}

Frequent controversies around AI applications in creative domains demonstrate insufficient consideration of ethical predicaments, but the abstract principles of current AI and data ethics documents provide little practical guidance. Pragmatic methods are urgently needed to support developers in ethical reflection of their work on creative-AI tools. In the wider context of value sensitive, people-oriented design, we present an analytical method that implements an ethically informed and power-sensitive stakeholder identification and mapping: Ethically Aligned Stakeholder Elicitation (EASE). As a case study, we test our method in workshops with six research groups that develop AI in musical contexts. Our results demonstrate that EASE supports critical self-reflection of the research and outreach practices among developers, discloses power relations and value tensions in the development processes, and foregrounds opportunities for stakeholder engagement. This can guide developers and the wider NIME community towards ethically aligned research and development of creative-AI.}

It was realized using an interactive sound and light system in which 5 video cameras were detecting the motion in the room connected to a 4-channel sound system and a set of 14 light modules. During five weeks people of all ages came to dance and move around in the installation. The installation attracted a wide range of people of all ages and the tentative evaluation indicates that it was very positively received and that it encouraged free movement in the intended way.

We present a case study of the composition process and realization of \&\#8220;Climb!\&\#8221;, written for Disklavier and a digital interactive engine, which was co-developed together with the musical score. Specifically, the engine combines a system for recognising and responding to musical trigger phrases along with a dynamic digital score renderer. This tool chain allows for the composer's original scoring to include notational elements such as trigger phrases to be automatically extracted to auto-configure the engine for live performance. We reflect holistically on the development process to date and highlight the emerging challenges and opportunities. For example, this includes the potential for further developing the workflow around the scoring process and the ways in which support for musical triggers has shaped the compositional approach.}

This provides a proof-of-concept that this robotic fabrication technique might be a candidate method for creating novel metallic ideophones that are based on sheet deformations. Given that the technique does not require molding, it is well suited for both rapid and iterative prototyping and the fabrication of individual pieces. With advances in miniaturization, this approach may also be suitable for personal fabrication. In this paper we discuss this technique as well as aspects of the geometry of stadium cymbals and their impact on the resulting instrument.},

  abstract = {Ghost Play is a violin-playing robot that aims to realize bowing and fingering similar to human players. Existing violin-playing machines have faced various problems concerning performance techniques owing to constraints imposed by their design. Bowing and fingering that require accurate and high-acceleration movement (e.g., a spiccato, tremolo, and glissando) are essential but challenging. To overcome this problem, Ghost Play is equipped with seven electromagnetic linear actuators, three for controlling the bow (i.e., the right hand), and the other four for controlling the pitch on each string (i.e., the left hand). The violin-playing robot is mounted with an unmodified violin bow. A sensor is attached to the bow to measure bow pressure. The control software receives a time series of performance data and manipulates the actuators accordingly. The performance data consists of the bow direction, bow speed, bow pressure, pitch, vibrato interval, vibrato width, and string to be drawn. We also developed an authoring tool for the performance data using a graphic user interface. Finally, we demonstrated Ghost Play performing bowing and fingering techniques such as a spiccato, tremolo, and glissando, as well as a piece of classical music.}

Beginning of the last decade was marked by the word ``revolution'' in relation to ``maker's culture'' at least in some publications. This has influenced the sphere of physical computing in arts and NIME sphere as well. As currently there are more and more possibilities to create new instruments, we think that it can be useful to think of approaches to conceptualize these creations. This paper is an attempt to suggest methodology for NIME prototyping, based on evolutionary metaphor. First we observe the application of evolutionary concepts to the field of music technology, briefly discussing its appearance in related publications. We then assemble our own operational concept, which can be used for the direct prototyping of interfaces. Mainly by introducing metaphorical ``DNA'', inside which the ``gene'' of ``interactive kinematic concept'' is of a particular interest, and also by applying the now obsolete but useful ``Meckel--Serres recapitulation hypothesis'' (embryological parallelism) as a model for rapid prototyping. Understanding the speculative nature of such an approach we do not offer it as a scientific basis for classification, research or prediction, but as a workable concept for development, which can lead to valuable results. In the end we describe two case studies of NIMEs, which were prototyped in the discussed fashion, showing illustrations and reflecting on the practicalities.}

The classic puzzle game, for one person, is extended by mapping the moves of the game through a self contained system using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, triggering both analogue and digital sound. The solitaire board, as instrument, is presented as a wood and Perspex box with the hardware inside. Ball bearings function as both solitaire pegs and switches, while a purpose built solenoid controlled monochord and ball bearing run provide the analogue sound source, which is digitally manipulated in real-time, according to the sequences of game moves. The creative intention of Sounds of Solitaire is that the playful approach to participation in a musical experience, provided by the material for music making in real-time, demonstrates an integrated approach to concepts of composing, performing and listening.}

The acoustic wind machine was fitted with 3D printed gearing to mechanically drive an optical encoder and control the digital synthesis engine in real time. The design of this system was informed by an initial comparison between the acoustic wind machine and the first iteration of its digital counterpart. To explore the main acoustic parameters and the sonic range of the acoustic and digital wind machines in operation, three simple and distinct rotational gestures were performed, with the resulting sounds recorded simultaneously, facilitating an analysis of the real-time performance of both sources. The results are reported, with an outline of future work.}

  abstract = {Robotic instrument designers tend to focus on the number of sound control parameters and their resolution when trying to develop expressivity in their instruments. These parameters afford greater sonic nuance related to elements of music that are traditionally associated with expressive human performances including articulation, timbre, dynamics, and phrasing. Equating the capacity for sonic nuance and musical expression stems from the ``transitive'' perspective that musical expression is an act of emotional communication from performer to listener. However, this perspective is problematic in the case of robotic instruments since we do not typically consider machines to be capable of expressing emotion. Contemporary theories of musical expression focus on an ``intransitive'' perspective, where musical meaning is generated as an embodied experience. Understanding expressivity from this perspective allows listeners to interpret performances by robotic instruments as possessing their own expressive meaning, even though the performer is a machine. It also enables musicians working with robotic instruments to develop their own unique vocabulary of expressive gestures unique to mechanical instruments. This paper explores these issues of musical expression, introducing the concept of mechatronic expression as a compositional and design strategy that highlights the musical and performative capabilities unique to robotic instruments.},

Therefore, it was conceived and carried out starting from the body of an electric guitar. The fingerboard of this guitar was equipped with two lines of sensors: linear position sensors, and tactile pressure sensors. These two lines of sensors are used as two virtual strings. Their two ends are the bridge and the nut of the guitar. The design of the instrument is made in a way that the position of a finger, on one of these virtual strings, corresponds to the note, which would have been played on a real and vibrating string. On the soundboard of the guitar, a controller, with 3 degrees of freedom, allows to drive other synthesis parameters. We then describe how this interface is integrated in a musical audio system and serves as a musical instrument.},

These measurements are complex and interdependent so an echo statenetwork, a form of recurrent neural network, is employed totranslate the sensor readings into usable control data.A cube shaped controller was built and evaluated in thecontext of the haptic exploration of sound synthesis parameter spaces. Eight participants experimented with the controller and were interviewed about their experiences.

They have, however, seldom been used in this area, so this paper explores their possible uses. This project contributes a new open source library, which was developed to allow ESNs to run in the Pure Data dataflow environment. Several use cases were explored, focusing on addressing current issues in mapping research. ESNs were found to work successfully in scenarios of pattern classification, multiparametric control, explorative mapping and the design of nonlinearities and uncontrol. Un-trained behaviours are proposed, as augmentations to the conventional reservoir system that allow the player to introduce potentially interesting non-linearities and uncontrol into the reservoir. Interactive evolution style controls are proposed as strategies to help design these behaviours, which are otherwise dependent on arbitrary parameters. A study on sound classification shows that ESNs can reliably differentiate between two drum sounds, and also generalise to other similar input. Following evaluation of the use cases, heuristics are proposed to aid the use of ESNs in computer music scenarios.}

We collected interview evidence about the participants' experience and analysed the data with using a grounded theory approach. The results demonstrated that the technology has the potential to create immersive spaces where an audience can feel safe to experiment musically, and showed how AR can intervene in sound perception to instrumentalise an environment. The results also revealed caveats about the use of audio AR, mainly centred on social inhibition and seamlessness of experience, and finding a balance between mediated worlds so that there is space for interplay between the two.},

  abstract = {Feedback instruments offer radical new ways of engaging with instrument design and musicianship. They are defined by recurrent circulation of signals through the instrument, which give the instrument `a life of its own' and a 'stimulating uncontrollability'. Arguably, the most interesting musical behaviour in these instruments happens when their dynamic complexity is maximised, without falling into saturating feedback. It is often challenging to keep the instrument in this zone; this research looks at algorithmic ways to manage the behaviour of feedback loops in order to make feedback instruments more playable and musical; to expand and maintain the `sweet spot'. We propose a solution that manages gain dynamics based on measurement of complexity, using a realtime implementation of the Effort to Compress algorithm. The system was evaluated with four musicians, each of whom have different variations of string-based feedback instruments, following an autobiographical design approach. Qualitative feedback was gathered, showing that the system was successful in modifying the behaviour of these instruments to allow easier access to edge transition zones, sometimes at the expense of losing some of the more compelling dynamics of the instruments. The basic efficacy of the system is evidenced by descriptive audio analysis. This paper is accompanied by a dataset of sounds collected during the study, and the open source software that was written to support the research.}

  abstract = {While the technical affordances of virtual reality (VR) have provided new ways for artists to aestheticize immersion, spectator agency, embodiment and multi-sensory engagement, they have also opened new possibilities for composers interested in exploring how interactive musical scores might become a means through which collaboration itself becomes the locus of aesthetic expression. In this paper, the author will provide an overview of an ongoing project which explores new ways of thinking about musical collaboration in VR through the 3D visualization of interactive, graphic scores adapted from works by composers Earle Brown, Christian Wolff, and Toru Takemitsu. The research demonstrates how VR can transform traditional score interpretation by creating dynamic, interactive environments that enable collaborative musical expression, challenge conventional notation, and offer novel ways of negotiating musical performance through networked, multi-user interactions.}

A music performance can be described with compositional and expressive properties varying over time. In those property changes we often observe particular patterns, and such a pattern can be understood as a "gesture", since it serves as a medium transferring specific emotions. Assuming a finite number of latent states on each property value changes, we can describe those gestures with statistical latent-states models, and train them by unsupervised learning algorithms. In addition, model entropy provides us a measure for different effects of each properties on the gesture implementation. Test result on some of real performances indicates that the trained models could capture the structure of gestures observed in the given performances, and detect their boundaries. The entropy-based measure was informative to understand the effectiveness of each property on the gesture implementation. Test result on large corpora indicates that our model has potentials for afurther model improvement.},

In order to make the DJ mix a single continuous audio stream, DJs control various audio effects on a DJ mixer system particularly in the transition region between one track and the next track and modify the audio signals in terms of volume, timbre, tempo, and other musical elements. There have been research efforts to imitate the DJ mixing techniques but they are mainly rule-based approaches based on domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze the DJ mixer control from real-world DJ mixes toward a data-driven approach to imitate the DJ performance. Specifically, we estimate the mixing gain trajectories between the two tracks using sub-band analysis with constrained convex optimization. We evaluate the method by reconstructing the original tracks using the two source tracks and the gain estimate, and show that the proposed method outperforms the linear crossfading as a baseline and the single-band analysis. A listening test from the survey of 14 participants also confirms that our proposed method is superior among them.}

Motivated to explore group-based live performance within VR, SVOrk has designed and crafted virtual musical interfaces, fantastical 3D-modeled environments, and a network infrastructure to support real-time shared participation. Inherent within this initiative is a reimagining of conventional concert experiences, introducing virtual lobbies, customizable avatars, and immersive audience interactions. These experimental features explore new forms of social presence, audience identities, and expressive communication to help address the overarching question, ``What does it mean to participate in a VR musical performance?'' SVOrk's premiere concert took place in June 2024 with five performers and approximately 60 audience members (across five sessions), featuring a program of six musical works. This paper describes the motivations behind SVOrk, its research and development process---including designs for networking, avatar, and audience interaction---and takeaways from the premiere concert. We also present audience feedback and reflect on our experiences in curating group VR performances.}

To increase affordability and portability of force-feedback implementations in DMI design, we designed our platform to be wireless, self-contained and built from commercially available components. To provide examples of modularity and portability, we integrated TorqueTuner into a standalone haptic knob and into an existing DMI, the T-Stick. We implemented 3 musical applications (Pitch wheel, Turntable and Exciter), by mapping sensors to sound synthesis in audio programming environment SuperCollider. While the original goal was to simulate the haptic feedback associated with turning a knob, we found that the platform allows for further expanding interaction possibilities in application scenarios where rotary control is familiar.}

The system generates the improvised melodies based on (1) an outline sketched by the user using a mouse or a touch screen, (2) a genetic algorithm based on a dataset of existing music pieces as well as musical knowledge, and (3) an expressive performance model for timing and dynamic transformations. The aim of the system is to allow people with no prior musical knowledge to be able to enjoy playing music by improvising melodies in real time.}

The hierarchical structure is represented as astochastic context-free grammar, which is used to generateaccompaniment patterns based on the history of temporalpatterns.

We believe that this sound can be considered musically rich and expressive because each door has specific sound characteristics and each person makes it sound slightly different. By augmenting the door to create an unexpected sound, this project encourages us to listen to our daily lives with a musician's critical ear, and reminds us of the musicality of our everyday activities.},

Analyzing trends in Vocal NIMEs can help the community better understand common interests, identify uncharted territories, and explore directions for future research. We identified a corpus of 98 papers about Vocal NIMEs from 2001 to 2021, which we analyzed in 3 ways. First, we automatically extracted latent themes and possible categories using natural language processing. Taking inspiration from concepts surfaced through this process, we then defined several core dimensions with associated descriptors of Vocal NIMEs and assigned each paper relevant descriptors under each dimension. Finally, we defined a classification system, which we then used to uniquely and more precisely situate each paper on a map, taking into account the overall goals of each work. Based on our analyses, we present trends and challenges, including questions of gender and diversity in our community, and reflect on opportunities for future work.}

For the purposes of this research a laptop ensemble is defined as a performing group of three or more musicians for whom the laptop is the main sound generating source and who typically perform together in the same room. The concept of democracy (i.e. governance by members of the group) has been used as a starting point to assess firstly what types of organisational structures are currently used in laptop ensembles and secondarily to what extent laptop ensembles consider the implications of organisational and social structure on their musical output. To assess this I recorded a number of data points including ensemble size, whether the group has a director or conductor, use of homogenous vs. heterogenous hardware and software, whether they perform composed pieces or mainly improvise, the level of network interaction and whether or not the ensemble has an academic affiliation. The survey allowed me to define a scale of democracy in laptop ensembles and typical features of the most and least democratic groups. Some examples are given of democratic and autocratic activity in existing laptop ensembles. This work is part of a larger scale project investigating the effect of social structures on the musical output of laptop ensembles.}

To interrogate these questions we undertook a survey in October 2019, gaining 117 responses. The survey collected statistical information on the use of pre-packaged and self-written music AI software. Respondents reported a range of musical outputs including producing recordings, live performance and generative work across many genres of music making. The survey also gauged general attitudes towards AI in music and provided an open field for general comments. The responses to the survey suggested a forward-looking attitude to music AI with participants often pointing to the future potential of AI tools, rather than present utility. Optimism was partially related to programming skill with those with more experience showing higher skepticism towards the current state and future potential of AI.}

Posture deviation is measured in the following way: Torso misalignment is calculated by comparing hip center joint, shoulder center joint and neck joint position with an ideal posture position retrieved in an initial calibration procedure. Pelvis deviation is expressed as the xz-rotation of the hip-center joint. The posture deviation is sonified via a varying cut-off frequency of a high-pass filter applied to floating water sound. The posture deviation is visualized via a curve and a rigged skeleton in which the misaligned torso parts are color-coded. In an experiment with 9-12 year-old dance students from a ballet school, comparing the audio-visual feedback modality with no feedback leads to an increase in posture accuracy (p \&lt; 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.047). Reaction card feedback and expert interviews indicate that the feedback is considered fun and useful for training independently from the teacher.}

Since the user interface on the PC side is running on the Max/MSP environment that has high flexibility, a user can freely reconfigure the layout of GUI controllers. A single `Spinner' control device consists of a rotary encoder with a push button to count rotations and a photo IC to detect specific patterns from the GUI objects to identify. Since `Spinner' features a simple identification method, it is capable of being used with normal display devices like LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) or a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) and so on. A user can access multiple `Spinner' devices simultaneously. By using this system, a user can build a reconfigurable user interface.},

The classic foot activated effect pedals that are used to alter the sound of the instrument are stationary, forcing the performer to return to the same location in order to interact with the pedals. This paper presents a new design that enables the performer to interact with the effect pedals anywhere on the stage. By designing a foot\&instrument-mounted effect controller, we kept the strongest part of the classical pedal design, while allowing the activation of the effect at any location on the stage. The usability of the device has been tested on thirty experienced guitar players. Their performance has been recorded and compared, and their opinion has been investigated through questionnaire and interview. The results of the experiment showed that, in theory, foot\&instrument-mounted effect controller can replace standard effect pedals and at the same time provide more mobility on a stage.}

This work attempted to simplify improvisation by delegating the process of switching scales to a computer. An open-source software MIDI remapper called ChordEase was developed that dynamically alters the pitch of notes, in order to fit them to the chord scales of a predetermined song. ChordEase modifies the behavior of ordinary MIDI instruments, giving them new interfaces that permit non-modal music to be approached as if it were modal. Multiple instruments can be remapped simultaneously, using a variety of mapping functions, each optimized for a particular musical role. Harmonization and orchestration can also be automated. By facilitating the selection of scale tones, ChordEase enables performers to focus on other aspects of improvisation, and thus creates new possibilities for musical expression.}

The fingerboard has four strips of conductive PLA filament which produce an electric signal when fingers press down on each string. While these sensors are physically robust, they are mechanically assembled and thus easy to replace if damaged. The performer can also trigger presets via four FSRs attached to the body of the violin. The instrument is completely wireless, giving the performer the freedom to move throughout the performance space. While the sensing fingerboard is installed in place of the traditional fingerboard, all other electronics can be removed from the augmented instrument, maintaining the aesthetics of a traditional violin. Our design allows violinists to naturally create music for interactive performance and improvisation without requiring new instrumental techniques. In this paper, we describe the design of the instrument, experiments leading to the sensing fingerboard, and performative applications of the instrument.}

We promote tangible interaction as an alternative learning method in the creation of synthetic soundscape based on sounds recorded in a natural outdoor environment as main sources of sound. We investigate how schoolchildren perceive natural sources of sound and explore practices that reuse prerecorded material through a tangible interactive controller. We discuss the potential benefits of using TUIs as an alternative empirical method for tangible learning and interaction design, and its impact on encouraging and motivating creativity in children. We summarize our findings and review children's biehavioural indicators of engagement and enjoyment in order to provide insight to the design of TUIs based on user experience.}

It replaces the whammy bar of a traditional Fender vibrato system with a sensor-equipped whammy bar. The functionality of the present prototype includes separate readings of force applied towards and from the guitar body, as well as an end knob for variable control. Further functionality includes a hinged system allowing for digital effect control either with or without the mechanical manipulation of string tension. By incorporating digital sensors to the idiomatic whammy bar interface, one would potentially bring guitarists a high level of control intimacy with the device, and thus lead to a closer interaction with effects.},

The synthesizer was evaluated with a user study. Participants listened to music generated by the synthesizer, and described the music with words. The arousal of the words they entered was highly correlated with the intended arousal of the music. The same was, surprisingly, not true for valence. The synthesizer is online, at [redacted URL].}

The particles move in the screen to synthesize sounds according to their own physical properties, which are shape, size, mass, linear and angular velocity, friction, restitution, etc. If a particle collides with others, a percussive sound is generated. A player can play music by the simple operation of touching or dragging on the screen of the device. Using a three-axis acceleration sensor, a player can perform music by shuffling or tilting the device. Each particle sounds just a simple tone. However, a large amount of various particles play attractive music by aggregating their sounds. This concept has been inspired by natural sounds made from an assembly of simple components, for example, rustling leaves or falling rain. For a novice who has no experience of playing a musical instrument, it is easy to learn how to play instantly and enjoy performing music with intuitive operation. Our system is used for musical instruments for interactive music entertainment.},

The system introduces a newgesture-sound relationship in the electric string instrumentplaying environment, namely the use of percussivetechniques on the instrument's body which are null inregular circumstances due to selective and exclusivemicrophone use for the strings. Instrument bodypercussions are widely used in the acoustic instrumentalpraxis.

A collaborative project, Sound Gloves, presented here exemplifies such a concept by dissolving the space between performers and audience. Our approach resulted in a continuous interaction between audience and performers, in which the social dynamics was changed in a positive way in a live performance context of NIMEs.

A graphical user interface supports user understanding with live visualizations of the effects of each dimension. The applications of this interface are three-fold; further perceptual timbre studies, usage as a practical shortcut for synthesizers, and educating users about the frequency domain, sound synthesis, and the concept of timbre. The project has since been expanded to a standalone version independent of a computer and a purely online web-audio version.}

Musical instruments have been refined the last centuries which makes them highly specialized instruments that nearly all requires at least two functioning hands. In this study we try to enable people with hemiplegia to play a real electrical guitar by modifying it in a way that make people with hemiplegia able to actually play the guitar. We developed the guitar platform to utilize sensors to capture the rhythmic motion of alternative fully functioning limbs, such as a foot, knee or the head to activate a motorized fader moving a pick back and forth across the strings. The approach employs the flexibility of a programmable digital system which allows us to scale and map different ranges of data from various sensors to the motion of the actuator and thereby making it easier adapt to individual users. To validate and test the instrument platform we collaborated with the Helena Elsass Center during their 2013 Summer Camp to see if we actually succeeded in creating an electrical guitar that children with hemiplegia could actually play. The initial user studies showed that children with hemiplegia were able to play the actuated guitar by producing rhythmical movement across the strings that enables them to enter a world of music they so often see as closed.}

The long DAF matched a subdivision of the overall tempo. We compared their performance using two different input devices with feedback before or on activation. While 250ms DAF hardly affected musically trained participants, non-musically trained participants' performance declined substantially both in mean synchronization error and its spread. Neither tempo nor input devices affected performance.}

In this paper, we propose solutions to these problems. In the recent extension of UrMus, a programming environment for mobile music application development, we introduce a paradigm of shared and individual namespaces safeguard against conflicts in parallel coding activities. We also develop live variable view that communicates live changes in state among live coders, networked performers, and the audience. Lastly, we integrate collaborative aspects of programming execution into built-in live chat, which enables not only communication with others, but also distributed execution of code.}

We present conga, a software framework that enables automatic recognition and interpretation ofconducting gestures. conga is able to recognize multiple types ofgestures with varying levels of difficulty for the user to perform,from a standard four-beat pattern, to simplified up-down conducting movements, to no pattern at all. conga provides an extendablelibrary of feature detectors linked together into a directed acyclicgraph; these graphs represent the various conducting patterns asgesture profiles. At run-time, conga searches for the best profileto match a user's gestures in real-time, and uses a beat prediction algorithm to provide results at the sub-beat level, in additionto output values such as tempo, gesture size, and the gesture'sgeometric center. Unlike some previous approaches, conga doesnot need to be trained with sample data before use. Our preliminary user tests show that conga has a beat recognition rate ofover 90\%. conga is deployed as the gesture recognition systemfor Maestro!, an interactive conducting exhibit that opened in theBetty Brinn Children's Museum in Milwaukee, USA in March2006.},

After joining the network, by actuating the smartphone's accelerometer, the players apply gravitational force to a swarm of particles in the virtual space. Machine learning-based gesture pattern recognition is parallelly used to increase the functionality of the gestural command. Through this interface, the player can achieve intuitive control of gravitation in virtual reality (VR) space. The gravitation becomes the medium of the system involving physics, graphics, and sonification which composes a multimodal compositional language with cross-modal correspondence. Entangled is built on AlloLib, which is a cross-platform suite of C++ components for building interactive multimedia tools and applications. Throughout the script, the reason for each decision is elaborated arguing the importance of crossmodal correspondence in the design procedure.}

In this paper, we discuss an artistic practice that organizes streaming videos to perform a real-time improvisation via live coding. A live coder uses any available video from YouTube, a video streaming service, as source material to perform an improvised audiovisual piece. The challenge is to manipulate the emerging media that are streamed from a networked service. The musical gesture can be limited due to the provided functionalities of the YouTube API. However, the potential sonic and visual space that a musician can explore is practically infinite. The practice embraces the juxtaposition of manipulating emerging media in old-fashioned ways similar to experimental musicians in the 60's physically manipulating tape loops or scratching vinyl records on a phonograph while exploring the possibility of doing so by drawing on the gigantic repository of all kinds of videos. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of using streaming videos from the platform as musical materials in computer music and introduce a live coding environment that we developed for real-time improvisation.}

While respiration is frequently considered as an indicator of the metabolic state of human body that contains meaningful information for medicine or psychology, motional aspect of respiration has been relatively unnoticed in spite of its strong correlation with muscles and the brain. This paper introduces an interactive system to control music playback for dance performances based on the respiration pattern of the dancer. A wireless wearable sensor device detects the dancer's respiration, which is then utilized to modify the dynamic of music. Two different respiration-dynamic mappings were designed and evaluated through public performances and private tests by professional choreographers. Results from this research suggest a new conceptual approach to musical applications of respiration based on the technical characteristics of music and dance.},

  abstract = {Modern computer music performances often involve a musical instrument that is primarily digital; software runs on a computer, and the physical form of the instrument is the computer. In such a practice, the performance interface is rendered on a computer screen for the performer. There has been a concern in using a laptop as a musical instrument from the audience's perspective, in that having ``a laptop performer sitting behind the screen'' makes it difficult for the audience to understand how the performer is creating music. Mirroring a computer screen on a projection screen has been one way to address the concern and reveal the performer's instrument. This paper introduces and discusses the author's computer music practice, in which a performer actively considers screen mirroring as an essential part of the performance, beyond visualization of music. In this case, screen mirroring is not complementary, but inevitable from the inception of the performance. The related works listed within explore various roles of screen mirroring in computer music performance and helps us understand empirical and logistical findings in such practices.}

Too often soundscapes and background music are predetermined, repetitive and somewhat predictable. Yet, there is room for more complex and interesting sonification schemes that can improve the sensation of presence in a Virtual Environment. In this paper we propose a system that automatically generates original background music in real-time called VR-RoBoser. As a test case we present the application of VR-RoBoser to a dynamic avatar that explores its environment. We show that the musical events are directly and continuously generated and influenced by the behavior of the avatar in three-dimensional virtual space, generating a context dependent sonification.},

He was never able to perform the piece with those forces, however, due to his inability to synchronize multiple pianolas. Thus all performances of the piece in his lifetime, and for decades after, were done with a single pianola or player piano.* The author traces the origin of the concept of synchronizing multiple pianolas, and explains the attendant technological issues. He examines attempts to synchronize mechanical pianos and other time-based devices at the time of Ballet m\'ecanique's composition, and suggests that Antheil's vision for his piece was not as farfetched as has long been thought.},

On the one hand, we aim to determine action-based perceptual invariants that allow us to establish pertinent relations between gesture qualities and sound features. On the other hand, we are interested in analysing how an interactive model-based sonification can provide useful and effective feedback for dance practitioners. From this point of view, our research explicitly addresses the convergence between the scientific understandings provided by the field of movement sonification and the traditional know-how developed over the years within the digital instrument and interaction design communities. A key component of our study is the combination between physically-based sound synthesis and motion features analysis. This approach has proven effective in providing interesting insights for devising novel sonification models for artistic and scientific purposes, and for developing a collaborative platform involving the designer, the musician and the performer.}

The second is based on interpolation between presets represented by polygons on screen and is called holistic. Participants had to listen to, memorize, and search for sound presets characterized by four parameters. Ten different configurations of sound synthesis and processing were presented to each participant, once for each approach. The performance scores of 28 participants (not including early testers) were computed using two measured values: the search duration, and the parametric distance between the reference and answered presets. Compared to the analytic sliders-based interface, the holistic interpolation-based interface demonstrated a significant performance improvement for 60\% of sound synthesizers. The other 40\% led to equivalent results for the analytic and holistic interfaces. Using sliders, expert users performed nearly as well as they did with interpolation. Beginners and intermediate users struggled more with sliders, while the interpolation allowed them to get quite close to experts' results.}

  abstract = {Brain computer interfaces are being widely adopted for music creation and interpretation, and they are becoming a truly new category of musical instruments. Indeed, Miranda has coined the term Brain-computer Musical Interface (BCMI) to refer to this category. There are no "plug-n-play" solutions for a BCMI, these kinds of tools usually require the setup and implementation of particular software configurations, customized for each EEG device. The Emotiv Insight is a low-cost EEG apparatus that outputs several kinds of data, such as EEG rhythms or facial expressions, from the user's brain activity. We have developed a BCMI, in the form of a freely available middle-ware, using the Emotiv Insight for EEG input and signal processing. The obtained data, via blue-tooth is broad-casted over the network formatted for the OSC protocol. Using this software, we tested the device's adequacy as a BCMI by using the provided data in order to control different sound synthesis algorithms in MaxMSP. We conclude that the Emotiv Insight is an interesting choice for a BCMI due to its low-cost and ease of use, but we also question its reliability and robustness.}

The sounds are transduced by a piezoelectric sensor inside the wooden body, so any tactile contact with TedStick is transmitted as audio and further processed by a computer. The main method for performing with TedStick focuses on extracting diverse sounds from within the resonant properties of TedStick it-self. This is done by holding TedStick in one hand and a standard drumstick in the opposite hand while tapping, rubbing, or scraping the two against each other. Gestural movements of TedStick are then mapped to parameters for several sound effects including pitch shift, delay, reverb and low/high pass filters. Using this technique the hand holding the drumstick can control the acoustic sounds/interaction between the sticks while the hand holding TedStick can fo-cus purely on controlling the sound manipulation and effects parameters.},

Often, coordination is at the level of gestures and phrases without synchronization at the beat level (or perhaps the notion of "beat" does not even exist). In music with beats, fine-grain synchronization can be achieved by having humans adapt to the computer (e.g. following a click track), or by computer accompaniment in which the computer follows a predetermined score. We consider an alternative scenario in which improvisation prevents traditional score following, but where synchronization is achieved at the level of beats, measures, and cues. To explore this new type of human-computer interaction, we have created new software abstractions for synchronization and coordination of music and interfaces in different modalities. We describe these new software structures, present examples, and introduce the idea of music notation as an interactive musical interface rather than a static document.},

We introduce ChAI's interactive AI tools and toys and highlight philosophical, ethical, and cultural considerations. Focusing on interactive machine learning, audio analysis, feature extraction, and audio re-synthesis, this paper shows how ChAI could be used to create playful, expressive systems (in an age of generative AI that tends to limit human interaction in favor of prompt-based automation). In the critical-making course, ChAI was used alongside reflections on AI's broad impact on the arts and who makes art, while stressing the importance of understanding AI's societal and cultural implications. This work not only introduces a new tool but also invites broader conversation on the role of HCI, play, and "small-data" approaches, in music and AI practice and education.}

During sessions, users collaboratively perform semi-improvised music in quasi-real time. The production and interpretation of individual musical gestures ("drum hits") are visualized in a continuously devised feedback network. The music produced can be treated as a starting point for compositions developed asynchronously, or as complete pieces of music produced live.}

Even worse, they are not easy to be revised. Most importantly, there should be more amusing and engaging interaction between a tuning trainer and a user which is able to exchange roles of tuner and player. In this research, we implement an open-source program named ``Harmonic Intonation Trainer'' in Pure Data. It includes most of essential elements of a smart tuner. A user can tune his pitch while optionally hearing (through earphones) the target pitch and other harmonic intervals in respective octaves. Moreover, in its interactive accompanist mode, a user's input pitch serves as the reference frequency; the program follows his intonation to generate corresponding harmonic intervals. Additionally, user can straightforwardly edit all parameters and patches by Pure Data. Any adoption or revision is absolutely welcome. Finally, we will initiate another research to test and to inspect experimental results from student orchestras so that its future version is expected to be more sophisticated.}

The system was designed as a digital musical instrument that calibrates itself to each user during an initial training process. During training musicians provide their gestural vocabulary, associating each gesture to a corresponding pedalboard preset. The selection of the most effective features, in synergy with the best set of muscles, was conducted to optimize the learning rate of the system. The system was assessed with a user study encompassing seven expert guitar players. Results showed that, on average, participants appreciated the concept underlying the system and deemed it to be able to foster their creativity.}

  abstract = {MaxMSP is a visual programming language for creating interactive audiovisual media that has found great success as a flexible and accessible option for computer music. However, the visual interface requires manual object placement and connection, which can be inefficient. Automated patch editing is possible either by visual programming with the [thispatcher] object or text-based programming with the [js] object. However, these objects cannot automatically create and save new patches, and they operate at run-time only, requiring live input to trigger patch construction. There is no solution for automated creation of multiple patches at compile-time, such that the constructed patches do not contain their own constructors. To this end, we present MaxPy, an open-source Python package for programmatic construction and manipulation of MaxMSP patches. MaxPy replaces the manual actions of placing objects, connecting patchcords, and saving patch files with text-based Python functions, thus enabling dynamic, procedural, high-volume patch generation at compile-time. MaxPy also includes the ability to import existing patches, allowing users to move freely between text-based Python programming and visual programming with the Max GUI. MaxPy enables composers, programmers, and creators to explore expanded possibilities for complex, dynamic, and algorithmic patch construction through text-based Python programming of MaxMSP.}

In this regard, we present two different mappings for the MindCube, with and without AI. With our generative AI mapping, we propose a way to infuse meaning within a latent space and techniques to navigate through it with an external controller. We discuss our results and propose directions for future work.}

The interface extracts sketch features in real-time that were shown to correlate with sound characteristics and can be mapped to synthesis and audio effect parameters via Open Sound Control (OSC). This modular approach allows for an easy integration into an existing workflow and can be tailored to individual preferences. The interface can be accessed online through a web-browser on a computer, laptop, smartphone or tablet and does not require specialised hard- or software. We demonstrate SketchSynth with an iPad for sketch input to control synthesis and audio effect parameters in the Ableton Live digital audio workstation (DAW). A MIDI controller is used to play notes and trigger pre-recorded accompaniment. This work serves as an example of how perceptual research can help create strong, meaningful gesture-to-sound mappings.}

While in many ways digital interfacing offers considerable power and flexibility, digital protocols, equipment and audio workstations often tend to suggest particular music-making work-flows and have resolution and timing limitations. This paper describes the creation of a hardware interface that allows direct communication between analogue synthesizer equipment and simple robotic musical instruments entirely in the analogue domain without the use of computers, microcontrollers or software of any kind. Several newly created musical robots of various designs are presented, together with a custom built hardware interface with circuitry that enables analogue synthesizers to interface with the robots without any digital intermediary. This enables novel methods of musical expression, creates new music-making work-flows for composing and improvising with musical robots and takes advantage of the low latency and infinite resolution of analogue circuits.},

  abstract = {While most musical robots that are capable of playing the drum kit utilise a relatively simple striking motion, the hi-hat, with the additional degree of motion provided by its pedal, requires more involved control strategies in order to produce expressive performances on the instrument. A robotic hi-hat should be able to control not only the striking timing and velocity to a high degree of precision, but also dynamically control the position of the two cymbals in a way that is consistent, reproducible and intuitive for composers and other musicians to use. This paper describes the creation of a new, multifaceted hi-hat control system that utilises a closed-loop distance sensing and calibration mechanism in conjunction with an embedded musical information retrieval system to continuously calibrate the hi-hat's action both before and during a musical performance. This is achieved by combining existing musical robotic devices with a newly created linear actuation mechanism, custom amplification, acquisition and DSP hardware, and embedded software algorithms. This new approach allows musicians to create expressive and reproducible musical performances with the instrument using consistent musical parameters, and the self-calibrating nature of the instrument lets users focus on creating music instead of maintaining equipment.}

Second, all parameters are "live" as usual, but turning one knob or setting a switch will also change the settings of other, statistically related controls.

This approach requires visual, auditory, haptic, and proprioceptive modalities, making it necessary to integrate technologies capable of providing such a multimodal environment. The prototype of the proposed system is implemented by combining Motion Capture, Spatial Audio, and Mixed Reality technologies. The system is evaluated in terms of objective measurements and tested with users through music improvisation sessions. The results demonstrate that the system is used as intended with respect to multimodal interaction for musical agents.

We also study the behaviour of autonomous swarmalators in the presence of one user-controlled agent, which we call the interactive swarmalator. We observed that sound frequencies barely deviate from their initial values when there are few agents, but they diverge significantly in a highly dense swarm. Additionally, with the inclusion of the interactive swarmalator, the group's behaviour tends to adjust towards it. We use these results to explore the potential of swarmalators in music performance under various scenarios.

"Sound animation" in this context means musical performance based on various modes of replay and transformation of all kinds of recorded music samples. Sound animation using Mono-Replay is a two-step process, including an off-line analysis phase and on-line performance or synthesis phase. The analysis phase proceeds with time segmentation, and the set up of anchor points corresponding to temporal musical discourse parameters (notes, pulses, events). This allows, at the performance phase, for control of timing, playback position, playback speed, and a variety of spectral effects, with the help of gesture interfaces. Animation principles and software features of Mono-Replay are described. Two examples of sound animation based on beat tracking and transient detection algorithms are presented (a multi-track record of Superstition by Steve Wonder and Jeff Beck and Accidents/Harmoniques, an electroacoustic piece by Bernard Parmegiani). With the help of these two contrasted examples, the fundamental principles of ``sound animation'' are reviewed: parameters of musical discourse, audio file segmentation, gestural control and interaction for animation at the performance stage.}

Considering that MIDI keyboard lacking information of force (acceleration) and fingering detection, both of which are important for expression, we designed force-sensor glove and achieved basic image recognition.

The Aesthetic Experience Prism makes use of Arthur Danto's framework of aesthetic experience that consists of three conceptual entities: (1) metaphor; (2) expression; and (3) style. In this paper we present key questions driving the research, theoretical background, artistic research approach and user research activities. In the DIYSE project a proof-of-concept music creation system prototype was developed in a collaborative design setting. The prototype provides means to the performer to create music with minimum effort while allowing for versatile interaction. We argue that by using an artistic research approach specifically targeting designing for aesthetic experience we were able to transform the knowledge from early design ideas to resulting technology products in which model's of interaction metaphors, expression and style are in an apparent role.},

However, most simple pop music follows a common chord progression pattern. This pattern applies to most simple pop music on all the 12 keys. We designed an app that can reduce the difficulty of music jamming on the keyboard by using this pattern. The app displays the current chord in the Roman numeral and suggests the expected next chord in an easy to understand way on a smartphone. This work investigates into the human computer interaction perspective of music performance. We use a smartphone app as a bridge, which assists musician to react faster in music jamming by transforming the complex music knowledge into a simple, unified and easy to understand format. Experiment result shows that this app can help the non-keyboardist musician to learn pop music jamming. It also shows that the app is useful to assist keyboardist in making key transpose and playing music in the key with many sharps and flats. We will use the same interface design to guide user on playing other chord progressions such as the jazz chord progression.}

  abstract = {Creating an artificially intelligent (AI) aid for music composers requires a practical and modular approach, one that allows the composer to manipulate the technology when needed in the search for new sounds. Many existing approaches fail to capture the interest of composers as they are limited beyond their demonstrative purposes, allow for only minimal interaction from the composer or require GPU access to generate samples quickly. This paper introduces Score-Transformer (ST), a practical integration of deep learning technology to aid in the creation of new music which works seamlessly alongside any popular software notation (Finale, Sibelius, etc.). Score-Transformer is built upon a variant of the powerful transformer model, currently used in state-of-the-art natural language models. Owing to hierarchical and sequential similarities between music and language, the transformer model can learn to write polyphonic MIDI music based on any styles, genres, or composers it is trained upon. This paper briefly outlines how the model learns and later notates music based upon any prompt given to it from the user. Furthermore, ST can be updated at any time on additional MIDI recordings minimizing the risk of the software becoming outdated or impractical for continued use.}

Since this app was designed to be a tool for scale practice, drone-like accompaniment was chosen so that musicians could experiment with combinations of melody and harmony. The details of the application development process are discussed in this paper, with the main focus on scale analysis and harmonic transposition. By using these two components, the application is able to dynamically alter key to reflect the user's playing.

Individuals interact with the installation by wearing a brainwave interface that measures the strength of the alpha wave signal. The interface then transmits the data to a computer that uses it in order to determine the individual's overall state of relaxation. As the individual achieves higher states of relaxation, mechatronic instruments respond and provide feedback. This feedback not only encourages self-awareness but also it motivates the individual to relax further. Visitors without the headset experience the installation by watching a film and listening to an original musical score. Through the novel arrangement of technologies and features, 'Where Is The Quiet?' demonstrates that mediated technological experiences are capable of evoking meditative states of consciousness, facilitating individual and group connectivity, and deepening awareness of the natural world. As such, this installation opens the door to future research regarding the possibility of immersive experiences supporting humanitarian needs.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a comparative analysis of four embedded platforms designed for real-time audio processing: Bela, Daisy, OWL, and Raspberry Pi. These platforms have become integral tools in the field of digital musical instrument design, offering a variety of workflows, programming environments, and deployment methods. Although each system carries its own distinct strengths and constraints, the current workflow to embed DSP code across multiple devices lacks standardized approaches. To address this challenge, we develop a methodology that focuses on deploying Pure Data patches across all four platforms. Our study is structured around four test patches. Our findings highlight the trade-offs in latency, processing power, and memory constraints across the selected platforms. As a result, we propose a streamlined workflow to deploy Pd patches on each board using Plugdata, the Heavy Compiler, and their respective Web IDEs. As an ongoing contribution to the NIME community, we document our methodologies, workflows, and best practices in an open source repository, which serves as a continuously evolving resource for future research in the hands of musicians, researchers, and developers working with embedded musical systems.}

MASD is currently verified by evaluating the time between sending beats or conductor information and this information being rendered for the musician. Future work includes user testing of this system. There are three major components to the MASD system. These components are Score Distribution, Score Rendering and Information Distribution. Score Distribution passes score information to clients and is facilitated by the Internet Communication Engine (ICE). Score Rendering uses the GUIDO Library to display the musical score. Information Distribution uses ICE and the IceStorm service to pass beat and instruction information to musicians.},

NIMEs are studied from a range of disciplines, such as musicology, engineering, human-computer interaction, psychology, design, and performance studies. Attempts to continue traditional organology classifications for electronic and digital instruments have been made, but with unsatisfactory results. This paper raises the problem of tree-like classifications of digital instruments, proposing an alternative approach: musical organics . Musical organics is a philosophical attempt to tackle the problems inherent in the organological classification of digital instruments. Shifting the emphasis from hand-coded classification to information retrieval supported search and clustering, an open and distributed system that anyone can contribute to is proposed. In order to show how such a system could incorporate third-party additions, the paper also presents an organological ontogenesis of three innovative musical instruments: the saxophone, the Minimoog, and the Reactable. This micro-analysis of innovation in the field of musical instruments can help forming a framework for the study of how instruments are adopted in musical culture.}

Through interviews with participants in a recent Feedback Musicianship Network symposium, this paper seeks to investigate the contemporary use of this technique and explore how key protagonists discuss the nature of their practice. We see common concepts emerging in these conversations: agency, complexity, coupling, play, design and posthumanism.

  abstract = {This study presents a framework for mapping audio information into simulated neural signals and dynamic control maps. The system is based on a biologically-inspired architecture that traces the sound pathway from the cochlea to the auditory cortex. The system transforms acoustic features into neural representations by integrating Meddis's Inner Hair-Cell (IHC) model with spiking neural networks (SNN).The mapping process occurs in three phases: the IHC model converts sound waves into neural impulses, simulating hair cell mechano-electrical transduction. These impulses are then encoded into spatio-temporal patterns through an Izhikevich-based neural network, where spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms enable the emergence of activation structures reflecting the acoustic information's complexity. Finally, these patterns are mapped into both EEG-like signals and continuous control maps for real-time interactive performance control.This approach bridges neural dynamics and signal processing, offering a new paradigm for sound information representation. The generated control maps provide a natural interface between acoustic and parametric domains, enabling applications from generative sound design to adaptive performance control, where neuromorphological sound translation explores new forms of audio-driven interaction.}

Performances with a prototype gestural performance system, Gestate, provide the basis for insights into the application of gestural systems in live contexts. These reflections stem from a performer's perspective, outlining the experience of prototyping and performing with augmented instruments that extend vocal or instrumental technique through ancillary gestures. Successful implementation of rapidly evolving gestural technologies in real-time performance calls for new approaches to performing and musicianship, centred around a growing understanding of the body's physical and creative potential. For musicians hoping to incorporate gestural control seamlessly into their performance practice a balance of technical mastery and kinaesthetic awareness is needed to adapt existing systems to their own purposes. Within non-tactile systems, visual feedback mechanisms can support this process by providing explicit visual cues that compensate for the absence of haptic or tangible feedback. Experience gained through prototyping and performance can yield a deeper understanding of the broader nature of gestural control and the way in which performers inhabit their own bodies.}

This means that it is usually underrepresented in existing data-driven deep learning models for fundamental frequency estimation. Furthermore, the steelpan has complex acoustic properties that make fundamental frequency estimation challenging when using deep learning models for general fundamental frequency estimation for any music instrument. Fundamental frequency estimation or pitch detection is a fundamental task in music information retrieval and it is interesting to explore methods that are tailored to specific instruments and whether they can outperform general methods. To address this, we present SASS, the Steelpan Analysis Sample Set that can be used to train steel-pan specific pitch detection algorithms as well as propose a custom-trained deep learning model for steelpan fundamental frequency estimation. This model outperforms general state-of-the-art methods such as pYin and CREPE on steelpan audio - even while having significantly fewer parameters and operating on a shorter analysis window. This reduces minimum system latency, allowing for deployment to a real-time system that can be used in live music contexts.}

Several causes could explain this reality, among them the lack of a proper instrumental technique, inadequacy of the traditional musical notation and the non-existence of a repertoire dedicated to the instrument. In this paper we present Entoa, the first written music for Intonaspacio, a DMI we designed in our research project. We propose some strategies for mapping data from sensors to sound processing, in order to accomplish an expressive performance. Entoa is divided in five different sections that corresponds to five movements. For each, a different mapping is designed, introducing subtle alterations that progressively explore the ensemble of features of the instrument. The performer is then required to adapt his repertoire of gestures along the piece. Indications are expressed through a gestural notation, where freedom is give to performer to control certain parameters at specific moments in the music.}

  abstract = {This paper describes the Genophone [2], a hyperinstrument developed for Sound-Performance-Design using the evolutionary paradigm of selective breeding as the driving process. Sound design, and control assignments (performance mappings), on most current systems rely heavily on an intimate knowledge of the Sound Synthesis Techniques (SSTs) employed by the sound generator (hardware or software based). This intimate knowledge can only be achieved by investing long periods of time playing around with sounds and experimenting with how parameters change the nature of the sounds produced. This experience is also needed when control mappings are defined for performance purposes, so external stimuli can effect changes in SST parameters. Often such experience can be gained after years of interaction with one particular SST. The system presented here attempts to aid the user in designing performance sounds and mappings without the necessity for deep knowledge of the SSTs involved. This is achieved by a selective breeding process on populations of individual sounds and their mapping. The initial populations are made up of individuals of existing hand-coded sounds and their mapping. Initial populations never have randomly derived individuals (this is not an issue as man's best friend was also not selectively bred from protozoa). The user previews the population then expresses how much individuals are liked by their relative repositioning on the screen (fitness). Some individuals are selected as parents to create a new population of offspring, through variable mutation and genetic recombination. These operators use the fitness as a bias for their function, and they were also successfully used in MutaSynth [1]. The offspring are then evaluated (as their parents were) and selected for breeding. This cycle continues until satisfactory sounds and their mapping are reached. Individuals can also be saved to disk for future "strain" development. The aim of the system is to encourage the creation of novel performance mappings and sounds with emphasis on exploration, rather than designs that satisfy specific a priori criteria.},

  abstract = {This paper presents two main ideas: (1) Various newly invented liquid-based or underwater musical instruments are proposed that function like woodwind instruments but use water instead of air. These ``woodwater'' instruments expand the space of known instruments to include all three states of matter: solid (strings, percussion); liquid (the proposed instruments); and gas (brass and woodwinds). Instruments that use the fourth state of matter (plasma) are also proposed. (2) Although the current trend in musical interfaces has been to expand versatililty and generality by separating the interface from the sound-producing medium, this paper identifies an opposite trend in musical interface design inspired by instruments such as the harp, the acoustic or electric guitar, the tin whistle, and the Neanderthal flute, that have a directness of user-interface, where the fingers of the musician are in direct physical contact with the sound-producing medium. The newly invented instruments are thus designed to have this sensually tempting intimacy not be lost behind layers of abstraction, while also allowing for the high degree of virtuosity. Examples presented include the poseidophone, an instrument made from an array of ripple tanks, each tuned for a particular note, and the hydraulophone, an instrument in which sound is produced by pressurized hydraulic fluid that is in direct physical contact with the fingers of the player. Instruments based on these primordial media tend to fall outside existing classifications and taxonomies of known musical instruments which only consider instruments that make sound with solid or gaseous states of matter. To better understand and contextualize some of the new primordial user interfaces, a broader concept of musical instrument classification is proposed that considers the states of matter of both the user-interface and the sound production medium.},

The CubeHarmonic is a musical application of the Rubik's cube, with notes on each little piece. Scrambling the cube, we get different chords and chord sequences. Positions of the pieces which contain LC coils are detected through IM3D, and transmitted to the computer, that plays sounds. The central position of the cube is also computed from the LC coils located into the corners of Rubik's cube, and, depending on the computed central position, we can manipulate overall loudness and pitch changes, as in theremin playing. This new instrument, whose first idea comes from mathematical theory of music, can be used as a teaching tool both for math (group theory) and music (music theory, mathematical music theory), as well as a composition device, a new instrument for avant-garde performances, and a recreational tool.},

The empty cells in the gridded object are filled with a fitting, colored object; the placement of which is analogous to adding an instrument or switching on a box in a step sequencer grid. The color and column position of every element in the matrix are used as parameters for a synthesizer while the row position of that element corresponds to the moment within the loop that entry is sounded. The two dimensional array can be positioned anywhere within the camera's visibility. Both the translation and rotation of the physical matrix are assigned to global parameters that affect the music while preserving the color and order of the cells. A rotation of 180 degrees, for example, will not reverse the sequence, but instead change an assigned global parameter.},

Drawing from the history of audience engagement in the arts and leveraging advancements in digital technology, we foster a dynamic and immersive interactive model that complements traditional musical conduction techniques. The performance was designed for a 270 degree concert hall which allows the audience to see each other. In this setting, by employing mobile phones not only as communication devices but as light emitters, we explore the symbiotic relationship among the various actors in a performance. To achieve that, we developed a computer vision system designed to translate the audience participation into shaping the sonic landscape of the performance. This process is underpinned by considerations of cybernetics and the feedback loop between human participants and technological systems, challenging conventional power structures within performance spaces. Through this work, we aim to expand the boundaries of interactive music creation, offering insights into the potential for technologically-facilitated audience entanglement and further the discussion with the context of music ecology.}

Prior research centered on using alternative CMIs to supplant laptops in ensemble settings is discussed, and the benefits of adopting the Norns Shield in service of democratizing and diversifying the music technology ensemble are demonstrated in a discussion centered on the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley New Music Ensemble's adoption of the instrument. A description of two software packages developed by the author showcases an extension of the instrument's abilities to share collaborative control data between internet-enabled CMIs and to remotely manage script launching and parameter configuration across a group of Norns Shields, providing resources for ensembles interested in incorporating the device into their ranks.}

Unlike a common loop pedal, each layer of sound in RL is produced by an intelligent looping-agent which adapts to the musician and respects given constraints, using constrained optimization. In its original form, RL worked well for jazz guitar improvisation but was unsuited to structured music such as pop songs. In order to bring the system on pop stage, we revisited the system interaction, following the guidelines of professional users who tested it extensively. We describe the revisited system which can accommodate both pop and jazz. Thanks to intuitive pedal interaction and structure-constraints, the new RL deals with pop music and has been already used in several in live concert situations.}

The system functions by sampling a performers input, processing or reshaping this sampled input, and then repeatedly replaying it. The degree to which the sampled control signal is processed during replay is adjustable in real-time by the manipulation of a continuous finger slider function. The reshaping algorithm uses stochastic methods commonly used for MIDI note generation from a provided dataset. The reshaped signal therefore varies in an unpredictable manner. In this way the Gestroviser is a device to capture, reshape and replay an instrumental gesture. We describe the result of initial user testing of the system and discuss possible further development.}

The system tries to challenge the boundaries between the concepts of composition, score, performance, instrument, since the musical result will depend both on the composed score and the way the navigators will traverse it during the live performance.},

Rather, all participants had equal say in what was to be done and how it was to be accomplished. Results show that the group learning environment is rich in opportunities for learning, mutual teaching, and for establishing a comunal practice for a given interactive musical system.Key findings suggest that learning by demonstration, observation and modelling are significant for learning in this context. Additionally, it was observed that a dialogue and a continuous flow of information between the members of the community is needed in order to motivate and further their learning.}

The main point of this paper proposes that beyond the initial motivation produced by new technologies and their artistic potential, there are many profound artistic considerations that drive the development and design of a work in unique ways. Thus, in the case of the Wave Duet, the produced buoys were prompted by investigating the relationship between sonic objects and natural phenomena. As a result, the mappings, physical and sound designs directly reflect these issues. Finally, it is also suggested that during the course of development, unintended issues may emerge and further inform how the work is perceived in a broader sense.}

Despite recent efforts to examine the main contributing factors of DMI falling into obsolescence, such attempts to remedy this issue largely place focus on the artifacts establishing themselves, their design processes and technologies. However, few existing studies have attempted to proactively build a community around technological platforms for DMIs, whilst bearing in mind the social dynamics and activities necessary for a budding community. We observe that such attempts while important in their undertaking, are limited in their scope. In this paper we will discuss that achieving some sort of longevity must be addressed beyond the device itself and must tackle broader ecosystemic factors. We hypothesize, that a longevous DMI design must not only take into account a target community but it may also require a non-traditional pedagogical system that sustains artistic practice.},

We explore this NIME topic in the context of building the first iteration of an augmented acoustic guitar prototype for percussive fingerstyle guitarists. The first author, himself a percussive fingerstyle player, started the project of an augmented guitar with expectations and assumptions made around his own playing style, and in particular around the arrangement of one song. This input was complemented by the outcome of an interview study, in which percussive guitarists highlighted functional and creative requirements to suit their needs. We ran a pilot study to assess the resulting prototype, involving two other players. We present their feedback on two configurations of the prototype, one equalising the signal of surface sensors and the other based on sample triggering. The equalisation-based setting was better received, however both participants provided useful suggestions to improve the sample-triggering model following their own auditory imagery.}

Its foundations lie in the use of the guitar's body for percussive lines, and in the extended range given by the novel use of altered tunings. There are very few formal accounts of percussive fingerstyle, therefore, we devised an interview study to investigate its approach to composition, performance and musical experimentation. Our aim was to gain insight into the technique from a gesture-based point of view, observe whether modern fingerstyle shares similarities to the approaches in NIME practice and investigate possible avenues for guitar augmentations inspired by the percussive technique. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis on the transcribed interviews: our findings highlight the participants' material-based approach to musical interaction and we present a three-zone model of the most common percussive gestures on the guitar's body. Furthermore, we examine current trends in Digital Musical Instruments, especially in guitar augmentation, and we discuss possible future directions in augmented guitars in light of the interviewees' perspectives.}

Based on our findings we provide a contemporary contextual overview of the activities happening in LATAM and the particular challenges that practitioners face emerging from their socio-political reality. We also offer LATAM perspectives on critical epistemological issues that affect the NIME community as a whole, contributing to a pluriversal view on these matters, and to the embracement of multiple realities and ways of doing things.}

Not every digital musical instrument seeks to create a close relationship between body and instrument, but even for the many that do, the design process often focuses heavily on technical and sonic factors, with relatively less attention to the bodily experience of the performer. In this paper we propose Somaesthetic design as an alternative to explore this space. The Soma method aims to attune the sensibilities of designers, as well as their experience of their body, and make use of these notions as a resource for creative design. We then report on a series of workshops exploring the relationship between the body and the guitar with a Soma design approach. The workshops resulted in a series of guitar-related artefacts and NIMEs that emerged from the somatic exploration of balance and tension during guitar performance. Lastly we present lessons learned from our research that could inform future Soma-based musical instrument design, and how NIME research may also inform Soma design.}

Rather than predicting symbolic music (e.g., MIDI notes), we suggest that predicting future control data from the user and precise temporal information can lead to new and interesting interactive possibilities. We propose that a mixture density recurrent neural network (MDRNN) is an appropriate model for this task. The predictions can be used to fill-in control data when the user stops performing, or as a kind of filter on the user's own input. We present an interactive MDRNN prediction server that allows rapid prototyping of new NIMEs featuring predictive musical interaction by recording datasets, training MDRNN models, and experimenting with interaction modes. We illustrate our system with several example NIMEs applying this idea. Our evaluation shows that real-time predictive interaction is viable even on single-board computers and that small models are appropriate for small datasets.}

We describe the artistic rationale for our artwork, the design of the two interaction schemes, and the technical and usability feedback that we have obtained from demonstrations during iterative development.

A systematic review of the last year's conference proceedings reveals that most papers do, indeed, present new instruments, interfaces, or pieces of technology. Comparably few papers focus on the prolongation of existing NIMEs. Our meta-analysis identifies four main categories from these papers: (1) reuse, (2) update, (3) complement, and (4) long-term engagement. We discuss how focusing more on these four types of NIME development and engagement can be seen as an approach to increase sustainability.}

To this end, we performed a systematic literature review of the NIME proceedings, analyzing papers in which scores play a central role. We analyzed the score not as an object per se but in relation to the users and the interactive system(s). In other words, we primarily looked at the role that scores play in the performance ecology. For this reason, to analyze the papers, we relied on ARCAA, a recent framework created to investigate artifact ecologies in computer music performances. Using the framework, we created a scheme for each paper and clustered the papers according to similarities. Our analysis produced five main categories that we present and discuss in relation to literature about musical scores.}

This idea builds upon the notion of graphic scores and composed instrument, and apply them in a new context. Our proposal also explores possible parallels between open meaning in interaction design, and aleatoric score, conceptualized as Open Work by the Italian philosopher Umberto Eco. Our approach has two aims. The first aim is to create an environment where users can immerse themselves in the visual elements of a score while listening to the corresponding music. The second aim is to facilitate users to develop a personal relationship with both the system and the score. To achieve those aims, as a practical implementation of our proposed concept, we developed two immersive scenarios: a 360º video and an interactive space. We conclude presenting how our design aims were accomplished in the two scenarios, and describing positive and negative elements of our implementations.}

In this paper, we investigate the issues of spatialization techniques for object-based audio production and introduce the Spatial Audio Design Spaces (SpADS) framework, that provides insights into the spatial manipulation of object-based audio. Based on interviews with professional sound engineers, this morphological analysis clarifies the relationships between recording and rendering techniques that define audio-objects for 3D speaker configurations, allowing the analysis and the design of advanced object-based controllers as well.}

This paper explores how a soft, textile-based interface can reshape human-AI interaction, particularly in musical co-creation. We introduce a textile-based human-AI system used both for musical performance and public interaction. This system enables embodied, tactile engagement with an AI agent, offering users a more unique and participatory experience in human-AI musical co-creation. We aim to examine the potential for soft materiality to mediate more dynamic human-AI interactions. Our findings reveal that users' choices when interacting with novel systems are informed by their expectations and biases, that embodied learning is built iteratively on layered multi-sensory experiences, and that there is a desire for familiarity and understanding when interacting with AI systems. We found that the materiality of our textile human-AI interfaces influenced how users choose to interact, and that users sought clarity in the AI's role in collaborative creation. This work contributes to our understanding of how entanglement, embodiment, and materiality impact our relationships in human-AI collaborations.}

Haptic technologies have seen significant advances in gaming, virtual reality training, and as an auxiliary output in select music performance and playback systems. However, there are currently no stand-alone haptic music/art systems that allow for the easy creation and distribution of haptic music/art. Despite the convergence of haptics research and music technology, the perspectives of the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) communities remain underrepresented in the field of creative haptic technology development. Recognizing the potential of more readily available haptic art creation and sharing systems for the Deaf and/or Disabled community, we conducted a co-design workshop with 27 DHH middle school children, focusing on their experiences with haptic vibrations, creating low-fidelity prototypes for haptic art presentation devices, and composing short pieces of haptic music. Through a mixed-methods analysis of survey responses, reflections, and thematic analysis of the prototypes and haptic art compositions, we gained valuable insights into the aesthetic possibilities and considerations for future haptic art instruments. By elevating haptic music/art as a distinct category of work not always subservient to auditory music, we hope to pave the way for more inclusive and accessible technologies in the realm of artistic expression and enrich the experiences of diverse communities in the world of art and creativity.}

The nerve sensor afforded the communication of gestural effort in a manner that other gestural instruments did not, while offering a smaller palette of reliably classifiable gestures.}

Inclusive music processes employ consumer controllers, computer access tools and/or specialized digital musical instruments (DMIs). The first category reveals a design ethos identified by the authors as artefact multiplication -- many sliders, buttons, dials and menu layers; the latter types offer ergonomic accessibility through artefact magnification. We present a prototype DMI that eschews artefact multiplication in pursuit of enhanced real time creative independence. We reconceptualise the universal click-drag interaction model via a single sensor type, which affords both binary and continuous performance control. Accessibility is optimized via a familiar interaction model and through customized ergonomics, but it is the mapping strategy that emphasizes transparency and sophistication in the hierarchical correspondences between the available gesture dimensions and expressive musical cues. Through a participatory and progressive methodology we identify an ostensibly simple targeting gesture rich in dynamic and reliable features: (1) contact location; (2) contact duration; (3) momentary force; (4) continuous force, and; (5) dyad orientation. These features are mapped onto dynamic musical cues, most notably via new mappings for vibrato and arpeggio execution.}

Despite offering rich and robust data output and multiple ways to interpret it, approaches towards using multi-touch technology in digit al musical inst rument design have been markedly conservative, showing a strong tendency towards modeling existing hardware. This not only negates many of the benefits of multi-touch technology but also creates specific difficulties in the context of live music performance. A case study of two other interface types that have seen considerable musical use --the XY pad and button grid --illustrates the manner in which the implicit characteristics of a device determine the conditions under which it will favorably perform. Accordingly, this paper proposes an alternative approach to multi-touch which emp hasizes the imp licit strengths of the technology and establishes a philosophy of design around them. Finally, we introduce two toolkits currently being used to assess the validity of this approach.},

By bringing contemporary live coding and ancient textile approaches together, we reach a common view of pattern as algorithmic movement (e.g. looping, shifting, reflecting, interfering) in the making of things. This works beyond the usual definition of pattern used in musical interfaces, of mere repeating sequences. We conclude by considering the place of algorithmic pattern in a wider activity of making.}

We compared two versions of the device, with and without the audio-inspired augmentations, with a group of artists who used each version over a one week period. Our results show that the use of audio-like controls afforded more immediate, direct and embodied control over the LLM, allowing users to creatively experiment and play with the device over it's non-mixer counterpart. Our project demonstrates how cross-sensory metaphors can support creative thinking and embodied practice when designing new technological interfaces.}

As a result, designers may assume that these seemingly omnipotent tools are pliable vehicles for the expression of musical ideas. We present the outcomes of a compositional game in which sound designers were invited to create simple instruments using common sensors and the Pure Data programming language. We report on the patterns and structures that often emerged during the exercise, arguing that designers respond strongly to suggestions offered by the tools they use. We discuss the idea that current music programming languages may be as culturally loaded as the communities of practice that produce and use them. Instrument making is then best viewed as a protracted negotiation between designer and tools.}

The approach uses low-latency feedback loops between software and analog hardware to expose the internal working of the instrument. Compared to the standard control voltage approach used on analog synths, alterations to the feedback loops produce distinctive and less predictable changes in behaviour with original artistic applications. This paper discusses the technical foundations of the approach, its roots in hacking and circuit bending, and case studies of its use in live performance with the D-Box hackable instrument.}

However, most of the studies that use physiology based interaction focus on single-user paradigms, and its usage in collaborative scenarios is still in its beginning. In this paper we explore how interactive sonification of brain and heart signals, and its representation through physical objects (physiopucks) in a tabletop interface may enhance motivational and controlling aspects of music collaboration. A multimodal system is presented, based on an electrophysiology sensor system and the Reactable, a musical tabletop interface. Performance and motivation variables were assessed in an experiment involving a test "Physio" group(N=22) and a control "Placebo" group (N=10). Pairs of participants used two methods for sound creation: implicit interaction through physiological signals, and explicit interaction by means of gestural manipulation. The results showed that pairs in the Physio Group declared less difficulty, higher confidence and more symmetric control than the Placebo Group, where no real-time sonification was provided as subjects were using pre-recorded physiological signal being unaware of it. These results support the feasibility of introducing physiology-based interaction in multimodal interfaces for collaborative music generation.},

The string-plate model is formulated in a way that prioritises its parametric explorability. Where the roles of creating performance gestures and designing instruments are traditionally separated, such a design provides a continuum across these domains. The string-plate model, its real-time implementation, and the control interface are described, and the system is preliminarily evaluated through informal observations of how musicians engage with the system.}

While the physical con figuration of the instrument builds on similar feedback string instruments being developed in recent years, this project focuses on modifying the feedback behaviour through low-level audio feature extractions coupled to computationally lightweight filtering and amplitude management algorithms. We discuss these adaptive and time-variant processing strategies and how we apply them in sculpting the system's dynamic and complex behaviour to our liking.}

This work led to the adaptation of common hardware to be used as a sensor attached to an acoustic instrument and the development of software applications to record, visualize and map performers gesture data into signal processing parameters. The scope of this work suggested that focus was to be made on a specific instrument so the saxophone was chosen. Gestures were selected in an iterative process with the performer, although a more ambitious strategy to figure out main gestures of an instruments performance was first defined. Detailed gesture-to-sound processing mappings are exposed in the text. An electroacoustic musical piece was successfully rehearsed and recorded using the Gest-O system.},

Moreover, the continuous nature of the IR sensors offers the controller a considerable degree of flexibility, indicating sig-nificant potential for the inclusion of extended and novel techniques for musical expression in the future.},

Inspired by the Tonnetz (a tonal diagram), we present a new layout of pitches defined using low-level harmonic notions. We demonstrate the potential of our system by mapping the random movements of fish in an aquarium to this layout. Qualitatively, we find that this captures the intuition behind mapping motion to sound. Similarly moving fish produce consonant chords, while fish moving in non-unison produce dissonant chords. We introduce an open source MATLAB library implementing these techniques, which can be used for sonifying multimodal streaming data.}

The risk of designing advanced instruments becoming debris quickly is real if longevity is not actively considered. In this paper, we present the process of redesigning a crafted DMI to fit a small-scale production process while considering strategies that render the final design more sustainable and maximize the object's lifespan. We present the results of a critical analysis of this process through a sustainability lens. From this analysis, we distilled a number of reflections that could help similar design processes or NIME crafting activities. The most innovative reflections are related to inscribing sustainability into the practice of using the instruments. From this perspective, we suggest considering the future user as a designer capable of fixing, adjusting, redesigning, or hacking the DMI and actively provide possible solutions that can significantly extend the lifespan of a DMI and, consequently, its sustainability.}

Additionally, a preliminary study is presented which aims to evaluate the potential of ASCIML as a tool for sound synthesis and to gather feedback and suggestions for future improvements. The prototype can be used in Google Colaboratory and is divided into four main stages: Data Design, Training, Evaluation and Audio Creation. Results from the study, which involved 27 musicians with no prior knowledge of Machine Learning (ML), showed that most participants preferred using microphone recording and synthesis to design their dataset and that the Envelopegram visualization was found to be particularly meaningful to understand sound datasets. It was also found that the majority of participants preferred to implement a pre-trained model on their data and relied on hearing the audio reconstruction provided by the interface to evaluate the model performance. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of ASCIML as a tool for hands-on neural audio sound synthesis and provides valuable insights for future developments in the field.}

We designed a musical interface with a unique large-scale layout to encourage new performers to create fully original instrument-body interactions. We conducted a study where trained musicians were invited to perform one of two versions of the same instrument, each physically identical but with a different tone mapping. The study results reveal insights into how musicians develop novel performance gestures when encountering a new instrument characterised by an unfamiliar shape and size. Our discussion highlights the impact of an instrument's scale and layout on the emergence of new gestural vocabularies and on the qualities of the music performed.}

The online open source development community has embraced the Wii remote, integrating the inexpensive technology into numerous applications. Some of the more interesting applications demonstrate how the remote hardware can be leveraged for nonstandard uses. In this paper we describe a new way of interacting with the Wii remote and sensor bar to produce music. The Wiiolin is a virtual instrument which can mimic a violin or cello. Sensor bar motion relative to the Wii remote and button presses are analyzed in real-time to generate notes. Our design is novel in that it involves the remote's infrared camera and sensor bar as an integral part of music production, allowing users to change notes by simply altering the angle of their wrist, and henceforth, bow. The Wiiolin introduces a more realistic way of instrument interaction than other attempts that rely on button presses and accelerometer data alone.},

These algorithms canthen either create continuous sound, or be used in instruments to play notes with specific start time and duration.We have written a base set of unit generators to enablea wide variety of synthesis options, and the capabilities ofthe unit generators, instruments, and Processing allow fora wide range of composition techniques.},

In recent years,several rare archives of early experimental electronic music have becomeavailable. The Daphne Oram Collection contains one such archive, consisting ofapproximately 120 hours of 1/4 inch tape recordings and representing a perioddating from circa 1957. This collection is recognized as an importantmusicological resource, representing aspects of the evolution of electronicmusic practices, including early tape editing methods, experimental synthesistechniques and composition. However, it is extremely challenging to derivemeaningful information from this dataset, primarily for three reasons. First,the dataset is very large. Second, there is limited metadata --- some titles,track lists, and occasional handwritten notes exist, but where this is true,the reliability of the annotations are unknown. Finally, and mostsignificantly, as this is a collection of early experimental electronic music,the sonic characteristics of the material are often not consistent withtraditional musical information. In other words, there is no score, no knowninstrumentation, and often no recognizable acoustic source. We present amethod for the construction of a frequency component dictionary derived fromthe collection via Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA), anddemonstrate how an interactive 3D visualization of the relationships betweenthe PLCA-derived dictionary and the archive is facilitating researcher'sunderstanding of the data.},

  abstract = {Wireless technology is growing increasingly prevalent in the development of new interfaces for live music performance. However, with a number of different wireless technologies operating in the 2.4 GHz band, there is a high risk of interference and congestion, which has the potential to severely disrupt live performances. With its high transmission power, channel bandwidth and throughput, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) presents an opportunity for highly robust wireless communications. This paper presents our preliminary work optimising the components of a Wi-Fi system for live performance scenarios. We summarise the manufacture and testing of a prototype directional antenna that is designed to maximise sensitivity to a performer's signal while suppressing interference from elsewhere. We also propose a set of recommended Wi-Fi configurations to reduce latency and increase throughput. Practical investigations utilising these arrangements demonstrate a single x-OSC device achieving a latency of {$<$}3 ms and a distributed network of 15 devices achieving a net throughput of 4800 packets per second ( 320 per device); where each packet is a 104-byte OSC message containing 16 analogue input channels acquired by the device.}

  abstract = {The purpose of this project is to develop an interface for writing and performing music using sequencers in virtual reality (VR). The VR sequencer deals with chance-based operations to select audio clips for playback and spatial orientation-based rhythm and melody generation, while incorporating three-dimensional (3-D) objects as omnidirectional playheads. Spheres which grow from a variable minimum size to a variable maximum size at a variable speed, constantly looping, represent the passage of time in this VR sequencer. The 3-D assets which represent samples are actually sample containers that come in six common dice shapes. As the dice come into contact with a sphere, their samples are triggered to play. This behavior mimics digital audio workstation (DAW) playheads reading MIDI left-to-right in popular professional and consumer software sequencers. To incorporate height into VR music making, the VR sequencer is capable of generating terrain at the press of a button. Each terrain will gradually change, creating the possibility for the dice to roll on their own. Audio effects are built in to each scene and mapped to terrain parameters, creating another opportunity for chance operations in the music making process. The chance-based sample selection, spatial orientation-defined rhythms, and variable terrain mapped to audio effects lead to indeterminacy in performance and replication of a single piece of music. This project aims to give the gaming community access to experimental music making by means of consumer virtual reality hardware.}

MOM combines a real-time signal processing engine implemented with Pure Data on an embedded Linux platform, with gestural interaction implemented via a variety of analog and digital sensors. Power, sound-input and sound-diffusion subsystems make the instrument autonomous and mobile. This instrument was designed in coordination with the development of an evening-length dance/music performance in which the performing musician is engaged in choreographed movements with the mobile instruments. The design methodology relied on a participatory process that engaged an interdisciplinary team made up of technologists, musicians, composers, choreographers, and dancers. The prototyping process relied on a mix of in-house and out-sourced digital fabrication processes intended to make the open source hardware and software design of the system accessible and affordable for other creators.},

We analyze the latency present in several current multi-touch platforms, and we describe a new custom system that reduces latency to an average of 30 ms while providing programmable haptic feed-back to the user.

  abstract = {Gugak, the traditional music of Korea, is defined by its distinctive musical characteristics, including flexible tuning, non-metric rhythms, and intricate ornamentation. These unique features, while artistically rich, pose significant challenges for novice learners, particularly when approached through conventional, textbook-based methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Audiation Development System for Gugak, an interactive platform that leverages algorithmic analysis to support both learning and teaching. Central to this system is the development of signal processing functions for rhythmic guidance, pitch detection, and additive harmonic synthesis---algorithms specifically designed to capture the expressive nuances of Gugak. These functions generate real-time auditory and visual feedback, providing a responsive learning environment aligned with the updated Korean music curriculum. The system not only enables student-centred exploration of Gugak's fluid structures but also supports educators through dynamic, visualized feedback tools. Beyond its technical foundation, this research sets the stage for future development of user interfaces and investigates the educational efficacy of computer-driven learning compared to traditional methods. By integrating music technology and pedagogy, this work contributes to both the accessibility and sustainability of Korea's musical heritage.}

Coupled oscillators implemented with multiple agents can be used at an analytic level with different types of parametric space, and complex behavior depends on each coupling value of the group and each agent's relationship. It can be exploited at various levels of settings in the composition and sound synthesis stages. I outline the way of sound synthesis through the simulation of Janus network oscillators to find the meaning of compositional techniques underlying the self-organized principles.}

Describing the close and persistent interactions between organisms of different species, symbioses manifest across a spectrum of relationship types, each identified according to the health effect experienced by the engaged organisms. This biological taxonomy is appropriated within a framework which identifies specific modes of interaction between sound and movement according to the collaborating practitioners' intended outcome, and required provisions, cognition of affect, and system operation. Using the symbiotic framework as an analytical tool, six dancer-musician collaborations from the field of NIME are examined in respect to the employed modes of interaction within each of the four examined areas. The findings reveal the emergence of multiple modes in each work, as well as examples of mutation between different modes over the course of a performance. Furthermore, the symbiotic concept provides a novel understanding of the ways gesture recognition technologies (GRTs) have redefined the relationship dynamics between dancers and musicians, and suggests a more efficient and inclusive approach in communicating the potential and limitations presented by Human-Computer Interaction tools.}

These case studies can inspire DMI designers when creating their instruments so that barriers to performance can be eliminated. Furthermore, the findings underscore the necessity for composers to create documentation with comprehensive information, facilitating a thorough understanding for performers of both the instrument's manipulations and their artistic vision.}

  abstract = {On several acoustic and electromechanical keyboard instruments, the produced sound is not always strictly dependent exclusively on a discrete key velocity parameter, and minute gesture details can affect the final sonic result. By contrast, subtle variations in articulation have a relatively limited effect on the sound generation when the keyboard controller uses the MIDI standard, used in the vast majority of digital keyboards. In this paper we present an embedded platform that can generate sound in response to a controller capable of sensing the continuous position of keys on a keyboard. This platform enables the creation of keyboard-based DMIs which allow for a richer set of interaction gestures than would be possible through a MIDI keyboard, which we demonstrate through two example instruments. First, in a Hammond organ emulator, the sensing device allows to recreate the nuances of the interaction with the original instrument in a way a velocity-based MIDI controller could not. Second, a nonlinear waveguide flute synthesizer is shown as an example of the expressive capabilities that a continuous-keyboard controller opens up in the creation of new keyboard-based DMIs.}

We contacted 97 DMI makers that presented a new instrument at five successive editions of NIME (2010-2014); 70 answered. They were asked to indicate the original motivation for designing the DMI and to present information about its uptake. Results confirmed that most of the instruments have difficulties establishing themselves. Also, they were asked to reflect on the specific factors that facilitated and those that hindered instrument longevity. By grounding these reflections on existing reserach on NIME and HCI, we propose a series of design considerations for future DMIs.}

The paper presents three ways that the signal from the pick can modulate the guitar sound, followed by a case study of its use in which 11 guitarists tested the Magpick for five days and composed a piece with it. Reflecting on their comments and experiences, we outline the innovative features of this technology from the point of view of performance practice. In particular, compared to other augmentations, the high temporal resolution, low latency, and large dynamic range of the Magpick support a highly nuanced control over the sound. Our discussion highlights the utility of having the locus of augmentation coincide with the locus of interaction.}

So, what are the typical characteristics of NIMEs and what are their roles in performers' practice? Is there a typical NIME repertoire? This paper aims to address these questions with a bottom up approach. We reflect on the answers of 78 NIME performers to an online questionnaire discussing their performance experience with NIMEs. The results of our investigation explore the role of NIMEs in the performers' practice and identify the values that are common among performers. We find that most NIMEs are viewed as exploratory tools created by and for performers, and that they are constantly in development and almost in no occasions in a finite state. The findings of our survey also reflect upon virtuosity with NIMEs, whose peculiar performance practice results in learning trajectories that often do not lead to the development of virtuosity as it is commonly understood in traditional performance.},

Failing to do so would result in an unintentional but tacit acceptance and support of such ideologies. We explore one item to be included in this political agenda: the recent trend in music technology of ``democratising music'', which carries implicit political ideologies grounded in techno-solutionism. We conclude with a number of recommendations for stimulating community-wide discussion on these themes in the hope that this leads to the development of an outward-facing perspective that fully engages with political topics.}

Links are suggested between the sonic affordances of each instrument and the dynamical mechanisms embedded in them. This is discussed in the context of contemporary, materialoriented approaches to composition and particularly to free improvisation where elements such as unpredictability and instability are often of interest, and the process of exploration and discovery is an important part of the practice. Links are also made with the use of dynamical interactions in computer games to produce situations in which slight variations in the timing and ordering of inputs can lead to very different outcomes, encouraging similarly explorative approaches.}

General practicalities of mapping sonic elements to physical forces areconsidered, such as the problem of representing detailed data through vaguephysical sensation, approaches to applying forces to the hand that do notinterfering with the smooth operation of the device, and the relative merits ofdiscreet and continuous mappings. Three approaches to generating the forcevector are discussed: 1) the use of simulated detents to identify areas of anaudio parameter over a certain threshold, 2) applying friction proportional tothe level of the audio parameter along the axis of movement, and 3) creatingforces perpendicular to the subject's hand movements.Presentation of audio information in this manner could be beneficial for`pre-feeling' as a method for selecting material to play during a liveperformance, assisting visually impaired audio engineers, and as a generalaugmentation of standard audio editing environments.},

The research draws on twenty two artist interviews conducted by the authors, and on magazine and forum archives. We focus particularly on how the properties of the no-input mixer connect with the musical, aesthetic and practical concerns of these practices. The affordability, accessibility, and non-hierarchical nature of the instrument are examined as factors that help the idea spread, and that can be important political dimensions for artists. The material, social and cultural aspects are brought together to provide a detailed picture of the instrument that goes beyond technical description. This provides a useful case study for NIME in thinking through these intercon- nections, particularly in looking outwards to how musical instruments and associated musical ideas travel, and how they can effect change and be changed themselves in their encounters with real-world musical contexts.}

Particularly in situations with acoustic instruments this perspective can provide insight into the often cumbersome relation between the --technology orientated-- sound engineer and the --music orientated-- performer. Playing a musical instrument (whether acoustic, electric or electronic) involves navigating often complicated but very precise interfaces. The interface for sound amplification technology in a certain environment is not limited to the control surface of a mixing desk but includes the interaction with other stakeholder, i.e. the performers and the choice of loudspeakers and microphones and their positions. As such this interface can be as accurate and intimate but also as complicated as the interfaces of 'normal' musical instruments. By zooming in on differences between acoustic and electronic sources a step is taken towards inclusion in this discussion of the perception of amplified music and the possible influence of that amplification on performance practise.},

Since 1965, EEG has been used in a large number of, sometimes highly sophisticated, systems for musical and artistic expression. However, since the advent of the synthesizer, most such systems have utilized digital and/or synthesized media in sonifying the EEG signals. There have been relatively few attempts to create interfaces for musical expression that allow one to mechanically manipulate acoustic instruments by modulating one's mental state. Secondly, few such systems afford a distributed performance medium, with data transfer and audience participation occurring over the Internet. The use of acoustic instruments and Internet-enabled communication expands the realm of possibilities for musical expression in Brain-Computer Music Interfaces (BCMI), while also introducing additional challenges. In this paper we report and examine a first demonstration (Music for Online Performer) of a novel system for Internet-enabled manipulation of robotic acoustic instruments, with feedback, using a non-invasive EEG-based BCI and low-cost, commercially available robotics hardware.},

Such a technique is useful for robots consisting of many strings: the ability to self-tune allows for long-term installation without human intervention as well as on-the-fly tuning scheme changes. The presented method consists of comparing a detuned string's pitch at runtime to a pre-compiled table of string responses at varying tensions. The behavior of the current detuned string is interpolated from the two nearest pre-characterized neighbors, and the desired virtual fret positions are added to the interpolated model. This method allows for rapid tuning at runtime, requiring only a single string actuation to determine the pitch. After a detailed description of the self-tuning technique and implementation, the results will be evaluated on the new Swivel 2 robotic slide guitar. The paper concludes with a discussion of performance applications and ideas for subsequent work on self-tuning musical robotic systems.}

However, a creator may know a good mapping when they encounter it yet start with little sense of what the inputs or outputs should be. We call this an open-ended mapping process. Addressing this need, we introduce the latent mapping, which leverages the latent space of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm such as a Variational Autoencoder trained on a corpus of unlabelled gestural data from the creator. We illustrate it with Sonified Body, a system mapping full-body movement to sound which we explore in a residency with three dancers.}

  abstract = {This is a report of research and some experimental applications of human-computer interaction in multi-media performing arts. The human performer and the computer systems perform computer graphic and computer music interactively in real-time. In general, many sensors are used for the interactive communication as interfaces, and the performer receives the output of the system via graphics, sounds and physical reactions of interfaces like musical instruments. I have produced many types of interfaces, not only with physical/electrical sensors but also with biological/physiological sensors. This paper is intended as an investigation of some special approaches: (1) 16-channel electromyogram sensor called ``MiniBioMuse-III'' and its application work called ``BioCosmicStorm-II'' performed in Paris, Kassel and Hamburg in 2001, (2) sensing/reacting with ``breathing'' in performing arts, (3) 8-channel electric-feedback system and its experiments of ``body-hearing sounds'' and ``body-listening to music''.}

  abstract = {In this paper, I would like to introduce my experimental study of multimedia psychology. My initial focus of investigation is the interaction between perceptions of auditory and visual beats. When the musical and graphical beats are completely synchronized with each other, as in a music video for promotional purposes, the audience feels that they are natural and comforting. My initial experiment has proved that the actual tempos of music and images are a little different. If a slight timelag exists between the musical and pictorial beats, the audience tries to keep them in synchronization by unconsciously changing the interpretation of the time-based beat points. As the lag increases over time, the audience seems to perceive that the beat synchronization has changed from being more downbeat to more upbeat, and continues enjoying it. I have developed an experiment system that can generateand control out-of-phase visual and auditory beats in real time, and have tested many subjects with it. This paper describes the measurement of time lags generated in the experiment system, as part of my psychological experiment.}

We developed this tool to have an easier learning curve, and a low barrier of entry. xrOSC is an isotonic mixed reality controller interface with six degrees of freedom and direct absolute input designed for standalone extended reality devices. By utilizing hand tracking and gestural control, we can enable more natural and intuitive positioning of sound sources in 3D audio spatialization of the external composed space, as opposed to using spatialization tools on a traditional 2D display with mouse/keyboard input methods. This software is designed specifically as a control method, as there is no processing done on the device. xrOSC simply sends control messages over the network to a spatialization backend using the Open Sound Control protocol. This paper discusses the design process and methodological considerations in order to develop a tool for composers to more easily create spatial-considered musical compositions.}

In addition, participants can change master/slave role between performers immediately. Our primary motivation is to provide musicians and nonmusicians with opportunities to experience a collaborative electronic music performance. Here, the hardware and interaction design of the device is presented. To date, numerous collaborative musical instruments have been developed in electronic music field [1][2][3]. The authors are interested in formations of musical sessions using stand-alone devices and leader/follower relationship in musical sessions. The authors specify three important requirements of instrument design for musical session. They are as follows: (1) Simple Interface: Interface that enables performers to control three sound elements (pitch, timbre, and amplitude) with simple interaction. (2) Portable Stand-alone System: System that runs standalone (with sound generators, speakers, and butteries). Because musical sessions can be improvised at any place and time, the authors consider that portability is essential in designing musical instruments for sessions. (3) Wireless Synchronization: System that supports ensembles by automatically synchronizing tempo (BPM) and tonality between multiple devices by air because of portability. In addition, performers can switch master/slave roles smoothly such as leader/follower relationship during a musical session. The authors gave ten live performances using this device at domestic and international events. In these events, the authors confirmed that our proposed wireless synchronization system worked stable. It is suggested that our system demonstrate the practicality of wireless synchronization. In future, the authors will evaluate the device in terms of its stability in multi-performer musical sessions.}

Generally, it is difficult for nonmusicians toachieve this kind of smooth changing depends on levels of their skillacquisition.

The approach presented uses realtime machine vision applied to a live video feed of a scene, from which detected objects and people are fed into Manhattan (Nash, 2014), a digital music notation that integrates sequencing and programming to support the live creation of complex musical works that combine static, algorithmic, and interactive elements. The paper discusses the technical details of the system and artistic development of specific musical works, introducing novel techniques for mapping chaotic systems to musical expression and exploring issues of agency, aesthetic, accessibility and adaptability relating to composing interactive music for crowds and public spaces. In particular, performances as part of an installation for BBC Music Day 2018 are described. The paper subsequently details a practical workshop, delivered digitally, exploring the development of interactive performances in which the audience or general public actively or passively control live generation of a musical piece. Exercises support discussions on technical, aesthetic, and ontological issues arising from the identification and mapping of structure, order, and meaning in non-musical domains to analogous concepts in musical expression. Materials for the workshop are available freely with the Manhattan software.}

Following the paradigm of spreadsheets, an established model of end-user programming, Manhattan is designed to bridge the gap between traditional music editing methods (such as MIDI sequencing and typesetting) and generative and algorithmic music -seeking both to reduce the learning threshold of programming and support flexible integration of static and dynamic musical elements in a single work. Interaction draws on rudimentary knowledge of mathematics and spreadsheets to augment the sequencer notation with programming concepts such as expressions, built-in functions, variables, pointers and arrays, iteration (for loops), branching (goto), and conditional statements (if-then-else). In contrast to other programming tools, formulas emphasise the visibility of musical data (e.g. notes), rather than code, but also allow composers to interact with notated music from a more abstract perspective of musical processes. To illustrate the function and use cases of the system, several examples of traditional and generative music are provided, the latter drawing on minimalism (process-based music) as an accessible introduction to algorithmic composition. Throughout, the system and approach are evaluated using the cognitive dimensions of notations framework, together with early feedback for use by artists.}

In the keyboard, additional hardware combines existing scan code (key press) data with accelerometer readings to create a secondary USB device, using the same cable but visible to software as a separate USB MIDI device aside existing USB HID functionality. This paper presents and evaluates an initial prototype, developed using an Arduino board and inexpensive sensors, and discusses design considerations and test findings in musical applications, drawing on user studies of keyboard-mediated music interaction. Without challenging more established (and expensive) performance devices; significant benefits are demonstrated in notation-mediated interaction, where the user's focus rests with software.},

Therapy sessions take the form of ``musical ensembles'' comprised of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), typically led by one or more certified music therapists. VESBALL had been developed in close consultation with therapists, clients, and other stakeholders, and had undergone several phases of trials at a music therapy facility over a period of 6 months. VESBALL has an advantage over other related work in terms of its robustness, ease of operation and setup (for clients and therapists), sound source integration, and low cost of production. The authors hope VESBALL would positively impact the conditions of individuals with ASD, and pave way for new research in custom-designed NIME for communities with specific therapeutic needs.}

To this end we propose a design approach that not only considers the materiality of the instrument, but that leverages it as a central part of the conception of the sonic quality, the control structuring and what generally falls under the umbrella of "mapping" design. As we will discuss, this extended computational matter-centric view is of benefit towards holistically understanding an ``instrument'' gestural engagement, as it is realized through physical material, sonic gestural matter and felt human engagement. We present instrumental systems that have arisen as a result of this approach to instrument design.}

Cadavid deconstructs colonial understandings of the Andean device known as the khipu, pulling apart the academic view of khipus as artifacts to be deciphered, the strict delineation between administrative and ritualistic uses of the khipu, and the separation of the oral tradition from the object. Through deliberate design choices and musical expression in performance, Cadavid emphasizes the inextricability of coding, art, and ritual by creating a tactile device that re-tells history and challenges the false oppositional binary between Indigeneity and technology. Understanding this project of digital lutherie as an act of creation through hacking - specifically as the deconstruction and reconfigurement of artistic and historical components, utilizing scholars Astrida Neimani's and V\'it Bohal's definitions - allows us to appreciate its power.}

Instrumentalists come to the question of interactivity with a whole array of gestures, sounds and associations already in place, so must choose carefully the means by which the instrumental performance is augmented. Frances-Marie Uitti [2] is a pioneer in the field, creating techniques to amplify the cellist's innate performative gestures and in parallel developing the instrument. This paper intends to give an overview of the author's work in developing interactivity in piano performance, mechanical augmentation of the piano and possible structural developments of the instrument to bring it into the twenty-first century.},

For this application, a live performance was conducted with the CVC module and the possibilities as a new interface for musical expression were examined.}

  abstract = {The T-Stick, an interface with a lifetime of nearly 17 years, has undergone multiple changes over time. Over the first decade and a half of its existence, the T-Stick was manufactured in various sizes (four) and copies ({$>$} 30 units). Despite the relatively large numbers in the context of in-house academic interfaces, over the past 6 years many T-Sticks were made fairly artisanally, with graduate students manufacturing their own devices. Despite this strategy's clear pedagogical advantages, the reliability of these devices was not always a priority, leading to the need for repairs and downtime during use. In this paper, we present the design for the 5th generation of T-Sticks, the T-Stick 5GW, designed to improve the reliability and maintainability of the interface to reduce faults during extended periods of use dramatically. The main changes in this new generation are the use of a custom-made ESP32-S3 board, which integrates a fuel gauge and IMU. In addition, the touch sensor is printed on a flexible PCB and interfaces with the touch board using a 32-pin FFC connector, dramatically reducing the need for soldering parts. Requirements relating to the instrument's reliability/availability and manufacturing are described in detail and were evaluated analytically, showing the effectiveness of the new design. Further reliability testing is ongoing through the use of the latest generation in musical performances.}

Though all musical instruments can eventually break, managing how they are going to be fixed and built within a research organisation can help with the continued usage of the instrument. We apply reliability analysis techniques to estimate the reliability, availability and maintainability characteristics of the T-Stick. Using these characteristics we estimate the amount of spare parts needed to maintain a 99\% availability target for the T-Stick. This analysis provides insights on expected maintenance time, costs, and personnel needed when supporting and building DMIs.}

Olly uses one Bare touch board in midi mode and four stretch analog sensors embedded inside four elastic ribbons. These ribbons top the main body of the installation which is made by using an inflatable gym ball wrapped in felt. Each of the ribbons plays a different instrument and triggers different harmonic chords. Olly allows to play pleasant melodies if interacting with it in solo mode and more complex harmonies when playing together with others. Results show great potentials for carefully designed musical TUI implementation aimed at scaffolding social play while affording self-regulation in SEN contexts.

The challenges of representing high-level data flow abstractions, including higher order functions, are described. The tension between abstraction and spontaneity in programming is addressed, and gradual abstraction in live programming is proposed as a potential solution. Several novel user interactions for patching on a touch device are shown. In addition, the paper describes some of the current issues of web audio music applications and offers strategies for integrating a web-based presentation layer with a low-latency native processing backend.}

  abstract = {Ever since the initiating workshop at the 2001 ACM CHI'01 Conference, annual New Interfaces for Musical Expression conferences have seen a proliferation of work featuring different forms of music, research values, philosophical, ethical and political standpoints. The 2025 `Entangled' theme celebrates this diversity of creative, technical, and social `intelligencings' (Thrift [68, p153-154]). It is precisely the non- or pluri-paradigmatic character of NIME that is its strength. Drawing on Maria Lugones [41], we characterise NIME less as an entangled weave---where threads maintain their separate yet assembled and interconnected character---than as a `curdling' where relationships are more complex, varied, mutually interrupting and shaping, indeterminate and unknown without careful dialogue. We do not consider it appropriate to offer unifying frameworks or mappings with often hidden authoritarian implications. Rather, following Ranci\`ere [5], we prefer a radically democratic dissensus and, following Lugones, a spirit of `festive resistance' where we poke at the limits of our inherited metaphors to undermine attempts to provide a fixed orderliness, (re)framing topics to kickstart exchange on new fertile grounds for collaboration. Multiple kinds and collisions of agency, and the lively openness of what some might deem `failure' are prioritised over the often inhibiting closure and certainty of `success' [e.g. 10, 11, 12, 40]. Our topics include: multiple ways of making as a means of maximising exposure to possible failure; shifting from interfaces to interfacing to create arenas for action rather than tools for purposes; foregrounding risk, inefficiency and forgetting; formulating improvisation as knowing-when and composing-the-now; performance practice, settings and contingencies; alternative resourcings/reframings for research; a wild spirit of tactical oppositionalism, dynamic uncompromise, and existential pluralism, to embrace the independence of divergent voices.}

The paper describes the design process, technical details and how a musician can use the instrument. The clarinet bell is extended with sensor technology in order to improve the ways the clarinet is traditionally played and improve the performing artist's musical and performative expressions. New ways of performing music with a clarinet also opens up for novel ways of composing musical pieces. The design is iterated in two versions with improved hardware and form factor where everything is packaged into the clarinet bell. The clarinet uses electronics that wirelessly sends sensor data to a computer that processes a live audio feed via the software MAX 7 and plays it back via loudspeakers on the stage. The extended clarinet provides several ways of transforming audio and also adds several ways of making performances more visually interesting. It is shown that this way of using sensor technology in a traditional musical instrument adds new dimensions to the performance and allows creative persons to express themselves in new ways as well as giving the audience an improved experience.},

With this method we can correctly localize 80 \textbackslash pm 9 \% of the percussive gestures. The user can assign determined pitches to specific positions and change the pitch palette in real time. The tactile feedback characteristic of every surface opens a set of new playing strategies and possibilities specific to any chosen object. The advantages of such a system are the affordable production, flexibility of concert location, object-specific musical instruments, portability, and easy setup.}

An essential contribution of this interface is the possibility of reconfiguration of the buttons layout without the need to hard rewire the system since it uses only the smartphone built-in camera. This features allow for quick instrument customisation for different use cases, such as low cost projects for schools or instrument building workshops. Our case study used the Sibilim for music education, where it was designed to develop the conscious of music perception and to stimulate creativity through exercises of short tonal musical compositions.

The creative applications employ various approaches and metaphors for scaling time, but also machine learning for recognising patterns.

To facilitate this low-overhead tempo synchronization, we propose the Global Metronome, which is a simple, computationally cheap method to obtain absolute tempo synchronization. We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of using the Global Metronome and compare the performance to MIDI clock sync, a common synchronization method. Finally, we present an open source implementation of a Global Metronome server using a GPS-connected Raspberry Pi that can be built for under \$100.},

Such a system would allow two percussionists to playin perfect synchrony despite the delays caused by computer networks. Toinvestigate the feasibility of such an approach, we record vibraphone malletstrikes with a high-speed camera and track the mallet head position. We showthat 30 ms before the strike occurs, it is possible to predict strike time andvelocity with acceptable accuracy. Our method fits a second-order polynomial tothe data to produce a strike time prediction that is within the bounds ofperceptual synchrony, and a velocity estimate that will enable the soundpressure level of the synthesized strike to be accurate within 3 dB.},

The interaction allows human performers to have full control over the melodic, harmonic, and expressive elements of the instrument while mechanical actuators excite and dampen the string with a rhythmic pattern. Guitarists can still access the fretboard without the physical interference of a mechatronic system, so they can play melodies and chords as well as perform bends, slides, vibrato, and other expressive techniques. Leveraging the capabilities of mechanical actuators, the mechanized hammers can output complex rhythms and speeds not attainable by humans. Furthermore, the rhythmic patterns can be algorithmically or stochastically generated by the hammer, which supports real-time interactive improvising.}

The progress of the Game of Life is controlled with a clock defined by the performer to configure the groove of the music.

  abstract = {The Sound Tree Project investigates how accessible digital musical instruments (ADMIs) can champion both personal and collective musical expression. Through a sustained six-month ethnographic engagement with five performers and two support artists, we explored how to create personalised instruments for a public performance outcome. The technical framework combined multiple wireless motion sensor devices placed inside different objects and the development of a real-time movement-to-sound processing hub within a live coding environment. The performance was centred on an accessible sound sculpture, the Sound Tree, where digital instruments coexisted with traditional sound making objects. Drawing from our shared process of experimentation, improvisation, and personalised instrument creation, we present some key `magic moments' that were woven into the final performance and discuss how they might serve as evidence of personal expression and validation of the design process. The emergence of these moments demonstrate the value of real-time system adaptation in encouraging individual expression, the importance of sustained engagement in developing personalised instruments and having effective strategies for balancing personal and collective music-making.These insights have implications in developing accessible music technology and broader approaches to designing technologies that support diverse forms of creative collaboration.}

  abstract = {Video games and music have influenced each other since the beginning of the consumer video game era. In particular the chiptune genre of music uses sounds from 8-bit video games; these sounds have even found their way into contemporary popular music. However, in this genre, game sounds are arranged using conventional musical interfaces, meaning the games themselves (their algorithms, design and interactivity) play no role in the creation of the music. This paper describes a new way of creating music with 8-bit games, by reverse engineering and augmenting them with run-time scripts. A new API, Emstrument, is presented which allows these scripts to send MIDI to music production software. The end result is game-derived musical interfaces any computer musician can use with their existing workflow. This enhances prior work in repurposing games as musical interfaces by allowing musicians to use the original games instead of having to build new versions with added musical capabilities. Several examples of both new musical instruments and dynamic interactive musical compositions using Emstrument are presented, using iconic games from the 8-bit era.},

The composition employs game audio and instrument design techniques to ensure each performance is unique and responsive.

The paper presents narrative frameworks that guide interactive compositions as well as a method of manipulating Logic X's linear DAW behaviours to create real-time compostions with low learning curves and fast auditioning times.

In this paper I address this question drawing on my expe- rience in learning several very different types of sophisticated instruments: the Glove Talk II real-time gesture-to-speech interface, the Digital Marionette controller for virtual 3D puppets, and pianos and keyboards. As the primary user of the first two systems, I have spent hundreds of hours with Digital Marionette and Glove-Talk II, and thousands of hours with pianos and keyboards (I continue to work as a professional musician). I will identify some of the under- lying principles and approaches that I have observed during my learning and playing experience common to these instru- ments. While typical accounts of users learning new inter- faces generally focus on reporting beginner's experiences, for various practical reasons, this is fundamentally different by focusing on the expert's learning experience.},

However, room exists for a standalone application with a simpler graphical user interface for dynamically patching between inputs and outputs. This paper presents an early prototype version of a software tool that allows the user to route control signals in real time, using various messaging formats. It is cross-platform and runs as a standalone application in desktop and Android OS versions. The latter allows the users of mobile devices to experiment with mapping signals to and from physical computing components using the inbuilt multi-touch screen.

Another goal of this work is wider platform accessibility for players, via a simple `do-it-yourself' approach described by the design herein. While the hardware and software elements are open source, the build process can nonetheless require non-insignificant investments of time and money, as well as basic electronics construction skills. These have been kept to a minimum wherever possible. Our initial prototype is based upon an inexpensive electric violin that is widely available online for approximately \$200 USD. This serves as the starting point for construction, to which the design adds local Digital Signal Processing (DSP), gestural sensing, and sound output. Real-time DSP algorithms are running on a mobile device, which also incorporates orientation/gesture sensors for parameter mapping, with the resulting sound amplified and rendered via small loudspeakers mounted on the instrument. The platform combines all necessary elements for digitally-mediated interactive performance; the need for a traditional computer only arises when developing new DSP algorithms for the platform. An initial exploratory evaluation with users is presented, in which performers explore different possibilities with the proposed platform (various DSP implementations, mapping schemes, physical setups, etc.) in order to better establish the needs of the performing artist. Based on these results, future work is outlined leading towards the development of a complete quartet of instruments.}

This practice develops alongside our juggling skills, creating a reciprocal relationship between designing a musical interface and learning how to use it. We first review some of the existing perspectives on error and failure in the arts. We then discuss the technical implementation of our NIME in terms of hardware, software, and sound design. Finally, we offer insights into the role of failure in our practice; first, as an unintentional artifact of learning how to juggle, then as a performative medium that we leverage for musical effect.}

Now suggests a desire of becoming present in the resonating sound field of our immediate environment. The energy in the field constantly modulates and drifts. I draw on voices and forces from the natural environment, humans and machines. The work seeks to draw the listeners into an inner space in which they can be both present and aware of their sonic environment and become immersed in it.

The actual action-sounds are captured with a piezoelectric transducer and processed in Max 8 to extend the sonic range existing in the acoustical domain alone. The control parameters are captured by the Morph and mapped to audio algorithm proprieties like filter cutoff frequency, frequency shift or overdrive. The instrument opens up the possibility for a large selection of different interaction techniques that have a direct impact on the output sound. The instrument is evaluated from a sound designer's perspective, encouraging exploration in the materials used as well as techniques. The contribution are two-fold. First, the use of a piezo transducer to augment the Sensel Morph affords an extra dimension of control on top of the offerings. Second, the use of acoustic sounds from physical interactions as a source for excitation and manipulation of an audio processing system offers a large variety of new sounds to be discovered. The methodology involved an exploratory process of iterative instrument making, interspersed with observations gathered via improvisatory trials, focusing on the new interactions made possible through the fusion of audio-rate inputs with the Morph's default interaction methods.}

The result was a modular system consisting of several VST plug-ins, which on the one hand provides a drum interface to create sounds and tones and on the other hand generates or manipulates music through dance movement, in order to simplify the understanding of more abstract characteristics of music. This paper describes the development of a new software concept for the prototype, which since then has been further developed and evaluated several times. This will improve the maintainability and extensibility of the system and eliminate design weaknesses. To do so, the existing system first will be analyzed and requirements for a new framework, which is based on the concepts of event driven architecture and dependency injection, will be defined. The components are then transferred to the new system and their performance is assessed. The approach chosen in this case study and the lessons learned are intended to provide a viable solution for solving similar problems in the development of modular VST-based NIMEs.},

The bass clarinet is augmented using a loudspeaker placed on the bell and a supercardiod microphone placed inside the instrument's body, allowing for the generation of feedback that is subsequently processed by a computational system to create new sound material. This feedback loop creates a symbiotic relationship between the performer and the electronics, resulting in the co-creation of the final piece, with the performer and the electronics influencing each other. The result is a unique and ever-evolving musical experience that poses interesting challenges to the traditional instrument--electronics and composer--opera relationship. This paper reports on both the hardware and software augmentation of the bass clarinet, and presents "WYPYM - Were you a part of your mother?", a piece written especially for this augmented instrument and its feedback system.}

  abstract = {The tabla is a traditional pitched two-piece Indian drum set, popular not only within South East Asian music, but whose sounds also regularly feature in western music. Yet tabla remains an aural tradition, taught largely through a guru system heavy in custom and mystique. Tablas can also pose problems for school and professional performance environments as they are physically bulky, fragile, and reactive to environmental factors such as damp and heat. As part of a broader project to demystify tabla, we present an electronic tabla that plays nearly identically to an acoustic tabla and was created in order to make the tabla acces- sible and practical for a wider audience of students, pro- fessional musicians and composers. Along with develop- ment of standardised tabla notation and instructional educational aides, the electronic tabla is designed to be compact, robust, easily tuned, and the electronic nature allows for scoring tabla through playing. Further, used as an interface, it allows the use of learned tabla technique to control other percussive sounds. We also discuss the technological approaches used to accurately capture the localized multi-touch rapid-fire strikes and damping that combine to make tabla such a captivating and virtuosic instrument.}

Three main percussive instrument designs were executed using a combination of force sensitive resistors, piezos, and capacitive sensing. While the instrument interfaces are designedto play interchangeably with the original, the sound andt ravel possiblilities they enable are tremendous. MIDI enables a massive new sound palette with new scales beyond the quirky traditional tuning and non-traditional sounds. It also allows simplified transcription for an aurally taught tradition. Significantly, it reduces the transportation challenges of a previously large and heavy ensemble, creating opportunities for wider audiences to experience Gong Kebyar's enchanting sound. True to the spirit of oneness in Balinese music, as one of the first large all-MIDI ensembles, ElekTrika challenges performers to trust silent instruments and develop an understanding of highly intricate and interlocking music not through the sound of the individual, but through the sound of the whole.},

In comparison, the hands have shown an impressive ability to mastercomplex motor tasks through feel. The hand controller uses both modes ofinteraction. Electro-magnetic field tracking enables 6D hand motion trackingwhile two options provide tactile interaction- a set of tracks that providelinear positioning and applied finger pressure, or a set of trumpet like sliderkeys that provide continuous data describing key depth. Thumbs actuateadditional pressure sensitive buttons. The two haptic interfaces are mountedto a comfortable hand grip that allows a significant range of reach, andpressure to be applied without restricting hand movement highly desirable inexpressive motion.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a multi-modal approach to musical instrument pitch tracking combining audio and position sensor data. Finger location on a violin fingerboard is measured using resistive sensors, allowing rapid detection of approximate pitch. The initial pitch estimate is then used to restrict the search space of an audio pitch tracking algorithm. Most audio-only pitch tracking algorithms face a fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and latency, with longer analysis windows producing better pitch estimates at the cost of noticeable lag in a live performance environment. Conversely, sensor-only strategies struggle to achieve the fine pitch accuracy a human listener would expect. By combining the two approaches, high accuracy and low latency can be simultaneously achieved.}

  abstract = {NIME has recently seen critique emerging around colonisation of music technology, and the need to decolonise digital audio workstations and music software. While commercial DAWs tend to sideline musical styles outside of western norms (and even many inside too), viewing this problem through an historical lens of imperialist legacies misses the influence of a more recent - and often invisible - hegemony that bears significant direct responsibility: The culture of technological development. In this paper we focus on the commercial technological development culture that produces these softwares, to better understand the more latent reasons why music production software ends up supporting some music practices while failing others. By using this lens we can more meaningfully separate the influence of historic cultural colonisation and music tech development culture, in order to better advocate for and implement meaningful change. We will discuss why the meaning of the term ``decolonisation'' should be carefully examined when addressing the limitations of DAWs, because while larger imperialist legacies continue to have significant impact on our understanding of culture, this can direct attention away from the techno-cultural subset of this hegemony that is actively engaged in making the decisions that shape the software we use. We discuss how the conventions of this techno-cultural hegemony shape the affordances of major DAWs (and thereby musical creativity). We also examine specific factors that impact decision making in developing and evolving typical music software alongside latent social structures, such as competing commercial demands, how standards are shaped, and the impact of those standards. Lastly, we suggest that, while we must continue to discuss the impact of imperialist legacies on the way we make music, understanding the techno-cultural subset of the colonial hegemony and its motives can create a space to advocate for conventions in music software that are more widely inclusive.}

  abstract = {When designing an augmented acoustic instrument, it is often of interest to retain an instrument's sound quality and nuanced response while leveraging the richness of digital synthesis. Digital audio has traditionally been generated through speakers, separating sound generation from the instrument itself, or by adding an actuator within the instrument's resonating body, imparting new sounds along with the original. We offer a third option, isolating the playing interface from the actuated resonating body, allowing us to rewrite the relationship between performance action and sound result while retaining the general form and feel of the acoustic instrument. We present a hybrid acoustic-electronic violin based on a stick-body electric violin and an electrodynamic polyphonic pick-up capturing individual string displacements. A conventional violin body acts as the resonator, actuated using digitally altered audio of the string inputs. By attaching the electric violin above the body with acoustic isolation, we retain the physical playing experience of a normal violin along with some of the acoustic filtering and radiation of a traditional build. We propose the use of the hybrid instrument with digitally automated pitch and tone correction to make an easy violin for use as a potential motivational tool for beginning violinists.}

Through an iteration of prototypes, we have designed an embedded proto-instrument that allows a bodily interaction between the performer and the virtual-acoustic plate in a way that redirects from the perception of the Sensel as a touchpad and reframes it as a percussive surface. Due to the computational effort required to run such a rich physical model and the necessity to provide a natural interaction, the audio processing is implemented on a high powered single board computer. We describe the design challenges and report on the technological solutions we have found in the implementation of Vodhr\'an which we believe are valuable to the wider NIME community.}

The construction of isomorphic instruments, beyond limited square isomorphisms present in many stringed instruments, has been a challenge in the past for two reasons: The first problem, that of re-arranging note actuators from their sounding elements, has been solved by digital instrument design. The second, more conceptual problem, is that only a single isomorphism can be designed for any one instrument, requiring the instrument designer (as well as composer and performer) to "lock in" to a single isomorphism, or to have a different instrument for each isomorphism in order to experiment. Musix (an iOS application) and Rainboard (a physical device) are two new musical instruments built to overcome this and other limitations of existing isomorphic instruments. Musix was developed to allow experimentation with a wide variety of different isomorphic layouts, to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each. The Rainboard consists of a hexagonal array of arcade buttons embedded with RGB-LEDs, which are used to indicate characteristics of the isomorphism currently in use on the Rainboard. The creation of these two instruments/experimentation platforms allows for isomorphic layouts to be explored in waysthat are not possible with existing instruments.},

However, the education of oral music genres, traditionally reliant on live demonstration and imitation, is undergoing a contrasting transformation by rapidly embracing online means. This study explores challenges in the embodied aspects of synchronous distance Hindustani music pedagogy, with a special focus on tactility. Taking an ethnomusicological perspective, the paper presents an analysis of interviews with Hindustani music practitioners, which is guided by the principles of the 4E Cognition framework. The findings suggest that, while the adaptation to technology aims to broaden access to music content, it does so at the expense of limiting opportunities for multi-modal interaction among participants. The results highlight constraints in conveying non-verbal, embodied, and multi-sensory cues, as well as disruptions in visual and acoustic, but most importantly tactile elements, that contribute to an otherwise shared spatial and physical context. These challenges hinder meaningful interaction and immersive experiences, crucial elements in music education. The study expresses concerns about the appropriateness of conventional videoconferencing platforms and offers valuable insights for developing alternative technologies, better suited to meet the embodied demands of these pedagogical practices.}

Through the lens of curated research, working together with a provocative brief, we explored handmade objects, craft, non-craft, human error, and the spirit of DIY, DIYness. We used the Studio Bench - a method that brings making, recording and performance together in one space - and viewed workshopping and performance as a holistic event. A range of methodologies were investigated in relation to NIME. These included the Hardware Mash-up, Speculative Sound Circuits and Reverse Design, from product to prototype, resulting in the instrument the Radical Nails. Finally, our work drew on the notion of design as performance and making in public and further developed our understanding of workshop-installation and performance-installation.}

Furthermore, it allows one to have an effective control over the sound, and consequently achieve great musical expression. In addition, a method for calibrating the multimedia digital instrument, devised to overcome the lack of a reliable reference point of the accelerometer and a process to obtain a video score are presented. This instrument has been used in a number of concerts (Portugal and Brazil) so as to test its robustness.},

We present a pipeline for deploying neural networks in the Bela embedded hardware platform. In our pipeline, we include a tool to record a multichannel dataset of sensor signals. Additionally, we provide a dockerised cross-compilation environment for faster compilation. With this pipeline, we aim to provide a template for programmers and makers to prototype and experiment with neural networks for real-time embedded musical applications.}

In controlled laboratory experiments, electrodermal activity (EDA) has been traditionally used to measure fluctuations of musical emotion. EDA is, however, ill-suited for real-world settings (e.g., live concerts) because of its sensitivity to movement, electronic noise and variations in the contact between the skin and the recording electrodes. The CHILLER, based on the Raspberry Pi architecture, overcomes these limitations by using a well-known algorithm capable of detecting goosebumps from a video recording of a patch of skin. The CHILLER has potential applications in both academia and industry and could be used as a tool to broaden participation in STEM, as it brings together concepts from experimental psychology, neuroscience, physiology and computer science in an inexpensive, do-it-yourself device well-suited for educational purposes.}

The Sonic Wings were developed using found speakers inside cardboard-made acoustic waveguides, a microcomputer accessed remotely, and a portable audio interface connected to a clippable microphone. Mounted to the performer's body, this system allows the performer to move freely while playing and interacting with the device across a performance space in which audiences stand and move spontaneously. This study's approach to interactions with body-mounted interfaces in musical performance challenges notions of control introducing notions of companionship. Engaging with the figure of the cyborg as proposed by Haraway, this paper discusses how the development of such device unfolds the embodiment of hybrid ontologies through musical performance enabling interactions with audiences through movement across an acoustically evolving space.}

We adapt the Co-Explorer (a software tool originally developed for musical co-creation) to audiovisual immersive contexts and examine its creative potential using a reflexive research-creation approach. Our study reveals how IRL splits the role of the performer into three distinct positions: (1) the designer, who defines the parametric space; (2) the guide, who reinforces the agent's behavior; and (3) the machine performer, whose actions are shaped by interactive training. As IRL introduces agency into the creative process, it transforms traditional notions of authorship and control, enabling unexpected emergent outcomes. By showcasing an interactive installation/performance, we further explore how audiences contribute to collective creation through reinforcement-based interaction. Our findings underscore the challenges of balancing the temporality of IRL with the demands of public-facing works and of adapting RL-based systems to different exhibition contexts. Our work contributes to the discourse on co-creative systems, emphasizing the evolving roles of artists, artificial agents, and audiences in hybrid creative ecosystems.}

It explores the various mapping organizations between controller and sound, giving different spaces of representation for the visual feedback. It can be either an amplification of the controller parameters, or a representation of the related musical parameters. Different examples of visualization are presented and evaluated, taking the Cantor Digitalis as a support. It appears the representation of musical parameters, little used compared to the representation of controllers, received a good opinion from the audience, highlighting the musical intention of the performers.}

The music composer creates beforehand musical elements such as melodic patterns, sound patterns, instruments, group of instruments, and a dynamic score that governs the way the basic elements will behave according to events produced by the audience. During the concert or the performance, the audience, by interacting with the system, gives birth to an original music composition. Skini music scores are expressed in terms of constraints that establish relationships between instruments. A constraint maybe instantaneous, for instance one may disable violins while trumpets are playing. A constraint may also be temporal, for instance, the piano cannot play more than 30 consecutive seconds. The Skini platform is implemented in Hop.js and HipHop.js. HipHop.js, a synchronous reactive DLS, is used for implementing the music scores as its elementary constructs consisting of high level operators such as parallel executions, sequences, awaits, synchronization points, etc, form an ideal core language for implementing Skini constraints. This paper presents the Skini platform. It reports about live performances and an educational project. It briefly overviews the use of HipHop.js for representing score.}

Although the use of music is developing in a range of contexts such as choirs, song writing groups, and more specific therapies, these often rely on musical knowledge or the expertise of facilitators. Limited tools are available which facilitate unguided musical experiences, fostering agency for their users through musical creativity. We present a workshop-based study exploring the use of a procedural music platform designed for those living with dementia and cognitive decline. The paper takes a mixed-methods approach, exploring a range of procedural processes, and reviewing participant engagement during their use. We demonstrate the use of the platform and highlight its potential for engagement. We evaluate the techniques implemented and demonstrate an inverse relationship between operational complexity and interaction. We conclude it is possible to facilitate engaging musical interactions which foster agency and creativity while maintaining rich and age-appropriate outputs.}

Within a field which often promotes out of the box thinking and new interactions with experimental technologies, how do we design for user groups where these notions of interaction will be less familiar, and/or increasingly challenging due to the progression of cognitive decline? The relationship between age and the use of technology is understood within the wider context of human computer interaction (HCI), however, how this applies specifically to musical interaction or contributes to a `dementia-friendly' approach to digital musical instrument (DMI) design is drastically underrepresented within the NIME community. Following a scoping review of technology for arts activities designed for older adults with cognitive decline, we ran a series of involvement activities with a range of stakeholders living with, or caring for those living with dementia. Consolidating the knowledge and experience shared at these events, we propose five considerations for designing dementia-friendly digital musical instruments. We illustrate our approach with a range of new instruments co-designed to enable increased interaction with music for people living with dementia.}

Existing research investigates the use of gesture, physical interaction and subsequent parameter mapping. We suggest that a tacit knowledge of the `sensor layer' brings with it definitions, understandings and expectations that forge and guide our approach to interaction. We argue that the influence of technology starts before a sound is made, and comes from not only intuition of material properties, but also received notions of what technology can and should do. On encountering an instrument with obvious sensors, a potential performer will attempt to predict what the sensors do and what the designer intends for them to do, becoming influenced by a machine centered understanding of interaction and not a solely material centred one. The paper presents an observational study of interaction using non-functional prototype instruments designed to explore fundamental ideas and understandings of instrumental interaction in the digital realm. We will show that this understanding influences both gestural language and ability to characterise an expected sonic/musical response.},

Chordophone designs have taken multiple forms, from frames that play a guitar-like instrument, to machines that integrate strings and actuators as part of their frame. However, few of these instruments have taken advantage of dynamics, which have been largely unexplored. This paper details the design and construction of a new picking mechanism prototype which enables expressive techniques through fast and precise movement and actuation. We have adopted iterative design and rapid prototyping strategies to develop and refine a compact picker capable of creating dynamic variations reliably. Finally, a quantitative evaluation process demonstrates that this system offers the speed and consistency of previously existing picking mechanisms, while providing increased control over musical dynamics and articulations.}

A computer program created for this composition runs on a laptop computer in front of the percussionist. The software captures sound from the contact microphone and transforms this sound through audio signal processing controlled by the performer's gestures on the iPad. The computer screen displays an animated graphic score, as well as the current states of iPad controls and audio signal processing, for the performer.

This research compared three approaches to capturing hand gestures where the shape of the hand, i.e. the relative positions and angles of finger joints, are an important part of the gesture. A number of sensor types can be used to capture information about hand posture, each of which has various practical advantages and disadvantages for music applications. This study compared three approaches, using optical, inertial and muscular information, with three sets of 5 hand postures (i.e. static gestures) and gesture recognition algorithms applied to the device data, aiming to determine which methods are most effective.},

Data for the study was collected from six post-secondary music students, consisting of recordings of scales covering the entire range of the cello. Comprehensive spectral audio analysis was performed on the data set in order to evaluate features suitable to describe tone quality. An inverse relationship was found between the harmonic centroid and pitch played, which became more pronounced when restricted to the A string. In addition, a model for predicting the harmonic centroid at different pitches on the A string was created.

Well established research shows a fetus in the womb can respond to and benefit from stimuli from the outside world. A musical instrument designed for this unique context can leverage the power of this interaction. Two prototypes were constructed and tested during separate pregnancies and the experiences are presented, and the limitation of the sensor technology identified. We discuss our discoveries about design considerations and challenges for such an instrument, and project thought-provoking questions that arise from its potential applications.}

  abstract = {The Chimaera is a touch-less, expressive, polyphonic and electronic music controller based on magnetic field sensing. An array of hall-effect sensors and their vicinity make up a continuous 2D interaction space. The sensors are excited with Neodymium magnets worn on fingers. The device continuously tracks position and vicinity of multiple present magnets along the sensor array to produce event signals accordingly. Apart from the two positional signals, an event also carries the magnetic field polarization, a unique identifier and group association. We like to think of it as a mixed analog/digital offspring of theremin and trautonium. These general-purpose event signals are transmitted and eventually translated into musical events according to custom mappings on a host system. With its touch-less control (no friction), high update rates (2-4kHz), its quasi-continuous spatial resolution and its low-latency ({$<$}1 ms), the Chimaera can react to most subtle motions instantaneously and allows for a highly dynamic and expressive play. Its open source design additionally gives the user all possibilities to further tune hardware and firmware to his or her needs. The Chimaera is network-oriented and configured with and communicated by OSC (Open Sound Control), which makes it straight-forward to integrate into any setup.}

The HASGS system was intended to retain focus on the performance of the acoustic instrument, keeping gestures centralised within the habitual practice of the instrument, and reducing the use of external devices to control electronic parameters in mixed music. Taking a reduced approach, the technology chosen to prototype HASGS was developed in order to serve the aesthetic intentions of the pieces being written for it. This strategy proved to avoid an overload of solutions that could bring artefacts and superficial use of the augmentation processes, which sometimes occur on augmented instruments, specially prototyped for improvisational intentionality. Here, we discuss how the repertoire, hardware, and software of the system can be mutually affected by this approach. We understand this project as an empirically-based study which can both serve as a model for analysis, as well provide composers and performers with pathways and creative strategies for the development of augmentation processes.}

Designed with 4 key principles - portability, hybridity, simplicity and low latency - the instrument allows for a fluid interplay between physical and real-time digital augmentation. Equipped with piezoelectric sensors, an FSR, and a DSP algorithm the drum extends its sonic landscape while preserving its acoustic presence. The design maintains an organic relationship between physical interaction and digital processing, and the three potentiometers provide intuitive yet flexible control, maintaining a balance between minimalism and expressivity. The bela platform ensures very low latency (7.55 \textpm{} 0.13 ms), making it highly responsive for live performance.User evaluation highlights its potential for expressive control and seamless hybrid performance while suggesting ergonomic and functional refinements. Future enhancements, such as feedback control and DSP presets, could deepen the entanglement between performer, instrument, and sound. This research explores the intersection of acoustic and digital sound, contributing to the design of hybrid instruments that blur the boundaries between physical resonance and electronic transformation, expanding possibilities for musical interaction.}

The system automatically assigns IDs to performers/users as they enter the tracking area, but when occlusion of a performer occurs, or when a user exits and then re-enters the tracking area, upon rediscovery of the user the system generates a new tracking ID. Because of this any assigned and registered target tracking points for specific users are lost, as are the linked abilities of that performer to control media based on their movements. We describe a single camera system for overcoming this problem by assigning IDs based on the colours worn by the performers, and then using the colour tracking for updating and confirming identification when the performer reappears after occlusion or upon re-entry. A video link is supplied showing the system used for an interactive dance work with four dancers controlling individual audio tracks.}

This tendency of AI art to bring forth the uncanny, emerging also in my design and performative work with NIMEs, echoes the methods of an artistic movement known as sonic hauntology. In this paper I elaborate on Derrida's and Fisher's notion of hauntology, a theoretical framework investigating ontology's liminalities, and an artistic current addressing the paradoxes of postmodern aesthetics through the magnification of the technological uncanny. I then apply this paradigm to creative AI, arguing that the model's algorithmic manipulation of the training data reproduces and exponentially accelerates the processes of temporal and semantic flattening that characterise postmodern aesthetics. The frictions produced by creative AI as it operates with and within the culture bring forth hauntological disjunctures, that artists might harness as an instrument of critique, and scholars as a novel epistemic method. Finally, I introduce AI hauntography, a practice-based methodology combining artistic practice and observation to investigate the phenomenological aspects of creative AI as they intersect with the broader technical and sociopolitical discourse.}

Despite the uptake of autoencoders in NIME design, little research has been done to characterize the latent spaces of audio models, and to investigate their affordances in practical musical scenarios. In this paper we present Stacco, an instrument specifically designed for the intuitive control of neural audio synthesis latent parameters through the displacement of magnetic objects on a wooden board with four magnetic attractors. We then examine models trained on the same data with different seeds, we explore strategies for more consistent mappings from audio to latent space, and propose a method for stitching the latent space of one model to another. Finally, in a user study, we investigate whether and how these techniques are perceived through embodied practice with Stacco.}

This work outlines the implementation of one such application in the form of an assistance tool designed for live improvisational performances by laptop ensembles. The primary intention was to leverage off-the-shelf pre-trained NN models as a basis for assisting individual performers either as musical novices looking to engage with more experienced performers or as a tool to expand musical possibilities through new forms of creative expression. The system expands upon a variety of ideas found in different research areas including new interfaces for musical expression, generative music and group performance to produce a networked performance solution served via a web-browser interface. The final implementation of the system offers performers a mixture of high and low-level controls to influence the shape of sequences of notes output by locally run NN models in real time, also allowing performers to define their level of engagement with the assisting generative models. Two test performances were played, with the system shown to feasibly support four performers over a four minute piece while producing musically cohesive and engaging music. Iterations on the design of the system exposed technical constraints on the use of a JavaScript environment for generative models in a live music context, largely derived from inescapable processing overheads.}

To that end, we propose a taxonomy of interactions in sequencer-based music performances of electronic music. We identify two performance modes sequencing and sound design and four interaction classes creation, modification, selection, and evaluation. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of the different interaction classes on both, musicians as well as the audience and use the proposed taxonomy to analyze six commercially available hardware devices.}

Such interface is designed to be coupled with a software counterpart for sound generation. The project originates from a collaboration with two composers from diverse cultural backgrounds - one Chinese and one Italian. Through collaborative design and co-composing practice, the proposed DMI emerged as an epistemic tool, promoting cultural understanding and critically highlighting the socio-cultural role of technology. Through such process, the significance of rediscovering time in contemporary globalization and philosophy was explored, challenging the conception of time as a mere measurement parameter and striving to reveal the importance of understanding the role of time across different cultural contexts. This project wishes to expand the constitutive role of musical time, demonstrating its diversity and prompting a reflective layer of the perception of performative and musical time in NIME.}

Droned sounds are played by sustaining the flame and beats by generating sparks and fast flames. The pitch of every sound can be changed moving the flame vertically in the air. This is achieved by using a custom computer vision system as an interface which maps the real-time the data extracted from the flame and transmits those parameters to the sound generator. As a result, the flame visual dynamics are deeply connected to the aural perception of the sound - `the sound seems to be burning'. This process establishes a metaphor dramaturgically engaging for an audience.

Our system supports musical improvisation between human performers and automated systems responding to the BCI. We explore the performers' roles during two performances when these socio-technical systems were implemented, in terms of coordination, problem-solving, managing uncertainty and musical responses to system constraints. This allows us to consider how features of these systems and practices might be incorporated into a general tool, aimed at any musician, which could scale for use in different performance settings involving interactive media.}

The device was created to augment the existing functions of the electric bass and explore the use of ancillary gestures to control the laptop in a live performance. In this research it was found that incorporating ancillary gestures into a live performance could be useful when controlling the parameters of audio processing, sound synthesis and video manipulation. These ancillary motions can be a practical solution to gestural multitasking allowing independent control of computer music parameters while performing with the electric bass. The process of performing with the Bass Sleeve resulted in a greater amount of laptop control, an increase in the amount of expressiveness using the electric bass in combination with the laptop, and an improvement in the interactivity on both the electric bass and laptop during a live performance. The design uses various gesture-to-sound mapping strategies to accomplish a compositional task during an electro acoustic multimedia musical performance piece.},

We discuss a method for capturing and selecting the wavetables, the implementation on an embedded platform (Bela Mini), and the trade-offs between realistic sound and computational efficiency. The synthesizer runs in real-time and has a polyphony of approximately 12 voices, allowing for an autonomously sounding electronic instrument.}

Sound sources are represented as colored spheres in a graphical user interface to provide the user with visual feedback. Moving sources back and forward controls volume, while left to right controls panning. To provide broader accessibility, the interface is configured to control mixing within the Ableton Live DAW.

We present a case study of five microphenomenological interviews conducted with musicians about their experiences with existing digital musical instruments. The interviews reveal deep, clear descriptions of different modalities of synchronic moments in interaction, especially in tactile connections and bodily sensations. We highlight the elements of interaction captured in these interviews which would not have been revealed otherwise and the importance of these elements in researching perception, understanding, interaction, and performance with digital musical instruments.}

Digital musical interfaces based on the voice have typically used indirect control, in which features extracted from audio signals control the parameters of sound generation, for example in audio to MIDI controllers. By contrast, focusing on the musculature of the singing voice allows direct muscular control, or alternatively, combined direct and indirect control in an augmented vocal instrument. In this way we aim to both preserve the intimate relationship a vocalist has with their instrument and key timbral and stylistic characteristics of the voice while expanding its sonic capabilities. This paper discusses other digital instruments which effectively utilise a combination of indirect and direct control as well as a history of controllers involving the voice. Subsequently, a new method of direct control from physiological aspects of singing through sEMG and its capabilities are discussed. Future developments of the system are further outlined along with usage in performance studies, interactive live vocal performance, and educational and practice tools.}

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of designing audio and vibrotactile effects simultaneously by interpolating audio-haptic control spaces. An inverse radial basis function method is used to dynamically create a mapping from a two-dimensional space to a many-dimensional control space for multimodal effects based on user-specified control points. Two proofs of concept were developed focusing on modifying the same structure across modalities and parallel structures.}

MIGSI uses sensor technology to capture gestural data such as valve displacement, hand tension, and instrument position, to offer extended control and expressivity to trumpet players. Several streams of continuous data are transmitted wirelessly from MIGSI to the receiving computer, where MIGSI Mapping application (a simple graphical user interface) parses the incoming data into individually accessible variables.

While results of this review confirm patterns such as the prominence of short-term, performer perspective evaluations, and the variety of evaluation strategies used, they also show that UX-focused evaluations are typically exploratory and limited to novice performers. Overall, these patterns indicate that current UX evaluation strategies do not address dynamic factors such as skill development, the evolution of the performer-instrument relationship, and hedonic and cognitive aspects of UX. To address such limitations, we discuss a number of less common tools developed within and outside of NIME that focus on dynamic aspects of UX, potentially leading to more informative and meaningful evaluation insights.}

  abstract = {Physical modelling sound synthesis methods generate vast and intricate sound spaces that are navigated using meaningful parameters. Numerical based physical modelling synthesis methods provide authentic representations of the physics they model. Unfortunately, the application of these physical models are often limited because of their considerable computational requirements. In previous studies, the CPU has been shown to reliably support two-dimensional linear finite-difference models in real-time with resolutions up to 64x64. However, the near-ubiquitous parallel processing units known as GPUs have previously been used to process considerably larger resolutions, as high as 512x512 in real-time. GPU programming requires a low-level understanding of the architecture, which often imposes a barrier for entry for inexperienced practitioners. Therefore, this paper proposes HyperModels, a framework for automating the mapping of linear finite-difference based physical modelling synthesis into an optimised parallel form suitable for the GPU. An implementation of the design is then used to evaluate the objective performance of the framework by comparing the automated solution to manually developed equivalents. For the majority of the extensive performance profiling tests, the auto-generated programs were observed to perform only 60\% slower but in the worst-case scenario it was 50\% slower. The initial results suggests that, in most circumstances, the automation provided by the framework avoids the lowlevel expertise required to manually optimise the GPU, with only a small reduction in performance. However, there is still scope to improve the auto-generated optimisations. When comparing the performance of CPU to GPU equivalents, the parallel CPU version supports resolutions of up to 128x128 whilst the GPU continues to support higher resolutions up to 512x512. To conclude the paper, two instruments are developed using HyperModels based on established physical model designs.}

  abstract = {The design of digital musical instruments represents a complex role that incorporates creative practice, design and engineering. It is, of course, a deep discussion topic and research focus within the NIME community. This paper discusses how digital luthiers approach design through a reflexive thematic analysis that inductively explores their practice. This work builds on a study that includes interviews with 27 digital luthiers from various backgrounds and varied motivations, originally motivated to better understand tool use in digital lutherie. The themes presented provide constructed narratives that affirm assumptions that intuitively appear likely and provide interesting insights and developments for further exploration that are fitting and relevant to the NIME community. This discussion finds nuances in how digital luthiers approach design, both as a problem and in search of inspiration. It also explores how interaction and control are often the primary focus of digital luthiers and that they emphasise opinionated and directed design choices. These ideas are then considered in relation to existing ideas from the field.}

  abstract = {General-Purpose GPU computing is becoming an increasingly viable option for acceleration, including in the audio domain. Although it can improve performance, the intrinsic nature of a device like the GPU involves data transfers and execution commands which requires time to complete. Therefore, there is an understandable caution concerning the overhead involved with using the GPU for audio computation. This paper aims to clarify the limitations by presenting a performance benchmarking suite. The benchmarks utilize OpenCL and CUDA across various tests to highlight the considerations and limitations of processing audio in the GPU environment. The benchmarking suite has been used to gather a collection of results across various hardware. Salient results have been reviewed in order to highlight the benefits and limitations of the GPU for digital audio. The results in this work show that the minimal GPU overhead fits into the real-time audio requirements provided the buffer size is selected carefully. The baseline overhead is shown to be roughly 0.1ms, depending on the GPU. This means buffer sizes 8 and above are completed within the allocated time frame. Results from more demanding tests, involving physical modelling synthesis, demonstrated a balance was needed between meeting the sample rate and keeping within limits for latency and jitter. Buffer sizes from 1 to 16 failed to sustain the sample rate whilst buffer sizes 512 to 32768 exceeded either latency or jitter limits. Buffer sizes in between these ranges, such as 256, satisfied the sample rate, latency and jitter requirements chosen for this paper.}

This paper describes the basic principles of Real World Audio (RWA), an extendable audio game engine for targeting smartphone operating systems, which rolls out all functionality for the generation of the above-mentioned software genres. It combines the ability for building location-based audio walks and -guides with the components necessary for game development.

We deliberately use low-tech and DIY approaches to build simple sound modules for music interaction and education in order to ensure accessibility of the technology. The modules are operated by wireless power transfer (WPT). A multichannel sound field can be easily generated and modulated by placing several sound objects in proximity to the induction coils. Alterations in sound are caused by repositioning, moving or grouping the sound modules. Although not physically linked to each other, the objects start interacting electro-acoustically when they share the same magnetic field. Because they are equipped with electronic sound generators and transducers, the sound modules can work independently from a sound studio situation.}

In particular, the size and position of the interface components of Immersive Virtual Musical Instruments (IVMIs) can be freely chosen to elicit large or small hand gestures. In addition, VR allows for the manipulation of what users visually perceive of their actual physical actions, through redirections and changes in Control-Display Ratio (CDR). Visual and gestural amplitudes can therefore be defined separately, potentially affecting the user experience in new ways. In this paper, we investigate the use of CDR to enrich the design with a control over the user perceived fatigue, sense of presence and musical expression. Our findings suggest that the CDR has an impact on the sense of presence, on the perceived difficulty of controlling the sound and on the distance covered by the hand. From these results, we derive a set of insights and guidelines for the design of IVMIs.}

Configurations defining how applications use devices can be changed on the fly without recompiling or relaunching applications. Multiple applications can be connected to the Device Server concurrently. The Device Server provides several conveniences for performance environments. It can process control data efficiently using Just-In-Time compiled Lua expressions; in doing so it frees processing cycles on audio and video rendering computers. All control signals entering the Device Server can be recorded, saved, and played back allowing performances based on control data to be recreated in their entirety. The Device Server attempts to homogenize the appearance of different control signals to applications so that users can assign any interface element they choose to application functionalities and easily experiment with different control configurations.},

Instead of being able to experiment freely with physical interfaces' affordances, performers must spend time and attention on non-musical tasks including network configuration, development environments for the mobile devices, defining OSC address spaces, and handling the receipt of OSC in the environment that will control and produce sound. Our research seeks to overcome such obstacles by minimizing the code needed to both generate and read the output of interfaces on mobile devices. For iOS and Android devices, our implementation extends the application Control to use a simple set of OSC messages to define interfaces and automatically route output. On the desktop, our implementations in Max/MSP/Jitter, LuaAV, and Su-perCollider allow users to create mobile widgets mapped to sonic parameters with a single line of code. We believe the fluidity of our approach will encourage users to incorporate mobile devices into their everyday performance practice.},

These activities impart positive skills through multi-media content delivery for all learning types. The program is designed to test practices for engaging at-risk young people from urban areas in the construction and performance of new electronic instruments. The goal is to open up the world of electronic music performance to a new generation of young digital artists and to replace negative social behaviours with creative outlets for expression through technology and performance. This paper highlights the key elements designed to deliver the program's agenda and examines the ways in which these aims were realised or tested in the classroom.}

  abstract = {The Harmonic Wand is a transducer-based instrument that combines physical excitation, synthesis, and gestural control. Our objective was to design a device that affords exploratory modes of interaction with the performer's surroundings, as well as precise control over microtonal pitch content and other concomitant parameters. The instrument is comprised of a hand-held wand, containing two piezo-electric transducers affixed to a pair of metal probes. The performer uses the wand to physically excite surfaces in the environment and capture resultant signals. Input materials are then processed using a novel application of Karplus-Strong synthesis, in which these impulses are imbued with discrete resonances. We achieved gestural control over synthesis parameters using a secondary tactile interface, consisting of four force-sensitive resistors (FSR), a fader, and momentary switch. As a unique feature of our instrument, we modeled pitch organization and associated parametric controls according to theoretical principles outlined in Harry Partch's ``monophonic fabric'' of Just Intonation---specifically his conception of odentities, udentities, and a variable numerary nexus. This system classifies pitch content based upon intervallic structures found in both the overtone and undertone series. Our paper details the procedural challenges in designing the Harmonic Wand.},

We describe these and additional extensions that came about after shared reflection on our experiences. While our chosen design contains computational inefficiencies that pose challenges for larger ensembles, our experiences suggest that this is a reasonable tradeoff for the low barrier-to-entry that browser-based environments provide, and that the design in general supports a variety of educational goals and compositional strategies.}

Audio data is represented as a collection of waveform elements, which provide a low-resolution visualisation of the audio sample. Each element, however, can be individually examined, re-positioned, or broken down into smaller fragments, thereby becoming a tangible representation of a moment in the sample. Debris is built around the idea of looking at a sound not as a linear event to be played from beginning to end, but as a non-linear collection of moments, timbres, and sound fragments which can be explored, closely examined and interacted with. This paper positions the work among conceptually related NIME interfaces, details the various user interactions and their mappings and ends with a discussion around the interface's constraints.}

  abstract = {To the naked ear, the installation Being With The Waves appears silent, but a hidden composition of voices, instrumental tones, and maritime sounds is revealed through wearing modified headphones. The installation consists of an array of tweeters emitting a multi-channel ultrasonic composition that sounds physically in the space. Ultrasonic phenomena present at the listener's ears are captured by microphones embedded on the outside of headphone earcups, shifted into audibility, and output to the headphones. The amplitude demodulation of ultrasonic material results in exaggerated Doppler effects and listeners hear the music bend and shift precisely with their movement. There are no movement sensors, mappings, or feedback loops, yet the installation is perceived as interactive due to the close entanglement of the listener with sound phenomena. The dynamic quality of interaction emerges solely through the listening faculties of the visitor, as an embodied sensory experience determined by their orientation to sounds, physical movement, and perceptual behaviour. This paper describes key influences on the installation, its ultrasonic technology, the design of modified headphones, and the compositional approach.}

Taking a research through practice approach, we examine the process of creating 'Sonographies' while deliberately allowing the nonhuman influences of site and technology to inform creative ideation and decision-making. We propose that an attunement to entanglement foregrounds the co-production of aesthetic qualities by the entire musical assemblage and fosters a sensitivity to fragile and changeable qualities of NIMEs, contingent on specific technical, material and social situations.}

This work aims the elaboration of a strategy in which several gestures performed in a joystick control can influence one or several parameters of the sound synthesis, making a mapping denominated many to many. Buttons combinations used to perform game actions that are common in fighting games, like Street Fighter, were mapped to the synthesizer to create a music. Experiments show that this mapping is capable of influencing the musical expression of a DMI making it closer to an acoustic instrument.}

The integration of the three modalities offers completely innovative capacities for interaction. The objectives are scientific, cultural and educational. Finally, an additional objective was to test such a prototype system, including its haptic arm, in real conditions for general public and over a long duration in order to measure its solidity, its reliability and its interest for users. Thus, during the last three months of the project, a demonstrator was presented and evaluated in a museum in Paris, in the form of an interactive installation offering the public a musical game.

  abstract = {Understanding the question of what makes a good musical instrument raises several conceptual challenges. Researchers have regularly adopted tools from traditional HCI as a framework to address this issue, in which instrumental musical activities are taken to comprise a device and a user, and should be evaluated as such. We argue that this approach is not equipped to fully address the conceptual issues raised by this question. It is worth reflecting on what exactly an instrument is, and how instruments contribute toward meaningful musical experiences. Based on a theoretical framework that incorporates ideas from ecological psychology, enactivism, and phenomenology, we propose an alternative approach to studying musical instruments. According to this approach, instruments are better understood in terms of processes rather than as devices, while musicians are not users, but rather agents in musical ecologies. A consequence of this reframing is that any evaluations of instruments, if warranted, should align with the specificities of the relevant processes and ecologies concerned. We present an outline of this argument and conclude with a description of a current research project to illustrate how our approach can shape the design and performance of a musical instrument in-progress.}

However, most systems rely on a small predefined set of descriptors, which the user is often required to understand and choose from. There is no guarantee that the chosen descriptors are relevant for a given collection. In addition, this method does not scale to longer samples that require higher-dimensional descriptions, which biases systems towards the use of short samples. In this paper we propose novel framework for automatic creation of interactive sound spaces from sound collections using feature learning and dimensionality reduction. The framework is implemented as a software library using the SuperCollider language. We compare several algorithms and describe some example interfaces for interacting with the resulting spaces. Our experiments signal the potential of unsupervised algorithms for creating data-driven musical interfaces.}

  abstract = {In the realm of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs), tactile feedback typically inherent in acoustic instruments is notably absent, creating a gap in the sensory experience of musicians. Previous works typically aimed at bridging this gap by designing haptic effects using trial-and-error strategies. This paper introduces Sonic Touch, a toolkit developed in Max/MSP that facilitates the rapid prototyping of audio-driven vibrotactile haptic effects. The toolkit allows users to design a variety of haptic effects by manipulating parameters like wave type, vibration duration, frequency, repetition, and envelope, then store and manage them in buffers for output. The toolkit's architecture is grounded in a modular, building-block approach, accessible through a simple graphical user interface. Practical use of this toolkit is demonstrated through two examples, first designing a haptic tremolo effect, and second augmenting a Touch\'e controller with vibrotactile feedback.}

  abstract = {CALM is a performance piece from a collection of works that explore trauma through trauma-informed therapeutic models, such as bi-lateral coordination drawing, yoga, and tapping, and existing movement practices, such as yoga, Pilates, dance, and conducting, to control and manipulate sound in performance. This work draws from yoga practice to control the volumes and audio effects on pre-composed audio layers through use of datagloves (MiMu with their proprietary software Glover (MI.MU Gloves Ltd, 2010), though this is not specific to the constraints of the MiMu/Glover system) and Max/MSP (Cycling '74, 2018). Yoga is a movement practice often recommended to manage symptoms of trauma and anxiety due to the focus on one's body and generally meditative nature or the practice. However, in cases of sexual trauma, yoga may yield the opposite of the desired results when not used in a trauma-sensitive context (Khoudari, 2021; Levine et al., 2010). This is because the individual tries to focus on the body in which they do not feel safe and encounter unresolved trauma. Thus, instead of a grounding effect, the individual hears the mental and physical pain that they have endured repeating itself in the present. To reflect this, ``stillness'' audio material is routed to scream-like and abrasive sounds, while ``movement'' audio quiets the listener's internal landscape. Movements used in the live piece were chosen based on providing extramusical benefit to the composer-performer (and areas that are typically carrying tension as a result of the trauma) without contributing to any negative effects, for example, the pose ``Happy Baby/Ananda Balasana'' was excluded and Malasana (a deep squat pose) was used in its place as it puts the performer in a less vulnerable position by being on one's feet.}

We use a practiced-based methodology informed by our skillset as percussionists to study how instrumental skills and sensibilities can be incorporated into the personalization of, and performance with, DMIs. We introduced a simple and adaptable digital musical instrument, built using the Arduino Uno, that individuals (percussionists) could personalize and extend in order to improvise, compose and create music (\'etudes). Our analysis maps parallel percussion practices emerging from the resultant DMI compositions and performances by examining the functionality of each Arduino instrument through the lens of material-oriented and communication-oriented approaches to interactivity.}

We conduct a corpus assisted discourse analysis of "timbre" in all NIME proceedings to date (2001-2024). Combining this with a detailed review of 18 timbre-focused papers at NIME, we examine how definitions of timbre and timbre interaction methods are constructed through, for instance, Wessel's numerical timbre control space, synthesis tools and programming languages, machine learning and AI approaches, and other trends in digital lutherie practices. While acknowledging the practical utility of technical constructions of timbre in NIME (and other digital music research communities), we contribute discussion on the entanglement of technology and aesthetics in instrument design, which constitutes what "timbre" becomes in NIME research and reflect on the tension between technoscientific and constructivist understandings of timbre: how DMIs and musical practices have been reconstituted around particular timbral values operationalised in NIME. In response, we propose ways that the NIME community can embrace more critical approaches and awareness to how our methods and tools shape and co-create our notions of timbre, as well as other musical concepts, connecting more openly with diverse types of sonic phenomena.}

At its core, it samples an input audio signal and allows the performer to replay these samples through a granular resynthesizer. Normally the Fragment String samples an acoustic instrument that accompanies it, but in the absence of this input it will amplify the ambient environment and electronic noise of the input audio path to audible levels and sample these. This ability to leverage both structural, tonal sound and unstructured noise provide the instrument with multiple dimensions of musical expressivity. The relative magnitude of the physical gestures required to manipulate the instrument and control the sound also engage an audience in its performance. This straightforward yet expressive design has lent the Fragment String to a variety of performance techniques and settings.

  abstract = {In recent decades, with the innovation in sensor technology, the trend towards smaller digital controllers for instruments has expanded. New generations of performance styles are growing that rely on compact instruments that can travel easily and are thus versatile. This article cites two interactive performance practices to illustrate how larger instruments change the nature of interaction and sonic outcomes of performance. Pressure-sensitive Floors, a wooden set of platforms for performing electronic music, are compared with a practice on the Renaissance violone with electronics. Large instruments offer unique additions to performance and music making that are not accessible in small instruments. They have their own specific affordances and limitations that affect the musical decisions of the performer and therefore contribute unique ways of conceptualising performance. The instruments in this paper have been chosen as the authors have a 'sustained relationship' with them and these practices merely act as examples of the embodied knowledge gained through staying committed to a particular large instrument. We demonstrate how with such a practice, the performance is recentered around human presence. This offers a deeper communication between performer and audience. It creates new avenues for the performance of contemporary music where the entire body is engaged in movement and sounding. We argue that overlooking large instruments in favour of their smaller counterparts would result in the loss of a unique aesthetic as well as conceptual and performance approaches.}

A fingerboard traversal system with a dynamic finger tip apparatus enables the robot to play gamakas - pitch based embellishments in-between notes, which are at the core of Carnatic music. A double roller design is used for bowing which reduces space, produces a tone that resembles the tone of a conventional violin bow, and facilitates super human playing techniques such as infinite bowing. The design also enables the user to change the bow hair tightness to help capture a variety of performing techniques in different musical styles. Objective assessments and subjective listening tests were conducted to evaluate our design, indicating that the robot can play gamakas in a realistic manner and thus, can perform Carnatic music.}

Unlike other professional applications used for mashups, Mixboard does not require experience with Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) or waveform editing and supports unlimited library of usable songs. In a co-creative fashion, users can explore their creativity while the system contributes its own creative input utilizing Music Information Retrieval (MIR), Digital Signal Processing (DSP), and compositional templates. User studies were conducted to evaluate Mixboard's success in achieving an effective balance between system automation and user control. Results indicate strong metrics for user creative expression, engagement, and ownership, as well as high satisfaction with the final musical outcome. Results also suggest a number of modifications to the balance between user control and system automation, which will be addressed in future work.}

The possibility to use sensors for providing an input for sound processing/synthesis units let composers and sound artist open up new ways for experimentation. Augmented Reality, by rendering virtual objects in the real world and by making those objects interactive (via some sensor-generated input), provides a new frame for this research field. In fact, the 3D visual feedback, delivering a precise indication of the spatial configuration/function of each virtual interface, can make the instrumental augmentation process more intuitive for the interpreter and more resourceful for a composer/creator: interfaces can change their behavior over time, can be reshaped, activated or deactivated. Each of these modifications can be made obvious to the performer by using strategies of visual feedback. In addition, it is possible to accurately sample space and to map it with differentiated functions. Augmenting interfaces can also be considered a visual expressive tool for the audience and designed accordingly: the performer's point of view (or another point of view provided by an external camera) can be mirrored to a projector. This article will show some example of different designs of AR piano augmentation from the composition Studi sulla realt\`a nuova.}

This is usually approached by using a reference system, such as an optical motion capture system, to assess the signals' properties. However, this process raises the issue of synchronizing the signal and the reference data streams, as each sensor is subject to different latency, time drift, reference clocks and initialization timings. This paper presents an empirical quantification of the latency communication stages in a setup consisting of a Qualisys optical motion capture (mocap) system and a wireless microcontroller-based sensor device. We performed event-to-end tests on the critical components of the hybrid setup to determine the synchronization suitability. Overall, further synchronization is viable because of the near individual average latencies of around 25ms for both the mocap system and the wireless sensor interface.}

Also, players make physical motions and, in many cases, these gestures are related to the musicians' artistic intentions. However, it's not clear if the sound manipulation reflects in physical motions. The understanding of the musical structure of the work being performed in its many levels may impact the projection of artistic intentions, and performers alter it in micro and macro-sections, such as in musical motifs, phrases and sessions. Therefore, this paper investigates the timing manipulation and how such variations may reflect in physical gestures. The study involved musicians (flute, clarinet, and bassoon players) performing a unison excerpt by G. Rossini. We analyzed the relationship between timing variation (the Inter Onsets Interval deviations) and physical motion based on the traveled distance of the flute under different conditions. The flutists were asked to play the musical excerpt in three experimental conditions: (1) playing solo and playing in duets with previous recordings by other instrumentalists, (2) clarinetist and (3) bassoonist. The finding suggests that: 1) the movements, which seem to be related to the sense of pulse, are recurrent and stable, 2) the timing variability in micro or macro sections reflects in gestures' amplitude performed by flutists.}

Our approach targets taps produced on a variety of surfaces without other controlled timbral characteristics other than playing style. Our long-term goal is to enable more accessible and creative percussive exploration, but presents significant challenges due to the minimal timbre variation between taps intended to represent different drum classes. To address these challenges, we take the first steps toward achieving ADTS by designing an effective dataset synthesis strategy. This strategy enables new opportuneties for musical expression by considering drumming at a more semantic or functional level as opposed to a simple collection of timbres. We present initial results, comparing three different models: one trained on drum data, another trained on a small dataset of quasi-aligned tapped performances, and another trained on our synthetic dataset. Our synthetic approach shows promise, demonstrating progress in this untapped domain.}

Other works have studied conductors' gestures in relation to the performance of the orchestra. The goal of this study is to analyze, following the path initiated by this latter kind of works, how simple motion capture descriptors can explain the relationship between the loudness of a given performance and the way in which different subjects move when asked to impersonate the conductor of that performance. Twenty-five subjects were asked to impersonate the conductor of three classical music fragments while listening to them. The results of different linear regression models with motion capture descriptors as explanatory variables show that, by studying how descriptors correlate to loudness differently among subjects, different tendencies can be found and exploited to design models that better adjust to their expectations.}

Instead, it is completely controlled via hand gestures using a glove that is populated with motion-tracking markers. The main purpose of this system is to offer intuitive physical interaction with the perimeter-based spatial sound sources. Further, its goal is to minimize user-worn technology and thereby enhance freedom of motion by utilizing environmental sensing devices, such as motion capture cameras or infrared sensors. The ensuing creativity enabling technology is applicable to a broad array of possible scenarios, from researching limits of human spatial hearing perception to facilitating learning and artistic performances, including dance. In this paper, we describe our NIME design and implementation, its preliminary assessment, and offer a Unity-based toolkit to facilitate its broader deployment and adoption.}

When compared with their physical counterparts, current control paradigms employed in touch screen musical interfaces do not require the same level of physical labor and this negatively affects the user experience in terms of expressivity, engagement and enjoyment. This lack of physicality can be remedied by using interaction elements, which are designed for the exertion of the user. Employing intentionally difficult and inefficient interaction design can enhance the user experience by allowing greater bodily expression, kinesthetic feedback, more apparent skill acquisition, and performer satisfaction. Rub Synth is a touch screen musical instrument with an exertion interface. It was made for creating and testing exertion strategies that are possible by only using 2d touch coordinates as input and evaluating the outcomes of implementing intentional difficulty. This paper discusses the strategies that can be employed to model effort on touch screens, the benefits of having physical difficulty, Rub Synth's interaction design, and user experience results of using such an interface.}

Symbols representing these musical structures are sent over the network toa corresponding computer system. The computer at thereceiving end anticipates incoming events by analyzing previous phrases and synthesizes an estimated audio output.Although such a system may introduce variants due to prediction approximations, resulting in a slightly different musical experience at both ends, we find that it demonstratesa high level of playability with an immediacy not present inother systems, and functions well as an educational tool.},

This allows the DJ to focus on the crowd, thus providing the DJ a better intuition of what kind of music ormusical mixing style the audience is more likely to enjoyand engage with. Additionally, Mmmmm has an Ambient Tempo Detection mode in which the phones camera is utilized to detect the amount of movement in the environment and suggest to the DJ the tempo of music that should be played. This mode utilizes frame differencing and pixelchange overtime to get a sense of how fast the environmentis changing, loosely correlating to how fast the audience isdancing or the lights are flashing in the scene. By determining the ambient tempo of the environment the DJ canget a better sense for the type of music that would fit bestfor their venue.Mmmmm helps novice DJs achieve a better music repertoire by allowing them to interact with their audience andreceive direct feedback on their performance.

Reflections on the project underscored its narrative and interactive strengths, while also identifying music and visual elements that could be further refined to augment the immersive quality of the experience.}

  abstract = {Harriet Padberg wrote Computer-Composed Canon and Free Fugue as part of her 1964 dissertation in Mathematics and Music at Saint Louis University. This program is one of the earliest examples of text-to-music software and algorithmic composition, which are areas of great interest in the present-day field of music technology. This paper aims to analyze the technological innovation, aesthetic design process, and impact of Harriet Padberg's original 1964 thesis as well as the design of a modern recreation and utilization, in order to gain insight to the nature of revisiting older works. Here, we present our open source recreation of Padberg's program with a modern interface and, through its use as an artistic tool by three composers, show how historical works can be effectively used for new creative purposes in contemporary contexts. Not Even One by Molly Jones draws on the historical and social significance of Harriet Padberg through using her program in a piece about the lack of representation of women judges in composition competitions. Brevity by Anna Savery utilizes the original software design as a composition tool, and The Padberg Piano by Anthony Caulkins uses the melodic generation of the original to create a software instrument.}

In a context of music control, this assumptionimplies that a relatively low digital sample rate (100-200Hz) is sufficient to capture and/or reproduce this signal.We tested this assumption by evaluating the frequency content in breath pressure, particularly during the use of extended performance techniques such as growling, humming,and flutter tonguing. Our results indicate frequency contentin a breath pressure signal up to about 10 kHz, with especially significant energy within the first 1000 Hz. We furtherinvestigated the frequency response of several commerciallyavailable pressure sensors to assess their responsiveness tohigher frequency breath signals. Though results were mixed,some devices were found capable of sensing frequencies upto at least 1.5 kHz. Finally, similar measurements were conducted with Yamaha WX11 and WX5 wind controllers andresults suggest that their breath pressure outputs are sampled at about 320 Hz and 280 Hz, respectively.},

The work we present here was commissioned by a festival and ran on a daily basis over a period of three months. A GPS-enabled embedded Linux system is assembled to serve as a location-aware sound platform. Several challenges have to be overcome both technically and artistically to achieve a seamless experience and provide a simple device to be handed to the public. By building this interactive experience, which relies as much on the user's willingness to explore the invisible sonic landscape as on the ability to deploy the technology, a number of new avenues for exploring electronic music and interactivity in location-based media open up. New ways of composing music for and in a landscape and for creating audience interaction are explored.},

The mapping of gestures to source motion is implemented by giving the sources physical object properties and manipulating these characteristics with standard geometrical transforms through hierarchical or emergent relationships.},

The performed calls from online visitors evolve using AI as they pass through the frog collective. After performing a rhythm, audiences listen ambisonically from behind a virtual veil and attempt to map the formation of the frogs, based on the spatial information embedded in their calls. After listening, audience members can reveal the frogs and their formation.

The MIDI data is used to control external vocal effects units such as live loopers, reverbs, distortion pedals, etc. The goal was to to provide dramatically increased expressive control to vocal performances, and address some of the shortcomings of pedal-controlled effects. The addition of gestural controls from the motion sensors opens up new performance possibilities such as panning the voice simply by pointing the microphone in one direction or another. The result is a hybrid microphone-musical instrument which has recieved extremely positive results from vocalists in numerous infor-mal workshops.},

In this paper, the titles of NIME conference proceedings from 2001 to 2013 were searched for presentations on ILAA using positioning technology. Over 80 relevant articles were found. For each of the systems we evaluated if and why APS would be a contender or not.

We define a series of application scenarios where we describe in detail what functionality is required to inform an implementation.

We use convolution to excite the grains from the corpus via the microphone input, capturing the contact interaction sounds, which allows articulation of the corpus by hitting, scratching, or strumming a surface with various parts of the hands or objects. We also show how changes of grains have to be carefully handled, how one can smoothly interpolate between neighbouring grains, and finally evaluate the system against previous attempts.}

  abstract = {Machine learning tools for designing motion-sound relationships often rely on a two-phase iterative process, where users must alternate between designing gestures and performing mappings. We present a first prototype of a user adaptable tool that aims at merging these design and performance steps into one fully interactive experience. It is based on an online learning implementation of a Gaussian Mixture Model supporting real-time adaptation to user movement and generation of sound parameters. To allow both fine-tune modification tasks and open-ended improvisational practices, we designed two interaction modes that either let users shape, or guide interactive motion-sound mappings. Considering an improvisational use case, we propose two example musical applications to illustrate how our tool might support various forms of corporeal engagement with sound, and inspire further perspectives for machine learning-mediated embodied musical expression.}

We report on the diffractive prototyping and iterative crafting of three such soundwalks through/out deep latent spaces, using nn and New Atlantis as computational platforms for AI audio processing and virtual world experimentation. We share critical perspectives emerging from our latent soundwalking practice, with the hope that they contribute to ongoing community-wide reflections toward new AI for musical expression.}

In this paper, we introduce our Sounding Brush project, through which we explore music making in various forms with the natural gestures of drawing and mark making on a tablet device. Subsequently, we present the design and development of the Sounding Brush application. Utilising this project idea, we discuss the act of drawing as an activity that is not separated from the act of playing musical instrument. Drawing is essentially the act of playing music by means of a continuous process of observation, individualisation and exploring time and space in a unique way.}

But there is a twist. Unlike "I Am Sitting in a Room," which unfolds as a gradual process with no further interaction once the process has begun, I Am Sitting in a (Latent) Room gives the improvisers the ability to intervene and interact with the process of degradation in real time. An audio clip is repeatedly encoded and decoded through two parallel instances of a bespoke variational autoencoder (VAE) model. On top of this process, the performers manipulates the model's latent embeddings in real-time, exploring the latent space (or "room") of the model over the course of the performance. Two performances with the composer and live-coding duo RGGTRN are presented. This work explores human-in-the-loop AI systems through group improvisation, interactive AI performance, and creating datasets as a part of the compositional process.}

The time for package management, as the ChucK slogan goes, is now. What began as a practical project has expanded into broader reflections on tool-building, service, and community. As we labored on what seemed like a ``no-brainer'' tool that everyone wanted but that no one wanted to build, questions arose: ``how did we get here?'', ``what is the role of service-based tool-building in our field--and what, if any, is its research value?''---in short, ``can we even write a paper about a package manager?'' Meanwhile, we couldn't help but notice that the act of creating a package manager seems to unify not only disparate software fragments, but also something of community. In other words, there may be more than meets the eye. This paper chronicles the making of a package manager and all that goes along with it. This is the story of ChuMP.}

Thisincludes slow attacks and infinite sustain while preservingthe familiar spectral qualities of this classic electromechanical piano. These additional parameters are controlled withaftertouch on the existing keyboard, extending standardpiano technique. Two sustain methods were investigated,driving the actuator first with a pure sine wave, and secondwith the output signal of the sensor. A special isolationmethod effectively decouples the sensors from the actuatorsand tames unruly feedback in the high-gain signal path.},

Although there are many opportunities to shape the amplitude envelope before loudspeaker amplification, they are all governed by the ever-decaying physical vibra-tions of the tone generating mechanism. A single-note proof of concept for electromagnetic control over this vibrating mechanism was presented at NIME 2011. In the past year, virtually every aspect of the system has been improved. We use a different vibration sensor that is immune to electromagnetic interference, thus eliminat-ing troublesome feedback. For control, we both reduce cost and gain continuous position sensing throughout the entire range of key motion in addition to aftertouch pressure. Finally, the entire system now fits within the space constraints presented by the original piano, allowing it to be installed on adjacent notes.},

This process is complicated by the ill-defined nature of timbre and the complex relationship between synthesizer parameters and their sonic output. In this work, we focus on real-time timbre remapping with percussion instruments, combining technical development with practice-based methods to address these challenges. As a technical contribution, we introduce a genetic algorithm - applicable to black-box synthesizers including VSTs and modular synthesizers - to generate datasets of synthesizer presets that vary according to target timbres. Additionally, we propose a neural network-based approach to predict control features from short onset windows, enabling low-latency performance and feature-based control. Our technical development is grounded in musical practice, demonstrating how iterative and collaborative processes can yield insights into open-ended challenges in DMI design. Experiments on various audio representations uncover meaningful insights into timbre remapping by coupling data-driven design with practice-based reflection. This work is accompanied by an annotated portfolio, presenting a series of musical performances and experiments with reflections.}

  abstract = {Timbre is a primary mode of expression in diverse musical contexts. However, prevalent audio-driven synthesis methods predominantly rely on pitch and loudness envelopes, effectively flattening timbral expression from the input. Our approach draws on the concept of timbre analogies and investigates how timbral expression from an input signal can be mapped onto controls for a synthesizer. Leveraging differentiable digital signal processing, our method facilitates direct optimization of synthesizer parameters through a novel feature difference loss. This loss function, designed to learn relative timbral differences between musical events, prioritizes the subtleties of graded timbre modulations within phrases, allowing for meaningful translations in a timbre space. Using snare drum performances as a case study, where timbral expression is central, we demonstrate real-time timbre remapping from acoustic snare drums to a differentiable synthesizer modeled after the Roland TR-808.}

This study investigates the usability of the ARCube, an AR-based spatial audio controller, with twelve distinct musical instruments played by experienced musicians. We identify usability challenges specific to certain instruments, particularly for two-handed playing, as well as issues related to gesture recognition and cube stability. Our analysis shows that interaction patterns, such as cube placement, sound effect usage, and gesture strategies, vary significantly between instruments. These differences are driven by the physical form of the instruments, the required playing techniques, and user expectations for control and responsiveness. Based on these insights, we suggest directions for developing adaptable AR interfaces that better accommodate diverse instruments and support broader integration of AR technologies into musical practice.}

In addition, optical and hall-effect sensors detect the passing of aspoke-mounted photodiode and two magnets.

The system is currently implementedand assessed as a potential means to reduce motion-induceddistortion in CT images.A museum installation based on the same principle wascreated in which an inexpensive wall-mounted web camera tracks an IR sensor embedded into a pendant worn bythe user. The motion of the subjects breathing is trackedand interpreted as a real-time variable tempo adjustment toa stored musical file. The subject can then adjust his/herbreathing to synchronize with a separate accompanimentline. When the breathing is regular and is at the desiredtempo, the audible result sounds synchronous and harmonious. The accompaniment's tempo progresses and gradually decrease which causes the breathing to synchronize andslow down, thus increasing relaxation.},

These interfaces are made out of plastic, metal, glass and rubber, built with sensors that seek precision and ergonomic control. However, there are other more unconventional interfaces, such as flexible and soft instruments that allow for different types of interaction. One of the materials that has not been explored extensively in this context, are textiles, in particular e-textiles. Here, we survey the NIME archive and provide an overview of the work on non-rigid interfaces. Further, this paper presents a new textile based musical interface and evaluates its potential as a malleable, expressive instrument through a case study with 6 musicians. The findings of the qualitative analysis conclude a set of guidelines for the development of future e-textile interfaces.}

The triple pendulum is a simple physical system constructed by attaching three pendulums vertically such that each joint can swing freely. When subjected to large oscillations, its motion is chaotic and is often described as unexpectedly mesmerizing. Le B\^aton uses wireless inertial measurement units (IMUs) embedded in each pendulum arm to send real-time motion data to Max/MSP. Additionally, we implemented a control mechanism, allowing a user to remotely interact with it by setting the initial release angle. Here, we explain the motivation and design of Le B\^aton and describe mapping strategies. To conclude, we discuss how its nature of user interaction complicates its status as a digital musical instrument.}

Our target application is so-called motion controllers,i.e. systems that interpret hand motion for musical interaction. In earlierresearch we found effective methods to design nearly optimal filters forreal-time applications. However, to be able to design suitable filters for ourtarget application, it is necessary to establish the typical frequency contentof the motion capture data we want to filter. This will again allow us todetermine a reasonable cutoff frequency for the filters. We have thereforeconducted an experiment in which we recorded the hand motion of 20 subjects.The frequency spectra of these data together with a method similar to theresidual analysis method were then used to determine reasonable cutofffrequencies. Based on this experiment, we propose three cutoff frequencies fordifferent scenarios and filtering needs: 5, 10 and 15 Hz, which corresponds toheavy, medium and light filtering respectively. Finally, we propose a range ofreal-time filters applicable to motion controllers. In particular, low-passfilters and low-pass differentiators of degrees one and two, which in ourexperience are the most useful filters for our target application.}

We present GestAlt, an AI-based interactive music system that collaborates with a performer by analyzing their gestures and motion to generate audio changes. It uses computer vision, online machine learning, and reinforcement learning to adapt to a user's hand motion patterns and allow a user to communicate their musical goals to the system. It communicates its decision-making to the user through visualizations and its musical output. We conducted a study in which five musicians performed using this software over multiple sessions. Participants discussed how their preferences for the system's behavior were influenced by their experiences as musicians, how adaptive reinforcement learning affected their expectations for the system's autonomy, and how their perceptions of the system as a creatively autonomous, collaborative partner evolved as they learned how to perform with the system.}

However, how the timbral properties of an instrument affect learning has received little systematic empirical research. In an exploratory study, we assessed whether timbral feedback from a physical model based percussive DMI influences beginner players' performance in a musical learning task. We contrasted the timbral richness of a metallic plate physical model with an amplitude modulated pink-noise signal that was comparable in response to input controls but with relatively reduced timbral features. Two groups of participants practiced three sets of simple beats using their respective version of the instrument (physical model or pink noise), over the course of an hour. Their performance was recorded throughout and assessed in the form of rhythmic timing accuracy. Results showed that participants' performance in both sound groups significantly improved throughout the task. Timing accuracy was significantly better in the physical model group for one out of three sets of beats. We argue that the timbral feedback of a musical instrument may influence beginner's playing experience, encouraging further research into how this could benefit DMI design.}

  abstract = {The Electrosteel is a new electronic instrument inspired by the user interface of the pedal steel guitar (PSG). The Electrosteel uses the interface concepts of the PSG (a bar in the left hand, plucked strings for the right hand, foot pedals, knee levers, etc) as a control paradigm for digital synthesis. The instrument allows performers with skill on the PSG to expand their sonic range, and creates a powerful new multi-dimensional way to control synthesis. This paper describes the development of the instrument and its custom embedded synthesis engine, with a focus on the design challenges posed by mapping an existing performer interface to a new instrument.}

  abstract = {Thermal Music is a project to explore the possibilities of coordinating control of temperature sensation with control of sound and light. Unlike convective heating technologies that change the temperature of the air around us, radiative heating works by directly heating the surface of our skin via infrared. The technology is widely used in portable heaters in outdoor dining areas of restaurants. One interesting advantage of radiative heating is that if the source of infrared radiation is shaded by a thermally reflective surface, the change in perceived temperature by a person near the heater is very rapid. We worked to create a system that could quickly control robotic shades in front of a radiative heater to synchronize changes in perceived temperature with music and light. We also explored the inverse, using thermal camera input as a control method for audio, and presented both of these techniques at a "Thermal Music" concert at Princeton University in October of 2023.}

Suggestions on how deaf and hearing people can collaborate in creating music together, are presented. The conducted research will focus on deaf people with a general interest in music as well as hearing musicians as target groups. Through reviewing different related research areas, it is found that visualization of sound along with a haptic feedback can help deaf people interpret and interact with music. With this in mind, three variations of a collaborative user interface are presented, in which deaf and hearing people are meant to collaborate in creating short beats and melody sequences. Through evaluating the three prototypes, with two deaf people and two hearing musicians, it is found that the target groups can collaborate to some extent in creating beats. However, in order for the target groups to create melodic sequences together in a satisfactory manner, more detailed visualization and distributed haptic output is necessary, mostly due to the fact that the deaf test participants struggle in distinguishing between higher pitch and timbre.},

As a result of our research efforts, the Waseda Flutist Robot WF-4RIV and the Waseda Saxophonist Robot WAS-1 have been designed to reproduce the human player performance. As a long-term goal, we are proposing to enable the interaction between musical performance robots as well as with human players. In general the communication of humans within a band is a special case of conventional human social behavior. Rhythm, harmony and timbre of the music played represent the emotional states of the musicians. So the development of an artificial entity that participates in such an interaction may contribute to the better understanding of some of the mechanisms that enable the communication of humans in musical terms. Therefore, we are not considering a musical performance robot (MPR) just as a mere sophisticated MIDI instrument. Instead, its human-like design and the integration of perceptual capabilities may enable to act on its own autonomous initiative based on models which consider its own physical constrains. In this paper, we present an overview of our research approaches towards enabling the interaction between musical performance robots as well as with musicians.},

In addition, a human-like hand (16 DOF-s) has been designed to enable to play all the keys of the instrument. Regarding the improvement of the control system, a feed-forward control system with dead-time compensation has been implemented to assure the accurate control of the air pressure. In addition, the implementation of an auditory feedback control system has been proposed and implemented in order to adjust the positioning of the physical parameters of the components of the robot by providing a pitch feedback and defining a recovery position (off-line). A set of experiments were carried out to verify the mechanical design improvements and the dynamic response of the air pressure. As a result, the range of sound pressure has been increased and the proposed control system improved the dynamic response of the air pressure control.},

A review is given of existing research into semantic descriptors of timbre, as well as corresponding acoustic features of timbre. Discussion is also given on existing interface design techniques. The perceptually motivated approach to interface design is demonstrated using an example system, which makes use of perceptually relevant mappings from acoustic timbre features to semantic timbre descriptors and visualises sounds as physical objects.},

Although weused the logistic equation as orbit generator, any dynami-cal system could be suitable. The main idea lies on generating vectors of Rn with entriesfrom data series of di\_x000B\_erent orbits from an speci\_x000C\_c dynami-cal system. Such vectors will be called system vectors. Ourproposal is to create ordered paths between those pointsor system vectors using the Splines Quark library by Felix,1which allow us to generate smooth curves joining the points.Finally, interpolating that result with a \_x000C\_xed sample value,we are able to obtain speci\_x000C\_c and independent multidimen-sional panning trajectories for each speaker array and forany number of sound sources.Our contribution is intended to be at the very root of the compositionalprocess giving to the creator a method for exploring new ways for spatialsound placement over time for a wide range of speakers ar-rangements. The advantage of using controlled chaotic dy-namical systems like the logistic equation, lies on the factthat the composer can freely and consciously choose be-tween stable or irregular behaviour for the orbits that willgenerate his/her panning trajectories. Besides, with the useof isometries, it is possible to generate di\_x000B\_erent related or-bits with one single evaluation of the system. The use ofthe spline method in SuperCollider allows the possibilityof joining and relating those values from orbits into a wellde\_x000C\_ned and coherent general system. Further research willinclude controlling synthesis parameters in the same waywe created panning trajectories.},

There have been many examples of such use, including sound-responsive visualisations, adaptive audio effects and machine musicianship. However, at present, using audio analysis algorithms in live performance requires either some detailed knowledge about the algorithms themselves, or programming or both. Those wishing to use audio analysis in live performances may not have either of these as their strengths. Rather, they may instead wish to focus upon systems that respond to audio analysis data, such as visual projections or sound generators. In response, this paper introduces the Sound Analyser an audio plug-in allowing users to a) select a custom set of audio analyses to be performed in real-time and b) send that information via OSC so that it can easily be used by other systems to develop responsive applications for live performances and installations. A description of the system architecture and audio analysis algorithms implemented in the plug-in is presented before moving on to two case studies where the plug-in has been used in the field with artists.}

  abstract = {Musicians, audio engineers and producers often make use of common timbral adjectives to describe musical signals and transformations. However, the subjective nature of these terms, and the variability with respect to musical context often leads to inconsistencies in their definition. In this study, a model is proposed for controlling an equaliser by navigating clusters of datapoints, which represent grouped parameter settings with the same timbral description. The interface allows users to identify the nearest cluster to their current parameter setting and recommends changes based on its relationship to a cluster centroid. To do this, we apply dimensionality reduction to a dataset of equaliser curves described as warm and bright using a stacked autoencoder, then group the entries using an agglomerative clustering algorithm with a coherence based distance criterion. To test the efficacy of the system, we implement listening tests and show that subjects are able to match datapoints to their respective sub-representations with 93.75\% mean accuracy.}

  abstract = {Extended playing techniques are a crucial characteristic of contemporary double bass practice. Players find their voice by developing a personal vocabulary of techniques through practice and experimentation. These player-idiosyncratic techniques are used in composition, performance, and improvisation. Today's AI methods offer the opportunity to recognize such techniques and repurpose them in real-time, leading to new forms of interactions between musicians and machines. This paper is the result of a collaboration between a composer/double-bass player and researchers, born from the musician's desire for an interactive improvisational experience with AI centered around the practice of his extended techniques. With this aim, we developed Esteso: an interactive improvisational system based on extended technique recognition, live electronics, and a timbre-transfer double-bass model. We evaluated our system with the musician with three duet improvisational sessions, each using different mapping strategies between the techniques and the sound of the virtual double bass counterpart. We collected qualitative data from the musician to gather insights about the three configurations and the corresponding improvisational duets, as well as investigate the resulting interactions. We provide a discussion about the outcomes of our analysis and draw more general design considerations.}

The FLAPIBox is an integrated solution that fits most acoustic instruments and use its own resonance for playing electronic sound in a more organic way---through the instrument itself. Reviewing related works and exploring different hardware and software components, a modular prototype has been built. The results of this preliminary study make the body of planning and building the first integrated breadboard prototype. Because of its flexible design, the FLAPIBox can use several different microphone, and loudspeaker technologies. Using inexpensive components and developing open-source software, the FLAPIBox is both affordable and accessible. The development of the FLAPIBox aim to result in a stable and predictable platform, yet open and versatile enough for further development.}

Notes are played by touch, but are sustained through continuous movement. Pitch bends can be achieved by passing through the space between the notes. Its current implementation runs only on Apple iPad tablet computers using a libPd to convert user interaction into audio. An iPad overlay offers physical feedback for the circles as well as the pitch bend area between the circles. A performable version of the application has been built, though several active developments allow alternative sonic interpretation of the gestures, enhanced visual response to user interaction, and the ability to control the instrument with multiple devices.}

The system features a digital game and a public web app that allows audience members to participate using their mobile devices. After connecting via QR code, participants create and pilot virtual fish that generate music as they bump into one another. The performer then enters the game as a shark, using camera-based hand tracking to chase and consume the participants' fish. The result is a performance dynamic that evolves from playful co-creation to one of gameful contest between the performer and audience. SwimTunes explores how this shifting interaction context can shape the instantiation of a set of musical parameters, and further how performers can harness gameplay metaphors to conduct live audiences in shared acts of musical expression. The paper details the design considerations and conceptual motivations that informed SwimTunes before describing its implementation via Node.js, Open Sound Control, Unreal Engine 5, and MetaSounds. It discusses technical challenges and opportunities unearthed during development and outlines future directions for the project and gamified music performance at large.}

The sonification of natural soil moisture processes tests the limits of our attention, patience and willingness to still perceive ultra-slow reactions and examines the mechanisms of our sense adaptation. Although the musical time of the installation is set to almost non-human -- environmental time scale (changes happen within hours, days, weeks or even months\dots ) this system can be explored and even played also as an instrument by putting sensors to different soil areas or pouring liquid into the soil and waiting for changes... The crucial aspect of the work was to design the sonification architecture that deals with extreme slow changes of input data -- measured values from moisture sensors. The result is the sound installation consisting of three objects -- each with different types of soil. Every object is compact, independent unit consisting of three low-cost capacitive soil moisture sensors, 1m long perspex tube filled with soil, full range loudspeaker and Bela platform with custom Supercollider code. I developed this installation during the year 2019 and this paper gives insight into the aspects and issues connected with creating this installation.}

  abstract = {For the electric guitar, which takes a large proportion in modern pop music, effects unit (or effector) is no longer optional. Many guitarists already `play' their effects with their instrument. However, it is not easy to control these effects during the play, so lots of new controllers and interfaces have been devised; one example is a pedal type effects that helps players to control effects with a foot while their hands are busy. Some players put a controller on their guitars. However, our instruments are so precious to drill a hole, and the stage is too big for the player who is just kneeling behind the pedals and turning the knobs. In this paper, we designed a new control system for electric guitar and bass. This paper is about a gesture-based sound control system that controls the electric guitar effects (like delay time, reverberation or pitch) with the player's hand gesture. This system utilizes TAPIR signal to trace player's hand motion. TAPIR signal is an acoustic signal that can rarely be received by most people, because its frequency exists between 18 kHz to 22 kHz [TAPIR article]. This system consists of a signal generator, an electric guitar and a sound processor. From the generator that is attached on the player's hand, the TAPIR signal transfers to the magnetic pickup equipped on the electric guitar. Player's gesture is captured as a Doppler shift and the processor calculates the value as the sound effect parameter. In this paper, we focused on the demonstration of the signal transfer on aforementioned system.}

This study aims at designing and evaluating a set of collaborative musical instruments for children with cognitive and physical disabilities, and the research is done together with the special education school Rullen in Stockholm, Sweden. The process was divided into three main parts; a pre-study, building and designing, and finally a user study. Based on findings from previous research, together with input received from teachers at Rullen during the pre-study, the resulting design consists of four musical instruments that are connected to a central hub. The results show that the instruments functioned as intended and that the design makes musical learning accessible in a way traditional instruments do not, as well as creates a good basis for a collaborative musical experience. However, fully evaluating the effect of playing together requires more time for the children to get comfortable with the instruments and also for the experiment leaders to test different setups to optimize the conditions for a good interplay.}

AI-terity is a deformable, non-rigid musical instrument that comprises a particular artificial intelligence (AI) method for generating audio samples for real-time audio synthesis. As an improvement, we developed the control interface structure with additional sensor hardware. In addition, we implemented a new hybrid deep learning architecture, GANSpaceSynth, in which we applied the GANSpace method on the GANSynth model. Following the deep learning model improvement, we developed new autonomous features for the instrument that aim at keeping the musician in an active and uncertain state of exploration. Through these new features, the instrument enables more accurate control on GAN latent space. Further, we intend to investigate the current developments through a musical composition that idiomatically reflects the new autonomous features of the AI-terity instrument. We argue that the present technology of AI is suitable for enabling alternative autonomous features in audio domain for the creative practices of musicians.}

In this paper, we present the Al-terity, a non-rigid musical instrument that comprises a deep learning model with generative adversarial network architecture and use it for generating audio samples for real-time audio synthesis. The particular deep learning model we use for this instrument was trained with existing data set as input for purposes of further experimentation. The main benefits of the model used are the ability to produce the realistic range of timbre of the trained data set and the ability to generate new audio samples in real-time, in the moment of playing, with the characteristics of sounds that the performer ever heard before. We argue that these advanced intelligence features on the audio synthesis level could allow us to explore performing music with particular response features that define the instrument's digital idiomaticity and allow us reinvent the instrument in the act of music performance.}

To evaluate PESI with skilled musicians,a user-test jam session was conducted. Musicians' comments indicate that thesystem facilitates group interaction finely to bring up further intentions tomusical ideas. Results from our user-test jam session indicate that, through some modificationof the 'in-space' response to the improvisation, and through more intuitiveinteractions with the 'on-body' mobile instruments, we could make thecollaborative music activity a more engaging and active experience. Despitebeing only user-tested once with musicians, the group interview has raisedfruitful discussions on the precise details of the system components.Furthermore, the paradigms of musical interaction and social actions in groupactivities need to be questioned when we seek design requirements for such acollaborative environment. We introduced a system that we believe can open upnew ways of musical exploration in group music activity with a number ofmusicians. The system brings up the affordances of accessible technologieswhile creating opportunities for novel design applications to be explored. Ourresearch proposes further development of the system, focusing on movementbehavior in long-term interaction between performers.

We hypothesized that a music beginner cannot determine tonal pitches of melody over a particular chord but can use body movements to specify the pitch contour (i.e., melodic outline) and the attack timings (i.e., rhythm). We aim to realize a performance interface for supporting expressing intuitive pitch contour and attack timings using body motion and outputting harmonious pitches over the chord progression of the background music. Since the intended users of this system are not limited to people with music experience, we plan to develop a system that uses Android smartphones, which many people have. Our system consists of three modules: a module for specifying attack timing using smartphone sensors, module for estimating the vertical movement of the smartphone using smartphone sensors, and module for estimating the sound height using smartphone vertical movement and background chord progression. Each estimation module is developed using long short-term memory (LSTM), which is often used to estimate time series data. We conduct evaluation experiments for each module. As a result, the attack timing estimation had zero misjudgments, and the mean error time of the estimated attack timing was smaller than the sensor-acquisition interval. The accuracy of the vertical motion estimation was 64\%, and that of the pitch estimation was 7.6\%. The results indicate that the attack timing is accurate enough, but the vertical motion estimation and the pitch estimation need to be improved for actual use.}

  abstract = {Musical performers need to show off their virtuosity for selfexpression and communicate with other people. Therefore, they are prepared to perform at any time and anywhere. However, a musical keyboard of 88 keys is too large and too heavy to carry around. When a portable keyboard that is suitable for carrying around is played over a wide range, the notes being played frequently cause the diapason of the keyboard to protrude. It is common to use Key Transpose in conventional portable keyboards, which shifts the diapason of the keyboard. However, this function creates several problems such as the feeling of discomfort from the misalignment between the keying positions and their output sounds. Therefore, the goal of our study is to construct Mobile Clavier, which enables the diapason to be changed smoothly. Mobile Clavier resolves the problems with Key Transpose by having black keys inserted between any two side-by-side white keys. This paper also discusses how effective Mobile Clavier was in an experiment conducted using professional pianists. We can play music at any time and anywhere with Mobile Clavier.},

In a decentralized mechanical instrument, musical memory is an emergent global property of the system, undistinguishable from the execution process. Such a machine is botha score andan instrument. The paper starts by discussing the difference between sequential memory systems and systems exhibiting emergent decentralized musical behavior. Next, the use of particle system simulation for exploring virtual decentralized instruments is demonstrated, and the architecture for a simple decentralized instrument is outlined. The paper continues by describing the use of a genetic algorithm for evolving decentralized instruments that reproduce a given musical behavior.}

We build upon previous work in sound-tracing and mapping-by-demonstration to ask the participants to design gestures with which to perform the given sounds using a multimodal, inertial measurement (IMU) and muscle sensing (EMG) device. We presented the user with four techniques for associating sensor input to synthesizer parameter output. Two were classical techniques from the literature, and two proposed different ways to capture dynamic gesture in a neural network. These four techniques were: 1.) A Static Position regression training procedure, 2.) A Hidden Markov based temporal modeler, 3.) Whole Gesture capture to a neural network, and 4.) a Windowed method using the position-based procedure on the fly during the performance of a dynamic gesture. Our results show trade-offs between accurate, predictable reproduction of the source sounds and exploration of the gesture-sound space. Several of the users were attracted to our new windowed method for capturing gesture anchor points on the fly as training data for neural network based regression. This paper will be of interest to musicians interested in going from sound design to gesture design and offers a workflow for quickly trying different mapping-by-demonstration techniques.}

Recent advances in electronics have made physiological computing applications practical and feasible. However, there is a gap between high end biomedical equipment and consumer DIY solutions. The hardware design we present here bridges this gap, and combines a specialized biosignal acquisition chip mated with a general-purpose microcontroller. It is based on the Texas Instruments ADS129x family a single chip integrated solution for high quality biosignal amplification and digitization. It serves as analogue front end via programmable gain amplifiers to a 24bit delta-sigma analog-digital converter. The microcontroller is the STMicroelectronics STM32F427, a Cortex-M4 family microcontroller with floating point unit . In addition to EMG acquisition, the board includes a Kionix KX122 three-axis accelerometer . The TI and Kionix sensing chipts communicate with the ST microcontroller over an I2C digital serial bus. The board communicates with the host computer or rest of the music system wirelessly over Bluetooth LE 4.2 using an ST SPBTLE-1S transceiver. The board can also communicate over USB where it registers with the host as a class compliant audio and MIDI device. Audio and physiological signals are treated in the same signal processing chain using the OWL framework. The demo will show multichannel EMG, and single channel EEG. We call this hybridization ``ExG''. We will present documentation of the EAVI board used in the lab and on stage, in user studies with neuro-diverse musicians and trained instrumentalists, as well as in performance with the experimental all-female band, Chicks on Speed.}

  abstract = {The lived body, or soma, is the designation for the phenomenological experience of being a body, rather than simply a corporeal entity. Bodily knowledge, which evolves through bodily awareness, carries the lived body's reflectivity. In this paper, such considerations are put in the context of previous work at NIME, specifically that revolving around with the vocal tract or the voice, due to its singular relation with embodiment. We understand that focusing on somaesthetics allows for novel ways of engaging with technology as well as highlighting biases that might go unnoticed otherwise. We present an inexpensive application of a respiration sensor that emerges from the aforementioned conceptualisations. Lastly, we reflect on how to better frame the role of bodily awareness in NIME.}

Embedded platforms are powerful technologies that changed the way we design and even think of DMIs. Their widespread adoption has popularized low-level audio programming, enabling engineers and artists alike to create highly responsive, self-contained digital musical instruments that have direct access to hardware resources. However, if we shift our focus away from the wealthy countries of the `Global North', embedded platforms become a commodity that only a few can afford. DMI researchers, artists and students from Latin America have discussed at great lengths the effects that the lack of access to these otherwise common resources have on their practices. And while some solutions have been proposed, a large gap can still be perceived. By means of appropriating possibly the most widespread and accessible technology in the world (Android) and turn it into an embedded platform, LDSP creates an effective opportunity to close this gap. Throughout the paper, we provide technical details of the full LDSP environment, along with insights on the surprising performances of the first DMIs that have been designed with it.}

Our research goal is to provide a tool kit of circuits for common synthesis elements based around the use of a single 40106 IC that may be of use to those involved in sound installations and frugal instrument design as well as practitioners working within accessibility and workshop/pedagogical scenarios. The authors demonstrate the application of the tool kit in their own projects, such as a monophonic synthesizer as well as several hand cranked sculptures that are powered and `played' by the interaction between the user and the hand crank. Overall, we gather a broad range of relevant information that is difficult to find in one place and provide a practical tool kit that is pitched at an introductory level and describe how this is incorporated into the design of interactive electronic instruments. We also attempt to highlight fundamental electronics and synthesis principles while embracing terminology common to both electronics and synthesizer communities.}

By converting rhythmic input into multimodal output, it creates an entangled ecosystem where the human body, digital musical instruments, and the Internet of Things intersect. Such a digital orality system could offer parents and practitioners a novel method for introducing children to literacy, STEAM skills and multimodal communication in the early years. I present design iterations of 1) a tangible rhythmic interface for digital drum talk inspired by the style of play of the Djembe, 2) a protocol for sending piezo sensor outputs over a custom PCB shield, which can be recognized across multiple platforms and web-based environments without additional customization; and 3) a suite of rhythm-based learning games using the Alphariddims multimodal symbol system based on the Morse code. I argue that such a culturally-grounded approach to music technology design provides a viable avenue for the preservation and revitalization of the vibrant, yet intangible, cultural heritage and traditions of the African talking drum cultural systems.}

In this study, we presented performers with an augmented electric guitar on which the gesture-to-sound relationship of downward bending gestures is changed depending on how the instrument is configured. Participants were asked to explore and perform a short improvisation under three different conditions, two augmentations that correspond to different auditory imagery and a constrained scenario. The different sessions of the experiment were recorded to conduct thematic analysis as an examination of how gestural disambiguation can be exploited in the design of augmentations that focus on reusing performer's expertise and how the gesture-to-sound entanglement of the different modalities supports or encumbers the performer's embodied relationship with the instrument.}

The constraints are applied in two forms: i) Physically implemented on the instruments themselves, and ii) hidden rules that are defined on a network between the instruments and triggered depending on the musical actions of the performers. Six experienced musicians were recruited for a user study which involved rehearsal and performance. Performers were given deliberately constrained instruments containing a touch sensor, speaker, battery and an embedded computer. Results of the study show that whilst constraints can lead to more structured improvisation, the resultant music may not fit with performers' true intentions. It was also found that when external musical material is introduced to guide the performers into a collective convergence, it is likely to be ignored because it was perceived by performers as being out of context.}

These musical agents were trained through machine learning to generate output in the style of the musicians. What happens to musical co-creation when AI is included in the creative cycle? The musicians are from Norway and Kenya---two countries with fundamen- tally different musical traditions. How is the collaboration affected by cultural biases inherent in the technology, and in the musicians themselves? These questions were examined through focus groups as part of two five-day workshops. An analysis shows how the musicians moved between an understanding of machine as tool and machine as co-creator, and between the idea of music as object and music as process. These different interpretative repertoires were used interchangeably and paint a complex picture of what it is like being in the intersection between different musical and cultural paradigms.}

The software utilizes corpora of solo instrumental performances encoded as self-organized maps and outputs slices of the corpora as concatenated, remodeled audio sequences. Transitions between behaviors can be automated, and the interface enables the negotiation of these transitions through feedback buttons that signal approval, force reversions to previous behaviors, or request change. Musical responses are embedded in a pre-trained latent space, emergent in the interaction, and influenced through the weighting of rhythmic, spectral, harmonic, and melodic features. The training and run-time modules utilize a modified version of the MASOM agent architecture. Our model stimulates spontaneous creativity and reduces the need for the user to sustain analytical mind frames, thereby optimizing flow. The agent traverses a system autonomy axis ranging from reactive to proactive, which includes the behaviors of shadowing, mirroring, and coupling. A fourth behavior---negotiation---is emergent from the interface between agent and user. The synergy of corpora, interactive modes, and influences induces musical responses along a musical similarity axis from converging to diverging. We share preliminary observations from experiments with the agent and discuss design challenges and future prospects.}

We present a dual-mode ASR that features a built-in microphone pickup and parametric control of mixing between sound diffusion and actuation modes for experiments with active acoustics and feedback. We document a modular approach to signal processing allowing quick adaptation and differentiation of control signals, and demonstrate rich sound processing techniques that create lively improvisation environments. By fostering participation and convergence among digital media practices and diverse musical cultures, we envision ASRs broadly rekindling creative practice for the violin, long a tool of improvisation before the triumph of classical works. ASRs decolonize the violin by activating new flows and connectivities, freeing up habitual relations, and refreshing the musical affordances of this otherwise quintessentially western and canonical instrument.}

Through a multiyear research-practice partnership (RPP), we collaborated with teaching fellows to co-design a curriculum for neurodiverse middle school students that activates computational thinking (CT). This collaboration led to a web-based, quasi-modular interface connected to wearable music sensors. We situate our work within the growing literature on participatory design of collaborative accessible digital musical instruments (CADMIs). We describe how our co-design methods address the complex demands of ecosystemic thinking, sensitive to the varied entanglements that complicate traditional human-computer interaction (HCI) design and evaluation methods. Our pedagogical and methodological approach diverges from deficit-focused strategies that aim to develop neurotypical communication skills in neurodivergent individuals. Instead, we promote cross-neurotype collaboration without presuming a single mode of "correct" communication. Furthermore, we surface the potential of CADMIs by linking this notion to a pluralization of agency that extends beyond one-to-one body-sensor relationships. We develop accessible instruments within neurodiversity and autism contexts, avoiding reification of mindbody relations and recognizing them as dynamic, field-like, and embedded in facilitative relations for these communities.}

One important task is evaluating the mood of acomposition for evoking accurate associations and memories of a soundscape. Anew system that uses supervised machine learning is presented for theacquisition and realtime feedback of soundscape affect. A model of sound-scape mood is created by users entering evaluations of audio environmentsusing a mobile device. The same device then provides feedback to the user ofthe predicted mood of other audio environments. We used a features vector ofTotal Loudness and MFCC extracted from an audio signal to build a multipleregression models.

  abstract = {Interacting with musical avatars have been increasingly popular over the years, with the introduction of games likeGuitar Hero and Rock Band. These games provide MIDIequipped controllers that look like their real-world counterparts (e.g. MIDI guitar, MIDI drumkit) that the users playto control their designated avatar in the game. The performance of the user is measured against a score that needs tobe followed. However, the avatar does not move in responseto how the user plays, it follows some predefined movementpattern. If the user plays badly, the game ends with theavatar ending the performance (i.e. throwing the guitar onthe floor). The gaming experience would increase if theavatar would move in accordance with user input. This paper presents an architecture that couples musical input withbody movement. Using imitation learning, a simulated human robot learns to play the drums like human drummersdo, both visually and auditory. Learning data is recordedusing MIDI and motion tracking. The system uses an artificial intelligence approach to implement imitation learning,employing artificial neural networks.},

Unlike other domain-specific languages for sound synthesis and audio processing, Stride can generate optimized code that can run on any supported hardware platform. The generated code can be compiled to run on a full featured operating system or bare metal on embedded devices. Stride goes further and enables a designer to consolidate various supported hardware and software platforms, define the communication between them, and target them as a single heterogeneous system.}

This opens new possibilities in termsof mapping. We kept our previous approach developed atARTeM [2]: wireless from the body to the host computer,but wired through a 4-wire digital bus on the body. Byrelieving the need for a transmitter on each sensing node,we could built very light and flat sensor nodes that can bemade invisible under the clothes. Smaller sensors, coupledwith flexible wires on the body, give more freedom of movement to dancers despite the need for cables on the body.And as the weight of each sensor node, box included, isonly 5 grams (Figure 1), they can also be put on the upper and lower arm and hand of a violin or viola player, toretrieve the skeleton from the torso to the hand, withoutadding any weight that would disturb the performer.

Borrowing the best from TidalCycles, Siren augments the pattern creation process by introducing various interface level features: a multi-channel sequencer, local and global parameters, mathematical expressions, and pattern history. It presents new opportunities for recording, refining, and reusing the playback information with the pattern roll component. Subsequently, the paper concludes with a preliminary evaluation of Siren in the context of user interface design principles, which originates from the cognitive dimensions framework for musical notation design.},

After having run a large study for understanding a listener's spontaneous rendering of form and movement, we built a number of digital instruments especially designed to emphasise a particular energy-motion profile. The evaluation through composition and performance indicates that this design paradigm can foster musical inventiveness and expression in the processes of composition and performance of gestural electronic music.}

After examining conventional approaches, we redefine spatialization tools as musical instruments challenging prevailing views of digital musical instruments confined to interface and synthesis components. Our exploration encompasses the projection, movement, and control of sound objects in diverse loudspeaker setups, emphasizing the reconnection of synthesis and space-related modulations. Addressing the multidimensional challenges associated with sound spatialization, we highlight some observed mapping strategies for the control of gestural and spatial information. In particular, we examine user-driven strategies, such as 'repurposed' controllers, 'interpreted' instruments, custom interfaces, and spatialized synthesis algorithms. Additionally, we introduce design patterns emphasizing an aesthetic standpoint, positioning music as space, advocating for the integration of loudspeaker topologies in the design process, and recoupling synthesis and spatialization. Illustrating our theoretical framework, we present three case studies of spatial digital musical instruments. These examples showcase the integration of spatialization with synthesis, offering a comprehensive approach to sound design. In conclusion, our exploration advocates for spatialization controller design strategies urging a transition to a more user-centric, adaptable, and holistic paradigm.}

Participants were filmed and interviewed for the later analysis of their different multimodal associations about music. Our initial hypothesis was that most of the physical mock-ups would be similar to the sound-producing objects that participants would identify in the musical pieces. Although the majority of artifacts clearly showed correlated design trajectories, our results indicate that a relevant number of participants intuitively decided to engineer alternative solutions emphasizing their personal design preferences. Therefore, in this paper we present and discuss the workshop format, its results and the possible applications for designing new musical interfaces.}

For this intention I developed a few classroom exercises which my students had to study and practice. During this period of five years, 95 students attended the course. At the end of the semester course, each student designed, built and performed a new interface for musical expression in front of an audience.

Rebuilding a DMI is often a necessary step to allow for performance with NIMEs. Rebuilding a DMI exactly similar to its original, however, might not be possible due to technology obsolescence, lack of documentation or other reasons. It might then be interesting to re-interpret a DMI and build an instrument inspired by the original one, creating novel performance opportunities. This paper presents the challenges and approaches involved in rebuilding and re-interpreting an existing DMI, The Sponge by Martin Marier. The rebuilt versions make use of newer/improved technology and customized design aspects like addition of vibrotactile feedback and implementation of different mapping strategies. It also discusses the implications of embedding sound synthesis within the DMI, by using the Prynth framework and further presents a comparison between this approach and the more traditional ground-up approach. As a result of the evaluation and comparison of the two rebuilt DMIs, we present a third version which combines the benefits and discuss performance issues with these devices.}

This paper will present the basic design philosophy behindWISEAR, explain some of the basic concepts and methods, aswell as provide a live demonstration of the running device, wornby the author.},

  abstract = {WISEAR (Wireless Sensor Array) is a Linux based Embeddedx86 TS-5600 SBC (Single Board Computer) specifically configured for use with music, dance and video performance technologies. The device offers a general purpose solution to many sensor and gestural controller problems. Much like the general purpose CPU, which resolved many issues of its predecessor (ie., the special purpose DSP chip), the WISEAR box attempts to move beyond custom made BASIC stamp projects that are often created on a per-performance basis and rely heavily on MIDI. WISEAR is both lightweight and wireless. Unlike several commercial alternatives, it is also a completely open source project. PAIR (Partnering Analysis in Real Time) exploits the power of WISEAR and revisits the potential of hardware-based systems for real-time measurement of bodily movement. Our goal was to create a robust yet adaptable system that could attend to both general and precise aspects of performer interaction. Though certain commonalities with existing hardware systems exist, our PAIR system takes a fundamentally different approach by focusing specifically on the interaction of two or more dancers.}

Applying spectral spatialization techniques to more than two channels introduces a few obstacles, particularly with controllers, visualization and the manipulation of large amounts of control data. Various interfaces are presented which address these issues. We also discuss 3D ``cube'' controllers and visualizations, which go a long way in aiding usability. A range of implementations were realized, each with its own interface, automation, and output characteristics. We also explore a number of novel techniques. For example, a sound's spectral components can be mapped in space based on its own components' energy, or the energy of another signal's components (a kind of spatial cross-synthesis). Finally, we address aesthetic concerns, such as perceptual and sonic coherency, which arise when sounds have been spectrally dissected and scattered across a multi-channel spatial field in 64, 128 or more spectral bands.}

Several DDMI have already been created, but they have been developed isolatedly, and there is still a lack of a common process of ideation and development. Knowledge about Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) and Interactive Dance Systems (IDSs) can contribute to the design of DDMI, but the former brings few contributions to the body's expressiveness, and the latter brings few references to an instrumental relationship with music. Because of those different premises, the integration between both paradigms can be an arduous task for the designer of DDMI. The conceptual framework of DDMI can also serve as a bridge between DMIs and IDSs, serving as a lingua franca between both communities and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. The conceptual framework has shown to be a promising analytical tool for the design, development, and evaluation of new digital dance and music instrument.}

This process was inspired by Paulo Freire's dialogical methods. It was conducted with community members of several ages and musical experience in a workshop over two months. The designed instruments were preliminary evaluated by community members in an informal context. The implications of this work, apart from creating instruments in conjunction with their final players, include an attempt to inspire a new bottom-up design process centered on existing communities situated in specific music cultures.}

We describe a direct sensing apparatus that can be used to achieve this. It is based on contact microphones and is informed by the specific characteristics of the Gyil. An alternative approach based on indirect acquisition is to apply polyphonic transcription on the signal acquired by a microphone without requiring the instrument to be modified. The direct sensing apparatus we have developed can be used to acquire ground truth for evaluating different approaches to polyphonic transcription and help create a ``surrogate'' sensor. Some initial results comparing different strategies to polyphonic transcription are presented.},

A piezoelectric pickup is mounted to the underside of the body of the instrument for direct audio acquisition providing a robust signal with little interference. The signal is used for electric sound-reinforcement, creative signal processing and audio analysis developed in Puredata (Pd). This signal inputs and outputs the micro computer via stereo 1/8th inch phono jacks. Sensors provide gesture recognition affording the performer a broader, more dynamic range of musical human computer interaction (MHCI) over specific DSP functions. Work has been done toward electromagnetic actuation of the tines, aiming to allow performer control and sensation via both traditional Lamellophone techniques, as well as extended playing techniques that incorporate shared human/computer control of the resulting sound. The goal is to achieve this without compromising the traditional sound production methods of the acoustic instrument while leveraging inherent performance gestures with embedded continuous controller values essential to MHCI. The result is an intuitive, performer designed, hybrid electro-acoustic instrument, idiomatic computer interface, and robotic acoustic instrument in one framework.}

They leverage the long training and skills of performers while simultaneously providing rich possibilities for digital control. Many existing hyper-instruments suffer from being one of a kind instruments that require invasive modifications to the underlying acoustic instrument. In this paper we focus on the pitched percussion family and describe a non-invasive sensing approach for extending them to hyper-instruments. Our primary concern is to retain the technical integrity of the acoustic instrument and sound production methods while being able to intuitively interface the computer. This is accomplished by utilizing the Kinect sensor to track the position of the mallets without any modification to the instrument which enables easy and cheap replication of the pro-posed hyper-instrument extensions. In addition we describe two approaches to higher-level gesture control that remove the need for additional control devices such as foot pedals and fader boxes that are frequently used in electro-acoustic performance. This gesture control integrates more organically with the natural flow of playing the instrument providing user selectable control over filter parameters, synthesis, sampling, sequencing, and improvisation using a commer-cially available low-cost sensing apparatus.}

Unlike most audiovisual works, Cymbalism was inspired by the creation of a series of interactive visual scenes that respond to the performer's real-time movements. In leading with the visual interaction, we discuss how this approach fostered a union between the physical, audio and visual elements of the work, creating a performance where the visualisation is not simply a feedback mechanism but fundamental in inspiring compositional concepts and new ways of interacting with sound. Through practice-based research, we use the insights gained through creative development and performance outcomes to guide the continued evolution of an established wearable gestural DMI.}

Applying the techniques of AFCs to different contexts, such as musical performance, sound installations, and product design, presents a unique insight into the research of embodied sonic interfaces and environments. This paper presents techniques that use digital acoustic feedback control algorithms to augment the sonic properties of environments and discusses approaches to the design of sonically playful experiences that apply such techniques. Three experimental prototypes are described to illustrate how the techniques can be applied to versatile environments and continuous coupling of users' audible actions with sonically augmented environments. The knowledge obtained from these prototypes has led to Acoustic Feedback Ecology System (AFES) design patterns. The paper concludes with some future research directions based on the prototypes and proposes several other potentially useful applications ranging from musical performance to everyday contexts.}

The created models learn the mapping between input and output images using a training set of either paired or unpaired images. We qualitatively assess the visual outcomes based on three image-to-image translation models: reconstructing interfaces from edge maps, and collection style transfers based on two image sets: visuals of mosaic tile patterns and geometric abstract two-dimensional arts.

Orphion achieves this by incorporating an interaction model based on tonally tuned virtual ``pads'' in user-configurable layouts, where the pitch and timbre associated with each pad depends on the initial point of touch, touch point size and size variation, and position after the initial touch. These parameters control a physical model for sound generation with visual feedback provided via the iPad display. We present findings from the research and development process including design revisions made in response to user testing. Finally, conclusions are made about the effectiveness of the instrument based on large-scale user feedback.}

More specifically the stimuli in the first study was designed to test the perceived similarity of six audio-visual associations, between the two mappings using three corpora resulting in 18 audio-visual stimuli. The corpora differ in terms of two sound characteristics: harmonic contain and continuity. Data analysis revealed no significant differences in the participant's responses between the three corpora, or between the two mappings. However highly significant differences were revealed between the individual audio-visual association pairs. The second study investigates the affects of the mapping and the corpus in the ability of the participants to detect which image out of three similar images was used to generate six audio stimuli. The data analysis revealed significant differences in the ability of the participants' to detect the correct image depending on which corpus was used. Less significant was the effect of the mapping in the success rate of the participant responses.}

The placement of sensors and the form factor of the device itself are suited for video games, not necessarily live music creation.

We claim that these two cases require different gesture-to-parameter mapping properties. Results are presented from a user experiment that motivates this theory. The experiment was conducted using a publicly available iPad app: ``Sonic Zoom''. Participants were encouraged to conduct an open ended exploration of synthesis timbre using a combination of two different interfaces. The first was a standard interface with ten sliders, hypothesised to be suited to the ``convergent'' stage of creation. The second was a mapping of the entire 10-D combinatorial space to a 2-D surface using a space filling curve. This novel interface was intended to support the ``divergent'' aspect of creativity. The paths of around 250 users through both 2-D and 10-D space were logged and analysed. Both the interaction data and questionnaire results show that the different interfaces tended to be used for different aspects of sound creation, and a combination of these two navigation styles was deemed to be more useful than either individually. The study indicates that the predictable, separate parameters found in most music technology are more appropriate for convergent tasks.}

Reunion2012, on the other hand, utilises magnet sensors via an Arduino.

Technical barriers still persist that limit this activity to exclusive groups capable of learning skillsets far removed from one's musical craft. These skills include programming, soldering, microprocessors, wireless protocols, and circuit design. Those of us whose creative activity is centered in NIME have to become polyglots of many disciplines to achieve our work. In the NIME community, it's unclear that we should even draw distinctions between 'artist' and 'technician', because these skillsets have become integral to our creative practice. However, what about the vast communities of musicians, composers, and artists who want to leverage sensing to take their craft into new territory with no background in circuits, soldering, embedded programming, and sensor function? eMersion, a plug-and-play, modular, wireless alternative solution for creating NIMEs will be presented.

After ten years of use, the halldorophone has a growing repertoire of works by prominent composers and performers. During the development of the instrument, the question has been asked: ``why do musicians want to use this instrument?'' and answers have been found through on-going (informal) user studies and feedback.

It continuously presents a predicted tone tothe user with both visual and audio feedback, thus makingit possible to design a plate with any desired shape and tone.We developed this system to demonstrate the effectivenessof integrating real-time finite element method analysis intogeometric editing to facilitate the design of custom-mademusical instruments. An informal study demonstrated theability of technically unsophisticated user to apply the system to complex metallophone design.},

  abstract = {Collaborative co-located Mixed Reality musical instruments combine some of the expressive opportunities of 3D interaction and communication and cooperation of physical multi-user instruments. However in existing instruments, the fixed coupling between the virtual and physical environments constrains the affordances brought by Mixed Reality, such as per-musician free navigation in or multi-scale control of virtual structures.We designed gRAinyCloud, as a way to reintegrate these lost affordances to a co-located instrument.It allows for the expressive exploration of a set of sounds represented by a virtual structure of shapes placed in the physical space and shared between musicians. Above all, gRAinyCloud enables each musician to freely manipulate their own viewpoint, changing its scale, position and rotation, effectively decoupling the physical and virtual spaces, and to switch between self, other's and absolute viewpoint while playing. We describe the implementation of this decoupling of spaces and analyse its uses and implications for collective musical expression, by relying on a first-person approach.}

The purpose of this research is to create a new listening experience by analyzing and extracting the performer's introspection of rests, groove, and rhythm, and physically presenting it to the audience. Although these elements are important in shaping music, they are not always directly expressed as auditory sounds. Our hypothesis is that this introspection, such as a sense of rhythm and groove, is latent and observable in physiological states such as breathing and heartbeat. By sensing and presenting them to the audience, music appreciation that includes introspection could become possible. In other words, by sensing and presenting introspection to the audience, the music listening experience itself can be redesigned to include a physicality that is closer to the performer's experience of the music, rather than being passive in an auditory sense. In this study, preliminary experiments were conducted on the extraction of the performer's introspection, and a device was designed to present it to the audience.}

This is something we know, performing these compositions keeps the characteristics of the instruments alive and able to survive. This paper presents our contribution to this discussion with a context and historical background for idiomatic compositions. Looking beyond the classical era, we discuss how the concept of idiomatic music has influenced research and composition practices in the NIME community; drawing more attention in the way current idiomatic composition practices considered specific NIME affordances for sonic, social and spatial interaction. We present particular projects that establish idiomatic writing as a part of a new repertoire for new musical instruments. The idiomatic writing approach to composing music for NIME can shift the unique characteristics of new instruments to a more established musical identity, providing a shared understanding and a common literature to the community.}

Unconventional Computing (UC) technologies explore non-digital ways of data storage, processing, input, and output. UC paradigms such as Quantum Computing and Biocomputing delve into domains beyond the binary bit to handle complex non-linear functions. In this paper, we harness Physarum polycephalum as memristors to process and generate creative data for popular music. While there has been research conducted in this area, the literature lacks examples of popular music and how the organism's non-linear behaviour can be controlled while composing music. This is important because non-linear forms of representation are not as obvious as conventional digital means. This study aims at disseminating this technology to non-experts and musicians so that they can incorporate it in their creative processes. Furthermore, it combines resistors and memristors to have more flexibility while generating music and optimises parameters for faster processing and performance.}

This paper explores the potential of building sound synthesisers with BCIs that are based on steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). It investigates novel ways to enable patients with motor disabilities to express themselves. It presents a new concept called sonic expression, that is to express oneself purely by the synthesis of sound. It introduces new layouts and designs for BCI-based sound synthesisers and the limitations of these interfaces are discussed. An evaluation of different sound synthesis techniques is conducted to find an appropriate one for such systems. Synthesis techniques are evaluated and compared based on a framework governed by sonic expression.}

The goal of this pipeline is to augment the traditional classical concert experience by giving listeners access, through the sense of touch, to an intimate and non-visible dimension of the musicians' bodily experience while performing. The live-stream pipeline produces vibrations based on muscle activity captured through surface electromyography (EMG). Therefore, MappEMG allows the audience to experience the performer's muscle effort, an essential component of music performance which is typically unavailable to direct visual observation. The paper is divided in four sections. First, we overview related works on EMG, music performance, and vibrotactile feedback. We then present conceptual and methodological issues of capturing musicians' muscle effort related to their expressive intentions. We further explain the different components of the live-stream data pipeline: a python software named Biosiglive for data acquisition and processing, a Max/MSP patch for data post-processing and mapping, and a mobile application named hAPPtiks for real-time control of smartphones' vibration. Finally, we address the application of the pipeline in an actual music performance. Thanks to their modular structure, the tools presented could be used in different creative and biomedical contexts involving gestural control of haptic stimuli.}

The flexibility of the PureJoy instrument offers to JamiOki the ability for any player to play any requested role in the music at any time. The musical structure provided by JamiOki helps PureJoy players create more complex pieces of music on the fly with spontaneous sounds, silences, themes, recapitulation, tight transitions, structural hierarchy, interesting interactions, and even friendly competition.

The core components of the system are: A software program to load, visualize and playback digitally encoded tracks; the HDDJ device (built chiefly out of a repurposed hard disk drive), which provides tactile manipulation of the playback speed and position of tracks; and the Cubic Crossfader, a wireless sensor cube that controls of the volume of individual tracks, and allows the DJ to mix these in interesting ways.},

We introduce five distinct hardware instances that serve as test cases for the Explorator genus. The hardware instances are introduced as Explorator ``species''. Each species shares core hardware and firmware systems but uses distinct soundscape augmentation feedback mechanisms to support unique installation scenarios. Initial subjective and objective observations, findings, and data are provided from fieldwork conducted in four American states.

With LED-based visual feedback and a cochlear loudspeaker-based vocalization system, Legatus seeks to capture attention and redirect it to the in-situ sonic environment. Informed by related historical and contemporary outdoor sonic installation artworks, we conceptualized and tested four installation scenarios in 2021. Installations were presented following a soundscape-specific pop-up exhibition strategy, where the exhibition venue and artifact placement are determined by in-situ sonic conditions. Legatus artifacts use high-level audio features and real-time environmental conditions including ambient temperature, humidity, and brightness levels to influence the timing and parameters of sample playback routines, audio synthesis, and audio recording. Having developed and tested for nine months, Legatus has emerged as a portable, rugged, affordable, adaptable, lightweight, and simple tool for augmenting natural sonic environments that can provide last-mile distributions of sonic installation art experiences to places and communities where these works are rarely exhibited.}

StrumBot improves upon previous RMI's by allowing additional expressive opportunities for a composer to utilise. StrumBot can perform slides, vibrato, muting techniques, pitch bends, pluck power variances, timbre control, complex chords and fast strumming patterns. A MIDI input allows commercial or custom controllers to operate StrumBot. Novel note allocation algorithms were created to allow a single MIDI stream of notes to be allocated across the six guitar strings. Latency measurements from MIDI input to string pluck are as low as 40 ms for a best case scenario strum, allowing StrumBot to accompany a live musician with minimal audible delay. A relay based loop switcher is incorporated, allowing StrumBot to activate standard commercial guitar pedals based on a MIDI instruction.},

This is done by using a database of multimodal motion data collected from multiple subjects coupled with sound synthesis parameters. A series of sound stimuli is synthesised using the sound engine that will be used in performance. Multimodal motion data is collected by asking each participant to listen to each sound stimulus and move as if they were producing the sound using a musical instrument they are given. Multimodal data is recorded during each performance, and paired with the synthesis parameters used for generating the sound stimulus. The dataset created using this method is then used to build a topological representation of the performance movements of the subjects. This representation is then used to interactively generate training data for machine learning algorithms, and define mappings for real-time performance. To better illustrate each step of the procedure, we describe an implementation involving clarinet, motion capture, wearable sensor armbands, and waveguide synthesis.}

The prototype aims at supporting musicians to create rhythmic patterns in the context of EDM production and live performances. Starting with a seed pattern which is provided by the user, a list of variations with varying degree of deviation from the seed pattern is generated. The interface provides simple ways to enter, edit, visualize and browse through the patterns. Variations are generated by means of an artificial neural network which is trained on a database of drum rhythm patterns extracted from a commercial drum loop library. To evaluate the user interface and pattern generation quality a user study with experts in EDM production was conducted. It was found that participants responded positively to the user interface and the quality of the generated patterns. Furthermore, the experts consider the prototype helpful for both studio production situations and live performances.}

The deeper understanding of the expressive gestural variations permits to define the confidence bounds of the expert's gestures, which are used during the decoding phase of the recognition. The first experiments show promising results in terms of recognition accuracy and temporal alignment between template and performed gesture, which leads to a better fluidity and immediacy and thus gesture sonification.},

Of particular interest is how musicians interact with a separate machine entity that exercises agency over the creative process. The use of real-world metaphors as a strategy for increasing audience engagement is also discussed. The composition and system Church Belles is presented, analyzed and evaluated in terms of its architecture, how it relates to existing studies of musician-machine creative interaction and how the use of a real-world metaphor can promote audience perceptions of liveness. This develops previous NIME work by offering a detailed case study of the development process of both a system and a piece for popular, non-improvisational vocal/guitar music.},

A brief review of the literature discusses text-based generative systems, links between typing and playing percussion instruments and the use of typing gestures in contemporary performance practice. The paper then documents the author's audio-visual system that is driven by the typing of text/lyrics in real-time. It is argued that the system promotes the sensation of liveness through clear, perceptible links between the performer's gestures, the system's audio outputs and the its visual outputs. The system also provides a novel approach to the use of generative techniques in the composition and live performance of songs. Future developments would include the use of dynamic text effects linked to sound generation and greater interaction between human performer and the visuals.}

The editor utilizes the Parsing Expression Grammar formalism for language design, and a virtual machine featuring collaborative multitasking for execution, in order to support a diversity of language concepts and affordances. The editor is coupled with online tutorial documentation aimed at the computer music community, with live examples embedded. This paper documents the design and use of the editor and its underlying virtual machine.}

This paper highlights the variety and importance of musical interface-related research between the mid-1970s and 2000 published in two major computer music research venues: the International Computer Music Conference and the Computer Music Journal. It discusses some early examples of research on musical interfaces published in these venues, then reviews five other sources of related literature that pre-date the original NIME CHI workshop. It then presents a series of implications of this research and introduces a collaborative website that compiles many of these references in one place. This work is meant as a step into a more inclusive approach to interface design by facilitating the integration of as many relevant references as possible into future NIME research.}

Yet few works consider whether and how the design of the NIME will be affected given the technology's affordance. In this paper, we take an autobiographical design approach to design a NIME in HMAR, exploring what is a genuine application of AR in a NIMEs and how AR mediates between the performer and sound as a creative expression. Three interface prototypes are created for a frequency modulation synthesis system. We report on their design process and our learning and experiences through self-usage and improvisation. Our designs explore free-hand and embodied interaction in our interfaces, and we reflect on how these unique qualities of HMAR contribute to an expressive medium for sonic creation.}

This result shows that force input is a potentially feasible for browsing through a vowel space for an articulatory voice synthesis system, although further evaluation is required.},

Head-mounted mixed reality computers present opportunities for natural gestural control in three dimensions, particularly when using hand-tracking in a creative interface.

We are yet to see widespread adoption of head-mounted AR musical instruments. We conducted an empirical study to evaluate musicians' (N=20) experience of performing with a freehand musical interface. The results suggest that the design of freehand musical interaction in the AR space is highly learnable and explorable, and that such systems can leverage unique aspects of mobility, space and sound to deliver an engaging and playful musical experience. The mobile musical experience with a spatial interface design allowed performers to be more bodily engaged and facilitated gestural exploration for musical creativity.

Because of the fundamental powers of programming languages, we believe the technical and aesthetic aspects of on-the-fly programming are worth exploring. In this paper, we present a formalized framework for on-the-fly programming, based on the ChucK synthesis language, which supports a truly concurrent audio programming model with sample-synchronous timing, and a highly on-the-fly style of programming. We first provide a well-defined notion of on-thefly programming. We then address four fundamental issues that confront the on-the-fly programmer: timing, modularity, conciseness, and flexibility. Using the features and properties of ChucK, we show how it solves many of these issues. In this new model, we show that (1) concurrency provides natural modularity for on-the-fly programming, (2) the timing mechanism in ChucK guarantees on-the-fly precision and consistency, (3) the Chuck syntax improves conciseness, and (4) the overall system is a useful framework for exploring on-the-fly programming. Finally, we discuss the aesthetics of on-the-fly performance.},

Then we perform three complementary tests on BLE MIDI and alternative interfaces using prototype and commercial devices, showing that BLE MIDI has comparable performance with the tested WiFi implementations, with end-to-end (sensor input to audio output) latencies of under 10ms under certain conditions. Overall, BLE MIDI is an ideal choice for controllers and sensor interfaces that are designed to work on a wide variety of platforms.}

  abstract = {ChucK is a programming language for real-time sound synthesis. It provides generalized audio abstractions and precise control over timing and concurrency --- combining the rapid-prototyping advantages of high-level programming tools, such as Pure Data, with the flexibility and controllability of lower-level, text-based languages like C/C++. In this paper, we present a new time-based paradigm for programming controllers with ChucK. In addition to real-time control over sound synthesis, we show how features such as dynamic patching, on-the-fly controller mapping, multiple control rates, and precisely-timed recording and playback of sensors can be employed under the ChucK programming model. Using this framework, composers, programmers, and performers can quickly write (and read/debug) complex controller/synthesis programs, and experiment with controller mapping on-the-fly.},

The development is described in two parts. Firstly, we consider the design of the interface or physical controller. Following this we describe the development of a specific sonic character, mapping approach and performance. In both these parts an explicit consideration of the type of movement we would like the device to engender in performance drove the design choices. By considering these two parts separately we draw attention to two different levels at which movement might be considered in the design of DMIs; at a general level of ranges of movement in the creation of the controller and a more specific, but still quite open, level in the creation of the final instrument and a particular performance. In light of the results of this process the limitations of existing representations of movement within the DMI design discourse is discussed. Further, the utility of a movement focused design approach is discussed.}

Modular synthesis has been a prominent platform for exploring automation through the use of sequencers and has therefore fostered a tradition of user interface design utilizing increasingly complex abstraction methods. We investigate the history of sequencer design from this perspective and introduce machine learning as a potential source for a new type of intelligent abstraction. We then offer a case study based on this approach and present Latent Drummer, which is a prototype system dedicated to integrating machine learning-based interface abstractions into the tradition of sequencers for modular synthesis.}

These are produced by a neural network that ensures that (with high probability) the melodic and rhythmic structure of the new melody is consistent with a given set of sample songs. We train a Variational Autoencoder network to identify a low-dimensional set of variables that allows for the compression and representation of sample songs. By perturbing these variables with Perlin Noise---a temporally-consistent parameterized noise function---it is possible to generate smoothly-changing novel melodies. We show that (1) by regulating the amount of noise, one can specify how much of the base song will be preserved; and (2) there is a direct correlation between the noise signal and the differences between the statistical properties of novel melodies and the original one. Users can interpret the controllable noise as a type of "creativity knob": the higher it is, the more leeway the network has to generate significantly different melodies. We present a physical prototype that allows musicians to use a keyboard to provide base melodies and to adjust the network's "creativity knobs" to regulate in real-time the process that proposes new melody ideas.}

The OWL is a dedicated, programmable audio device designed to provide an alternative to the use of laptop computers for bespoke audio processing on stage for music performance. By creating a software framework that allows the user to program their own code for the hardware in C++, the OWL project makes it possible to use homemade audio processing on stage without the need for a laptop running a computer music environment such as Pure Data or Supercollider. Moving away from the general-purpose computer to a dedicated audio device means that some of the potential problems and technical complexity of performing with a laptop computer onstage can be avoided, allowing the user to focus more of their attention on the musical performance. Within the format of a traditional guitar 'stomp box', the OWL aims to integrate seamlessly into a guitarist's existing pedal board setup, and in this way presents as an example of a ubiquitous and tangible computing device -a programmable computer designed to fit into an existing mode of musical performance whilst being transparent in use.}

When multiple Beatbugs are connected in a network, players can form large-scale collaborative compositions by interdependently sharing and developing each other's motifs. Each Beatbug player can enter a motif that is then sent through a stochastic computerized "Nerve Center" to other players in the network. Receiving players can decide whether to develop the motif further (by continuously manipulating pitch, timbre, and rhythmic elements using two bend sensor antennae) or to keep it in their personal instrument (by entering and sending their own new motifs to the group.) The tension between the system's stochastic routing scheme and the players' improvised real-time decisions leads to an interdependent, dynamic, and constantly evolving musical experience. A musical composition entitled "Nerve" was written for the system by author Gil Weinberg. It was premiered on February 2002 as part of Tod Machover's Toy Symphony [1] in a concert with the Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin, conducted by Kent Nagano. The paper concludes with a short evaluative discussion of the concert and the weeklong workshops that led to it.},

  abstract = {Motivated by challenges involved in the long-term maintenance of digital musical instruments, the frustrating problem of glue code, and the inherent complexity of evaluating new instruments, we developed Sygaldry, a C++20 library of digital musical instrument components. By emphasising the development of components first and foremost, and through use of C++20 language features, strict management of dependencies, and literate programming, Sygaldry provides immediate benefits to rapid prototyping, maintenance, and replication of DMIs, encourages code portability and code-reuse, and reduces the burden of glue-code in DMI firmware. Recognising that there still remains significant future work, we discuss the advantages of focusing development and research on DMI components rather than individual DMIs, and argue that a modern C++ library is among the most appropriate realisations of these efforts.}

Multi-layer fabric sensors that detect touch, proximity, electric field, pressure, and stretch are machine-sewn in a keyboard pattern on a stretchable substrate. The result is a fabric-based musical controller that combines both the discrete controls of a keyboard and various continuous controls from the embedded fabric sensors. This enables unique tactile experiences and new interactions both with physical and non-contact gestures: physical by pressing, pulling, stretching, and twisting the keys or the fabric and non-contact by hovering and waving towards/against the keyboard and an electromagnetic source. We have also developed additional fabric-based modular interfaces such as a ribbon-controller and trackpad, allowing performers to add more expressive and continuous controls. This paper will discuss implementation strategies for our system-on-textile, fabric-based sensor developments, as well as sensor-computer interfacing and musical mapping examples of this multi-modal and expressive fabric keyboard.}

This paper presents a novel way of interaction with a modular synthesizer by exploring the affordances of cord-base UIs. A special patch cable was developed us- ing commercially available piezo-resistive rubber cords, and was adapted to fit to the 3.5 mm mono audio jack, making it compatible with the Eurorack modular-synth standard. Moreover, a module was developed to condition this stretch- able sensor/cable, to allow multiple Patch-cordes to be used in a given patch simultaneously. This paper also presents a vocabulary of interactions, labeled through various physical actions, turning the patch cable into an expressive controller that complements traditional patching techniques.}

Influenced by roadworthy analog gear, chief system requirements were mobility, plug-and-play, reliability, and low cost. From 2007 to 2011, this first iteration "Cabled Madness" melded rock music with realtime algorithmic composition and revolved around cyborg human/system tension, aspects of improvisation, audience feedback, and an inherent capability of failure. The second iteration "Onward to Mars" explored storytelling from 2012-2015 through the one-way journey of the first human on Mars with the computing system adapted into a self-contained spacesuit backpack. Now 10 years on, a new robotcowboy 2.0 system powers a third iteration with only an iPhone and PdParty, the author's open-source iOS application which runs Pure Data patches and provides full duplex stereo audio, MIDI, HID game controller support, and Open Sound Control communication.

The percussive output normally associated with the rubboard is captured through piezo contact sensors mounted directly on the keys (the playing implements). Additionally,mode functionality is controlled by discrete switching on the keys.This new instrument is meant to be easily played by both experienced players and those new to the rubboard. It lends itself to an expressive freedom by placing the control surface on the chest and allowing the hands to move uninhibited about it or by playing it in the usual way, preserving its musical heritage.},

The tempo, melody, and timbral features of the generated music are modulated according to biosensor input from each runner using a wearable Bluetooth sensor. We compare the relative performance of athletes listening to heart-rate and cadence synchronous music, across a randomized trial (N=57) on a trail course with 76ft of elevation. Participants were instructed to continue until perceived effort went beyond an 18 using the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale. We found that cadence-synchronous music improved performance and decreased perceived effort in male runners, and improved performance but not perceived effort in female runners, in comparison to heart-rate synchronous music. This work has implications for the future design and implementation of novel portable music systems and in music-assisted coaching.}

The timbre morphing system is used to transform live input captured at each sculpture with a discrete microphone array, by morphing towards noisy source signals that have been associated with each sculpture as part of a pre-determined musical structure. The resulting morphed audio is then fed-back to the gallery via a five-channel speaker array. Visitors are encouraged to walk freely through the installation and interact with the sound world, creating unique audio morphs based on their own movements, voices, and incidental sounds.}

Wearable gestural sensors have proved integral components of many past NIMEs. Previous implementations have typically made use of specialist, IMU and EMG based gestural technologies. Few have proved, singularly, as popular as the Myo armband. An informal review of the NIME archives found that the Myo has featured in 21 NIME publications, since an initial declaration of the Myo's promise as ``a new standard controller in the NIME community'' by Nyomen et al. in 2015. Ten of those found were published after the Myo's discontinuation in 2018, including three as recently as 2022. This paper details an assessment of smartwatch-based IMU and audio logging as a ubiquitous, accessible alternative to the IMU capabilities of the Myo armband. Six violinists were recorded performing a number of exercises using VioLogger; a purpose-built application for the Apple Watch. Participants were simultaneously recorded using a Myo armband and a freestanding microphone. Initial testing upon this pilot dataset indicated promising results for the purposes of audio-gestural analysis; both implementations demonstrated similar efficacy for the purposes of MLP-based bow-stroke classification.}

Throughout the curation of this project, each creative act has enabled us to contextualise, examine and reflect upon the design of this augmented instrument. In accordance with Stolterman and Wiberg's concept driven design methodology, we do not present a singular instrument design, but instead an overarching design concept alongside its developmental and evaluative narrative. This augmentation centres upon the use of a drum trigger and a tactile transducer, which when coupled together can be used to feedback or resonate a drum. The resultant soundworld develops upon the idiomatic sonority of a drum, and allows for the duration and timbre of a drum strike to be continuously manipulated and shaped throughout a performance. In exploring the soundworld which results from this approach, we have experimented with numerous configurations of these pieces of hardware, and have also employed various pieces of software to parametrise the sonic subtleties that this approach engenders. Most prominently, we have developed a bespoke piece of software which analyses the modes of a drum prior to performance, and uses this modal analysis to shape the overall feedback and resonance. Throughout this design process, we have consistently been met with new creative criteria that challenge our approach and ideas, in response to the particularities of the musicians we are working alongside, as well as the performative and aesthetic environments we are working within.}

Each player's gestures with the instrument were sketched, categorised and compared with those of others among the group. Additionally, sensor data from the instruments was recorded and analysed to give a secondary indication of playing style, based on note and silence durations. In accord with previous studies, the high degree of constraints led to a diverse range of playing styles, allowing each player to appropriate and explore the instruments within a short inaugural session. The open, undirected sessions also provided insights which could potentially direct future work based on each person's responses to the instruments. The paper closes with a short discussion of these diverse styles, and the potential role constrained ADMIs could serve as 'ice-breakers' in musical projects that seek to co-produce or co-design with neurodiverse children and young people.}

A small scale review covers systems from two prominent UK-based companies, and two itera- tions of a new prototype system that were developed in collaboration with a small group of young people on the autistic spectrum. Amongst these technologies, the aspects of musical experience that are made accessible differ with re- spect to the extent and nature of each system's constraints. It is argued that the design-constraints of the new prototype system facilitated the diverse playing styles and techniques observed during its development. Based on these obser- vations, we propose that deliberately constrained musical instruments may be one way of providing more opportuni- ties for the emergence of personal practices and preferences in neurodiverse groups of children and young people, and that this is a fitting subject for further research.}

Participants viewed all six songs with either the original or desynchronized soundtrack (Experiment 1), or either the original or inverted-mapping soundtrack (Experiment 2). Participants were asked several questions via questionnaire after each song. Overall, they reported higher engagement and preference for the original versions, suggesting that audiences of the TSPW prefer more highly synchronized performances, as well as more intuitive mappings, though level of perceived expression of the performer only significantly differed in Experiment 1. Further, we believe that our experimental methods contribute to how DMIs can be evaluated from the audience's (a recently noted underrepresented stakeholder) perspective.},

By leveraging the Erhu's expressive techniques, we develop a dual-hand spatial interaction framework using real-time gesture tracking. Hand movement data is mapped to sound synthesis parameters to control pitch, timbre, and dynamics, while a differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) model, trained on a custom Erhu dataset, transforms basic waveforms into authentic timbre which remians sincere to the instrument's nuanced articulations. The system bridges traditional musical aesthetics with digital interactivity, emulating Erhu bowing dynamics and expressive techniques through embodied interaction. The study contributes a novel framework for digitizing Erhu performance practices, explores methods to align culturally informed gestures with DDSP-based synthesis, and offers insights into preserving traditional instruments within digital music interfaces.}

Two problems are addressed: 1) the sensor cannot detect overlapping hands 2) The sensor's limited detection range. Training examples included 7 kinds of overlapping hand gestures as well as hand trajectories where a hand goes out of the sensor's range. The overlapping gestures were treated as a classification problem and the best performing model was k-nearest neighbors with 62\% accuracy. The out-of-range problem was treated first as a clustering problem to group the training examples into a small number of trajectory types, then as a classification problem to predict trajectory type based on the hand's motion before going out of range. The best performing model was k-nearest neighbors with an accuracy of 30\%. The prediction models were implemented in an ongoing multimedia electroacoustic vocal performance and an educational project named Embodied Sonic Meditation (ESM).}

While prior works have investigated the design of gestural input for deformable interfaces and developed novel musical interactions, there remains a gap in understanding the tangible gestures as input and their corresponding output from the user's perspectives. This study explores the relationship between gestural input and the output of a deformable interface for multi-gestural music interaction. Following a pilot study to explore materials and their corresponding intuitive gestures with participants, we develop a TPU fabric interface as a probe to investigate this question in the context of musical interaction. Through user engagement with the probe as a sound control, we discovered that the input-output relationship between gestures and the sound can have meaningful implications for users' embodied interaction with the system. Our research deepens the understanding of designing deformable interfaces and their capacity to enhance embodied experiences in music interaction scenarios.}

Participants generated a musical signal by manipulating a hand-held device with two dimensions of control over two parameters, pitch and density of note events, and were given the task of following a target pattern as closely as possible. The target pattern was a machine-generated musical signal comprising of variation over the same two parameters. Visual feedback provided participants with information about the control parameters of the musical signal generated by the machine. We measured the task performance under different visual feedback strategies. Results show that single parameter visualizations tend to improve the tracking performance with respect to the visualized parameter, but not the non-visualized parameter. Visualizing two independent parameters simultaneously decreases performance in both dimensions.},

Most of the studies on which vibrotactile sensitivity are based have been conducted using sine tones delivered by point-contact actuators. The current study was designed to investigate vibrotactile sensitivity using complex signals and full, open-hand contact with a flat vibrating surface representing more natural environmental conditions. Sensitivity to frequencies considerably higher than previously reported was demonstrated for all the signal types tested. Furthermore, complex signals seem to be more easily detected than sine tones, especially at low frequencies. Our findings are applicable to a general understanding of sensory physiology, and to the development of new vibrotactile display devices for music and other applications.},

  abstract = {An emerging approach to building new musical instruments is based on training neural networks to generate audio conditioned upon parametric input. We use the term "generative models" rather than "musical instruments" for the trained networks because it reflects the statistical way the instruments are trained to "model" the association between parameters and the distribution of audio data, and because "musical" carries historical baggage as a reference to a restricted domain of sound. Generative models are musical instruments in that they produce a prescribed range of sound playable through the expressive manipulation of an interface. To learn the mapping from interface to audio, generative models require large amounts of parametrically labeled audio data. This paper introduces the Synthetic Audio Textures (Syn- Tex1) collection of data set generators. SynTex is a database of parameterized audio textures and a suite of tools for creating and labeling datasets designed for training and testing generative neural networks for parametrically conditioned sound synthesis. While there are many existing labeled speech and traditional musical instrument databases available for training generative models, most datasets of general (e.g. environmental) audio are oriented and labeled for the purpose of classification rather than expressive musical generation. SynTex is designed to provide an open shareable reference set of audio for creating generative sound models including their interfaces. SynTex sound sets are synthetically generated. This facilitates dense and accurate labeling necessary for conditionally training generative networks conditionally dependent on input parameter values. SynTex has several characteristics designed to support a data-centric approach to developing, exploring, training, and testing generative models.}

We refer to this context-dependent decisions as situated musical actions. Here, we present directions for designing a customisable virtual companion to help live coders in their practice. In particular, we introduce a machine learning (ML) model that, based on a set of examples provided by the live coder, filters the crowdsourced sounds retrieved from the Freesound online database at performance time. We evaluated a first illustrative model using objective and subjective measures. We tested a more generic live coding framework in two performances and two workshops, where several ML models have been trained and used. We discuss the promising results for ML in education, live coding practices and the design of future NIMEs.}

We believe that we are barely at the tip of the iceberg and that we can explore further the possibilities of the medium by promoting a more active role of the audience during telematic performance. In this paper, we present personic, a mobile web app designed for distributed audiences to constitute a digital musical instrument. This has the twofold purpose of letting the audience contribute to the performance with a non-intrusive and easy-to-use approach, as well as providing audiovisual feedback that is helpful for both the performers and the audience alike. The challenges and possibilities of this approach are discussed from pilot testing the app using a practice-based approach. We conclude by pointing to new directions of telematic performance, which is a promising direction for network music and digital performance.}

Thus, a new audience-centric musical genre has emerged, which aligns with artistic manifestations where there is an explicit inclusion of the public (e.g. participatory art, cinema or theatre). Previous research has focused on analysing this new genre from historical, social organisation and technical perspectives. This follow-up paper contributes with reflections on technical and aesthetic aspects of composing within this audience-centric approach. We propose a set of 13 composition dimensions that deal with the role of the performer, the role of the audience, the location of sound and the type of feedback, among others. From a reflective approach, four participatory pieces developed by the authors are analysed using the proposed dimensions. Finally, we discuss a set of recommendations and challenges for the composers-developers of this new and promising musical genre.

In this paper, we explore the possibility of learning some basic music performance skills from rehearsal data. In particular, we consider the piano duet scenario where two musicians expressively interact with each other. Our work extends previous automatic accompaniment systems. We have built an artificial pianist that can automatically improve its ability to sense and coordinate with a human pianist, learning from rehearsal experience. We describe different machine learning algorithms to learn musicianship for duet interaction, explore the properties of the learned models, such as dominant features, limits of validity, and minimal training size, and claim that a more human-like interaction is achieved.}

An important innovation is the ability to learn how the improvised accompaniment should respond to variations in the melody performance, using tempo and embellishment complexity as features, resulting in a truly interactive performance within a conventional musical framework. We conducted both objective and subjective evaluations, showing that the learned improviser performs more interactive, musical, and human-like accompaniment compared with the less responsive, rule-based baseline algorithm.}

In this study, we contribute Interactive Rainbow Score, an interactive visual system to boost the learning of sight-playing, the general musical skill to read music and map the visual representations to performance motions. The key design of Interactive Rainbow Score is to associate pitches (and the corresponding motions) with colored notation and further strengthen such association via real-time interactions. Quantitative results show that the interactive feature on average increases the learning efficiency by 31.1\%. Further analysis indicates that it is critical to apply the interaction in the early period of learning.}

Haptic interfaces open another door to the music world for the vast majority of talentless beginners when traditional training methods are not effective. However, the existing haptic interfaces can only be used to learn specially designed pieces with great restrictions on duration and pitch range due to the fact that it is only feasible to guide a part of performance motion haptically for most instruments. Our study breaks such restrictions using a semi-haptic guidance method. For the first time, the pitch range of the haptically learned pieces go beyond an octave (with the fingering motion covers most of the possible choices) and the duration of learned pieces cover a whole phrase. This significant change leads to a more realistic instrument learning process. Experiments show that semi-haptic interface is effective as long as learners are not ``tone deaf''. Using our prototype device, the learning rate is about 30\% faster compared with learning from videos.},

  abstract = {This study explores new possibilities for transforming perceived space by using an umbrella as a dynamic spatial auditory interface. While spatial audio technologies have been widely applied across various domains, there are few opportunities in daily life to consciously perceive the boundary between personal and external space. Due to its physical structure and everyday usage, the umbrella has a unique ability to render such boundaries perceptible.Focusing on the ``flow'' of raindrops across the umbrella's surface, the system detects continuous rain movement in real time rather than merely capturing impact sounds. Spatial auditory feedback encourages users to actively perceive dynamic spatial boundaries, as the rain draws auditory contours through interaction with the umbrella.To this end, the umbrella is conceptualized as an interactive interface that senses raindrop movement and applies spatial audio processing. In addition, users can dynamically alter the virtual size of the umbrella, enabling perceptual shifts in spatial scale.Rather than treating the umbrella as a mere protective object, this system reimagines it as a medium for perceiving environmental change through sound. By integrating natural phenomena with spatial audio, this approach suggests new directions for embodied perception and expression.}

We developed a ball-shaped interface, TwinkleBall, to achieve the free-style performance. A photo sensor is embedded in the translucent rubber ball to detect the grasping force of the performer. The grasping force is translated into the luminance intensity for processing. Moreover, an accelerometer is also embedded in the interface for motion sensing. By using these sensors, a performer can control the note and volume by varying grasping force and motion respectively. The features of the proposed interface are ball-shaped, wireless, and handheld size. As a result, the proposed interface is able to generate the sound from the body expression such as dance.},

Our system searches for a portion of the registered lyrics whose vowel sequence matches the current user input using the probabilistic model, and sends the matched lyrics to the singing voice synthesizer. The vowel input keys are mapped onto a standard musical keyboard, enabling experienced keyboard players to learn the system from a standard musical score.

It firstly uses deep neural network models for hand key point detection to obtain gesture information, secondly maps it to pitch, chord or other information based on the current mode, then passes it to Max/MSP via the OSC protocol, and finally implements the generation and processing of MIDI or audio. MuGeVI is now available in four modes: performance mode, accompaniment mode, control mode, and audio effects mode, and can be conveniently used with just a personal computer with a camera. Designed to be human-centric, MuGeVI is feature-rich, simple to use, affordable, scalable and programmable, and is certainly a frugal musical innovation.

  abstract = {The Rulers is a Digital Musical Instrument with 7 metal beams, each of which is fixed at one end. It uses infrared sensors, Hall sensors, and strain gauges to estimate deflection. These sensors each perform better or worse depending on the class of gesture the user is making, motivating sensor fusion practices. Residuals between Kalman filters and sensor output are calculated and used as input to a recurrent neural network which outputs a classification that determines which processing parameters and sensor measurements are employed. Multiple instances (30) of layer recurrent neural networks with a single hidden layer varying in size from 1 to 10 processing units were trained, and tested on previously unseen data. The best performing neural network has only 3 hidden units and has a sufficiently low error rate to be good candidate for gesture classification. This paper demonstrates that: dynamic networks out-perform feedforward networks for this type of gesture classification, a small network can handle a problem of this level of complexity, recurrent networks of this size are fast enough for real-time applications of this type, and the importance of training multiple instances of each network architecture and selecting the best performing one from within that set.}

However, one of the greatest challenges in mechatronic music is to enable these robots to deliver a nuanced and expressive performance. This depends on their capability to integrate dynamics, articulation, and a variety of ornamental techniques while playing a given musical passage. In this paper we introduce a robot arm pitch shifter for a mechatronic monochord prototype. This is a fast, precise, and mechanically quiet system that enables sliding techniques during musical performance. We discuss the design and construction process, as well as the system's advantages and restrictions. We also review the quantitative evaluation process used to assess if the instrument meets the design requirements. This process reveals how the pitch shifter outperforms existing configurations, and potential areas of improvement for future work.}

Assuming that a singing voice is a kind of musical expression, natural expressions of the singing voice are important for personification. We adopt a singing voice morphing algorithm that effectively smoothes out the strength of expressions delivered with a singing voice. The system's hand puppet consists of a glove with seven bend sensors and two pressure sensors. It sensitively captures the user's motion as a personified puppet's gesture. To synthesize the different expressional strengths of a singing voice, the ``normal'' (without expression) voice of a particular singer is used as the base of morphing, and three different expressions, ``dark,'' ``whisper'' and ``wet,'' are used as the target. This configuration provides musically expressed controls that are intuitive to users. In the experiment, we evaluate whether 1) the morphing algorithm interpolates expressional strength in a perceptual sense, 2) the handpuppet interface provides gesture data at sufficient resolution, and 3) the gestural mapping of the current system works as planned.},

In order to provide this insight into the subtleties of bow articulation, a sensing system has been integrated into a commercial carbon fiber bow to measure changes in position, acceleration, and the downward and lateral strains of the bow stick. The sensors were fashioned using an electromagnetic field sensing technique, commercial MEMS accelerometers, and foil strain gauges. The measurement techniques used in this work were found to be quite sensitive and yielded sensors that were easily controllable by a player using traditional right hand bowing technique.},

Applying a music orientated analysis of this type enabled the investigative process to not only take place over a comprehensive period, but allowed for the exploration of DMI integration in everyday compositional practices.

Drawing inspiration from the original theremin and the extensive instrument collection of Leon Theremin, Bare\"emins represent a fusion of artistic expression and technological innovation. The study explores the transition from traditional theremins, commonly recreated in music programming classes, to the visually engaging Bare\"emin family. In this evolution, the conventional antennae are replaced by creatively envisioned antennae, becoming a defining feature across varied shapes and sizes, categorized into handheld, environmental, and painted score species. Rooted in the artist's synesthetic perception, where sight and sound converge, Bare\"emins embody diegetic shapes and colors. The antennae, made from conductive paint, copper tape, or found materials, showcase a commitment to sustainability and inclusivity. The paper provides instructions for crafting Bare\"emins using readily available materials, fostering an environmentally conscious approach. By enhancing the artistic appeal and making the construction accessible, Bare\"emins bridge the gap between visual artistry and musicality, offering a unique and inclusive avenue for exploring the intersection of art and technology in the realm of musical instrument design.}

Such systems do not take advantage of higher level semantically meaningful brain data which could be used in adaptive systems or without detracting from the attention of the user. We present a new type of real-time BCI that assists users in musical improvisation by adapting to users' measured cognitive workload implicitly. Our system advances the state of the art in this area in three ways: 1) We demonstrate that cognitive workload can be classified in real-time while users play the piano using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. 2) We build a real-time, implicit system using this brain signal that musically adapts to what users are playing. 3) We demonstrate that users prefer this novel musical instrument over other conditions and report that they feel more creative.}

AVIEM primarily consists of separate audio and visual libraries and grows with user contribution as users explore different combinations between them. The library provides a wide range of experimentation possibilities by allowing users to create audiovisual relations and logging their emotional responses through its interface. Besides being a resourceful tool of experimentation, AVIEM aims to become a source of inspiration, where digitally created abstract virtual environments and soundscapes can elicit target emotions at a preconscious level, by building genuine audiovisual relations that would engage the viewer on a strong emotional stage. Lastly, various schemes are proposed to visualize information extracted through AVIEM, to improve the navigation and designate the trends and dependencies among audiovisual relations.},

Participants can easily create simple sound compositions in real time by collaboratively operating physical artifacts as sound controllers. The physical configuration of the artifacts requires coordinated actions between participants to control sound (thus requiring, and emphasizing collaboration). Simpletones encourages playful human-to-human interaction by introducing a simple interface and a set of basic rules [1]. This enables novices to focus on the collaborative aspects of making music as a group (such as synchronization and taking collective decisions through non-verbal communication) to ultimately engage a state of group flow[2]. This project is relevant to a contemporary discourse on musical expression because it allows novices to experience the social aspects of group music making, something that is usually reserved only for trained performers [3].},

We present PiaF (Piano Follower), a prototype for augmenting piano performance by measuring gesture variations. We survey other augmented piano projects, several of which focus on gestural recognition, and present our prototype which uses machine learning techniques for gesture classification and estimation of gesture variations in real-time. Our implementation uses the Kinect depth sensor to track body motion in space, which is used as input data. During an initial learning phase, the system is taught a set of reference gestures, or templates. During performance, the live gesture is classified in real-time, and variations with respect to the recognized template are computed. These values can then be mapped to audio processing parameters, to control digital effects which are applied to the acoustic output of the piano in real-time. We discuss initial tests using PiaF with a pianist, as well as potential applications beyond live performance, including pedagogy and embodiment of recorded performance.}

We worked on the development of algorithms for drawing figures and synthesizing images and sound on all three platforms and experimented with various mechanisms for coordinating synthesis and rendering in different media. Several problems were addressed: How to coordinate the timing between different platforms? What configuration to use? Clientserver (who is the client who the server?), equal partners, mixed configurations. A library was developed in SuperCollider to enable the packaging of algorithms into modules with automatic generation of GUI from specifications, and the saving of configurations of modules into session files as scripts in SuperCollider code. The application of this library as a framework for both driving graphic synthesis in Processing and receiving control data from it resulted in an environment for experimentation that is also being used successfully in teaching interactive audiovisual media.},

Each cube was identical in construction, but half the instruments were configured for two degrees of freedom while the other half allowed only a single degree. Each musician practiced at home and presented two performances, in which their techniques and reactions were assessed through video, sensor data logs, questionnaires and interviews. Results show that the addition of a second degree of freedom had the counterintuitive effect of reducing the exploration of the instrument's affordances; this suggested the presence of a dominant constraint in one of the two configurations which strongly differentiated the process of appropriation across the two groups of participants.}

Some of the most precise physical simulations of sound propagation are based on Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) methods, which are stable, highly parameterizable but characterized by an extremely heavy computational load. This drawback hinders the spread of FDTD from the domain of off-line simulations to the one of DMIs. With this paper, we present a novel approach to real-time physical modelling synthesis, which implements a 2D FDTD solver as a shader program running on the GPU directly within the graphics pipeline. The result is a system capable of running fully interactive, massively sized simulation domains, suitable for novel DMI design. With the help of diagrams and code snippets, we provide the implementation details of a first interactive application, a drum head simulator whose source code is available online. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system, showing how this new approach can work as a valuable alternative to classic GPGPU modelling.}

The ability for replication contributes to an instrument's longevity and creates opportunities for both DMI designers and researchers. Research papers often omit necessary knowledge for replicating research artefacts, but we argue that mitigating this situation is not just about including design materials and documentation. Our way of approaching this issue is by drawing on an age-old method as a way of disseminating knowledge, the apprenticeship. We propose the DMI apprenticeship as a way of exploring the procedural obstacles of replicating DMIs, while highlighting for both apprentice and designer the elements of knowledge that are a challenge to communicate in conventional documentation. Our own engagement with the DMI apprenticeship led to successfully replicating an instrument, Strummi. Framing this process as an apprenticeship highlighted the non-obvious areas of the documentation and manufacturing process that are crucial in the successful replication of a DMI.}

In this paper, we introduce a case study of the design of a string-less guitar, which was developed in collaboration with a guitarist who lost his ability to play due to impairment. We present this work as an exploration of the Rashomon effect, a term that refers to the phenomenon of multiple witnesses describing the same event from their own perspective.

We define this system as an embodied interface for expressive musical performance, characterized by the relationships between the performer, the virtual, and the physical environment. After a review of existing literature concerning the evaluation of immersive musical instruments and the affordances of MR systems, we offer a new framework based on three dimensions to support the design and analysis of MRMIs. We illustrate its use with application to existing works.}

We have recently seen various improvements of interface design on tactile feedback and force guidance aiming to make instrument learning more effective. However, most interfaces are still quite static; they cannot yet sense the learning progress and adjust the tutoring strategy accordingly. To solve this problem, we contribute an adaptive haptic interface based on the latest design of haptic flute. We first adopted a clutch mechanism to enable the interface to turn on and off the haptic control flexibly in real time. The interactive tutor is then able to follow human performances and apply the ``teacher force'' only when the software instructs so. Finally, we incorporated the adaptive interface with a step-by-step dynamic learning strategy. Experimental results showed that dynamic learning dramatically outperforms static learning, which boosts the learning rate by 45.3\% and shrinks the forgetting chance by 86\%.}

This paper explores the role that deformable interfaces might play in DMI design. We conducted an online study with 23 DMI designers in which they were invited to create non-functional deformable DMIs together. Our results suggest forms of gestural input and sound mappings that deformable interfaces intuitively lend themselves to for DMI design. From our results, we highlight four styles of DMI that deformable interfaces might be most suited to, and suggest the kinds of experience that deformable DMIs might be most compelling for musicians and audiences. We discuss how DMI designers explore deformable materials and gestures input and the role of unexpected affordances in the design process.}

The size of traditional large-scale DMIs limits the ability of performers to interact with the instrument, causing discomfort when engaging with distant components, highlighting the need for more flexible and user-friendly large-scale DMI designs. We present an Augmented Reality (AR) DMI that removes physical constraints by allowing performers to customise the size and layout of the instrument according to their performance environment. We aim to show how AR-based configuration supports immersive performance, promotes expressive gestures, and improves spatial awareness without sacrificing large-scale instrument capabilities. Our user study revealed increased physical engagement and spatial immersion, a strong sense of ownership, and a positive user experience. These findings indicate that our AR DMI is creatively empowering, reasonably addressing the constraints of large-scale instruments. Our research emphasises the potential of AR to enable flexible and customisable DMI design where interfaces can be adapted to suit the needs of individual performers.}

  abstract = {ChuGL (sounds like "chuckle"; rhymes with "juggle") is a unified audiovisual programming framework built into the ChucK language. It extends ChucK's strongly-timed, concurrent programming model with a 3D rendering engine and a new paradigm for coding real-time graphics and audio. ChuGL introduces the notion of a Graphics Generator (GGen) that can be manipulated sample-synchronously alongside audio unit generators (UGens) to unify graphics and audio within a single strongly-timed language. Under the hood, this is made possible by a multithreaded scenegraph architecture that provides low-latency, high performance audiovisual synchronization. In this paper we present the design ethos of ChuGL, describe its integrated graphics-and-audio workflow, highlight architectural decisions, and present an evaluation of ChuGL as a tool for expressive audiovisual design, used in a computer music programming course at Stanford University. ChuGL transforms ChucK into a standalone audiovisual programming language, and argues for a way of thinking and doing in which audio and graphics are given equal importance.}

  abstract = {Since its inception in early 2000s, the ChucK music programming language has undergone many expansions and changes. In the early years, there was a flurry of contributions that are still in use today. During the 2010s, there was a notable decrease in ChucK development (despite a few dedicated individuals who kept the language on life support). Recently, however, ChucK development has experienced something of a resurrection. This paper highlights the major initiatives since 2018, including new core language features, ChuGL (graphics), ChAI (AI), Chunity (ChucK in Unity), Chunreal (ChucK in Unreal Engine), WebChucK (ChucK in browsers), and further extensions to the language through Chugins (ChucK plugins). Furthermore, we will highlight future directions of ChucK development.}
