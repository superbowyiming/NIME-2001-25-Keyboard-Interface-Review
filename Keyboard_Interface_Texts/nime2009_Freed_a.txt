Abstract 
A compendium of foundational circuits for interfacing 
resistive pressure and position sensors is presented with 
example applications for music controllers and tangible 
interfaces. 
Keywords: Piezoresistive Touch Sensor Pr essure Sensing 
Current Steering Multitouch.  
1. Introduction 
The recent surge in development of multitouch gesture 
systems is mainly around capacitive [28] and optical [5] 
sensing techniques.  Although interesting and widely used 
by the NIME community, most musical applications of 
touch benefit g reatly from concurrent acquisition of 
pressure or force at the touch points [1]. For this 
piezoresistive materials have proven  most effective.  
At least three  generations of inventors have developed 
sensing circuitry for resistive arrays and piezoresistive 
materials with much duplication of effort along the way. 
This paper describes the key (and largely forgotten) 
methods and introduces new higher -performance c ircuits 
developed for musical instrument controllers.  
2. The Current-flow viewpoint 
Much recent electronics teaching in the NIME and 
tangible, physical computing communities starts with a 
voltage-centric view of resistive sensing with the potential 
divider o n center stage. Even the wikipedia erroneously 
defines the potentiometer as an adjustable voltage divider 
[29]. This voltage -centric view is reinforced by energy 
efficient designs and also because ubiquitous, cheap a/d 
converters measure voltages not currents. Most of the 
circuits presented here exploit control of current flows in 
resistive networks so the reader is encouraged to review 
both Kirchoff's voltage and current circuit laws and Ohms 
law before proceeding.  
3. Grounded wiper 
Figure 1 shows an alternative to the well -known potential 
divider circuit often used with potentiometers. Instead of 
using the wiper to pick off a fraction of a constant voltage 
applied across the terminals, the wiper is grounded and 
two independ ent voltages are acquired at the terminals. 
This circuit offers no particular advantage over the 
potential divider in conventional mechanical 
potentiometers and sliders but has two advantages for 
resistive strip devices like the Softpot [23] or SlideLong  
[24]: providing some shielding and drawing no power 
when the wiper is physically disengaged from the resistive 
material, i.e. when there is no physical touch of the strip.  
 
Figure 1. Potential divider (left), and Grounded wiper (right)  
3.1 Duo Touch 
Softpots and related devices differ from conventional 
potentiometers in that their “wipers” are continuous 
conductors suspended over  contact points along the full 
length of the resistive material or for the SlideLong over 
conductors that tap into the resistive material. There is no 
standard schematic symbols for this so in Figure 2 we 
introduce the indented bar symbol to represent pote ntially 
multiple touch points. This schematic makes clearer the 
main benefit of sensing at the terminals: two touch 
positions can be sensed concurrently.  
Figure 2 represents a flexible design pattern that can be 
applied to many position sensing application s so we will 
analyze it in more detail.

Figure 2 Sensing 2 points with Membrane potentiometers  
The first case is easy to understand:  If no touch is 
occuring there is no path for current to ground so both 
measurement nodes must be at the high potential. W hen 
the membrane contacts the resistive strip all we need 
consider is the outermost pair of points of contact. There 
can be no potential difference between these points as they 
are both shorted together and connected to ground. The 
resistive material betwe en the outer touch points is shorted 
out of the circuit. We can estimate the position of these 
outer points by applying the standard potential divider 
formula to the resistances to the left and right of the 
contact points and their respective pull -up resistors. 
The history of duo -touch goes back at least to early 
music keyboard switch patents with shorted capacitor and 
resistor networks [8] and shorted inductors [26]. Figure 3 
shows h ow ARP used a constant current source for a 
duophonic keyboard in the ARP 2500 and the 3620 
keyboard for the ARP 2600 [22]. The ARP circuit 
topology was also used on the TVS-1A by Oberheim in 
1975 using a single transistor for the current source [11].  
 
Figure 3 1974 ARP dua l keyboard circuit  
A more modern implementation of the same idea is 
available from PIAI [18] for a dual touch ribbon control ler. 
These analog-output solutions do provide a linear, 
position-to-voltage output relationship obviating the 
voltage divider computation of equation 1. They are 
however more expensive in parts and space than one using 
the pull -up resistors in Figure 2 wit h a modern 
microcontroller with integrated A/D converter(s). A useful 
hybrid of the benefits of both implementations is to replace 
the pull up resistors of Figure 2 by integrated constant 
current sources such as those integrated on the TI REF200.  
The Moog Modular Synthesizer duophonic keyboard 
module 952 [10] puts the resistor ladder around the 
feedback loop of an inverting opamp – another well -
known constant -current technique we will see later in 
section 4. 
 The circuit of Figure 2 app ears in a 1994 digital 
reimplementation [19, 21]  of the Trautonium [25]. 
Trautonium sensors differ from the membrane 
potentiometers discussed earlier in that the resistive 
material (a helical wire) is pressed against the conductive 
wiper. In the “digital” trautonium analog voltages at both 
ends of the wire were made available to the A/D 
converters but only one was used in the musi c synthesis 
mappings [20]. 
 The duotouch technique was revived more recently by 
the author for controllers in an interactive installation [3]. 
For a two -foot position sensor a resistor chain was wired 
between the switches of a burglar alarm floor -sensing 
array.  A two -finger input pad was also presented 
combining two Infusion S ystems SlideWide devices 
stacked orthogonally to each other yielding independent x 
and y position estimates.  
 
Figure 4: DuoTouch sensing pad  
Independently, this technique was rediscovered for 4 -
wire resistive touch screens [9].  
3.2 DuoTouch and Pressure  
In the duotouch tablet of Figure 4 an independent layer of 
piezoresistive fabric sandwiched between two conductors 
provides a single composite pressure value. This layered 
approach proved too unwieldy for the sensing strips in a 
new stringless cello controller (Figure 5) [4]. 
Instead a novel circuit was develo ped to allow for dual 
position sensing and aggregate pressure using a modified 
Interlink FSR strip [7]. 
231
  
Figure 5: Stringless Cello Position and Pre ssure Strips 
These strips were originally intended for pressure -only 
sensing. The basic FSR is a two lead device corresponding 
to each side of an interdigitated array of silver conductors 
printed on a plastic strip. In the novel duotouch strip  extra 
sensing nodes are added by connecting wires to conductive 
adhesive fabric strips taped at each end of the 
piezoresistive material.  These are the nodes that are 
connected to pull -up resistors and to the data -acquisition 
channels for position estimation (from th e “nut” and 
“bridge in the stringless cello) as shown in Figure 6.  
 
 
Figure 6. Dual Position and Pressure Circuit  
 
 When position data is being acquired the 
microcontroller maintains both silver pressure conductors 
at ground potential resulting in a circu it equivalent to 
Figure 2. When pressure is to be acquired, current is sent 
down one of the silver conductors  (via pull up -resistor Rp) 
and the voltage at that node is measured. The endpoint 
pull-up resistors are switched out of the circuit during this 
measurement. The key to efficiently doing this on the large 
scale of the stringless cello (12 strips) is the flexible and 
dynamic assignment of roles to pins now possible on 
modern microcontrollers. This allows for other dynamic 
current steering techniques s uch as Charlieplexing [13], 
and bidirectional LEDS [15]. These techniques have been 
generalized in uOSC and are easily accessible by carefully 
constructing OSC messages sent to the microcontroller 
[16]. 
Note that these current mode sensing techniques  are 
energy efficient because the pull -up voltage source may be 
enabled briefly in each data -acquisition cycle – for just 
long enough for stray capacitances to settle and for the few 
microseconds needed for the ADC's sample and hold phase 
to complete. 
4. Polytouch 
David Wessel's polytouch “slab” [27] consists of a 4x8 
array of piezoresistive touch pads from Interlink (Figure 7) 
with two axes of position sensing (X/Y) and pressure (Z).  
 
Figure 7. Slab 
A novel custom circuit (Figure 8) was developed to 
meet the challenging requirements  of the performer: high -
speed data acquisition rate (<1mS) and concurrent 
acquisition of the measurands for all 32 pads.  
Figure 8 Concurrent Sensing for the Slab  
232
Only 4 conductors are accessible from these resistive 
trackpads. This makes it challenging t o isolate the 
pressure-sensing axis. Sandbach patented the same 
constant-current source/difference amplifier approach [14] 
we saw in the ARP dual keyb oard approach for their fabric 
implementation of the same kind of touchpad. Interlink 
themselves uses a microcontroller to measure charge rates 
of capacitors driven via the resistive array [6] as shown in 
Figure 9. 
 
Figure 9 Interlink Versapad Scanning  
The solution developed by the author is to provide a 
small constant current through the touch pad array 
inverting op-amplifier shown in Figure 8. This is similar to 
the approach Moog employed on his 926 duo key board. 
The inverting input is a virtual ground at the same 
potential as the non -inverting input. The current through 
the pad resistors is established by two constants in the 
circuit, the summing node input resistor R and the source 
voltage reference applie d to one leg of this resistor.   The 
three measurands (XYZ) are computed by subtraction of 
the three op -amp outputs. The op -amps should be selected 
to have low input offset voltage. External noise sources are 
controlled by limiting the op -amp bandwidth wit h a low 
value capacitor from its output to the summing node (C). 
This circuit has a lower parts count than Sandbach’s and 
has the advantage over Interlink’s solution of forming the 
outputs concurrently. 
5. Resistive Manytouch with Pressure 
The author’s “tablo ” controller integrates sensing of 
displacement and “aftertouch” pressure using resistive 
sensing of conductive fabric drape position and 
piezoresistive fabric sensing of pressure. A silver -plated 
flexible fabric is held in a circular embroidery hoop. When  
the hoop is attached to the base of the Tablo, the highly 
conductive fabric is grounded by a ring of conductive 
copper fabric at the top of the trapped inverted cereal bowl. 
Strips of resistive carbon -loaded plastic form a ring of 
potential dividers compl eted by pullup resistors under the 
bowl. The drape of the fabric is estimated from the voltage 
at these divider nodes as it varies according to how much 
of the plastic strips is shorted to ground. If the performer 
presses the flexible fabric to contact one  of the two 
piezoresistive, divided annular rings on the base it grounds 
the leg of  another potential divider for pressure sensing.  
Although already described briefly at Nime in 2008 [2] 
it is included here because current -steering techniques are  
used in an unusual context: a single gesture results in the 
grounding of multiple independent circuits with nodes at 
different parts of the fabric. This provides for a higher 
gesture sampling rate and accurate, concurrent support of 
large and small distan ce gestures – both unobtainable in 
current camera-based drape sensing systems [12].

6. Resistive Multitouch with Pressure 
The main challenge with resistive multitouch arrays is 
achieving sufficient spatial resolution. Even modest 
sensing areas require thousands of taxels for seamless 
233
position and pressure sensing. Multiplexing addresses th is 
problem requiring only n+m edge connections for an n by 
m sensing array. The well -established approach to avoid 
crosstalk along the orthogonal wiring array is to place a 
series diode at every node.  
  
Figure 11 Diode isolated variable resistor array.  
 
 Figure 12 Grounding and virtual ground sensor isolation  
The number and nature of the diodes in Figure 11 may 
be prohibitive in many applications. For example in 
piezoresistive fabric array sensing  [2] flexible diodes may 
be difficult to create. Independence of sensed values in a 
pure resistive array is done by grounding all the rows that 
are not being addressed and using virtual grounds for the 
input sensing. In this case it can be verified  that the voltage 
across all the resistors that are not being sensed is 0 so no 
current flows are possible to interfere with the measurands. 
Figure 12 shows how this is done with multiplexing of 
both row and column signals. Acquisition speed and 
sensing performance can be improved by omitting the row 
multiplexer and providing an inverting -opamp and A/D 
converter channel for each row  [17]. 
7. Conclusion 
Although, certai nly not the final word on resistive sensing 
circuits, the combination of older designs from the 1970’s 
and 1980’s and newer implementation strategies described 
here provide a solid baseline for future tangible interface 
developments.  These circuits are no t the most glamorous 
part of development of new instruments for musical 
expression but they have been the enabling innovation for 
instruments now used regularly in live performance,  e.g.,  
[27] [4].

a high potential in turn and measuring the currents at X i -
typically with an inverting op-amp and A/D converter. By 
carefully considering the possible current sources for each
