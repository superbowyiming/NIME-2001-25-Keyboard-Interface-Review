ABSTRACT
Laptop orchestras create music, although digitally produced,
in a collaborative live performance not unlike a traditional
orchestra. The recent increase in interest and investment
in this style of music creation has paved the way for novel
methods for musicians to create and interact with music. To
this end, a number of nontraditional instruments have been
constructed that enable musicians to control sound produc-
tion beyond pitch and volume, integrating ﬁltering, musical
eﬀects, etc. Wii Remotes (WiiMotes) have seen heavy use
in maker communities, including laptop orchestras, for their
robust sensor array and low cost. The placement of sensors
and the form factor of the device itself are suited for video
games, not necessarily live music creation. In this paper,
the authors present a new controller design, based on the
WiiMote hardware platform, to address usability in gesture-
centric music performance. Based on the pilot-study data,
the new controller oﬀers unrestricted two-hand gesture pro-
duction, smaller footprint, and lower muscle strain.

1. INTRODUCTION
Laptop orchestras, a juxtaposition of a highly mobile, mod-
ern technology and a largely immobile, traditional music
ensemble, allow musicians to interact with their craft in
new ways [1]. Originally introduced at Princeton with the
Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk) [2], the new perfor-
mance ensemble saw rapid expansion to other universities [3,
4, 5]. A laptop orchestra is more loosely deﬁned in terms of
its instruments and organizational structure, as compared
to a traditional one. A laptop is the centerpiece for each
performer, but the way they interact with it and how music
ﬂows from the digital environment to the audience varies
widely from group to group and even between music pieces.
The typical performer’s station features an interface device
that feeds input to the laptop. The laptop then generates

sound based on user input parameters and emits it through
a dedicated omni-directional speaker. The input interface
device can provide abstract controller data or an audio feed
(e.g., voice) that is then used to generate and/or manipulate
the ensuing audio output. A similar eﬀect of the traditional
orchestra is created through the individual speakers; each
musician creates their own localized sound, and the sum
total of these sounds becomes the full experience for the
audience.
This type of collaborative, live music creation builds itself
on the versatility and modularity of the laptop architecture.
The environment surrounding a laptop orchestra resonates
well with maker-culture [6]. That is to say, many diﬀerent
disciplines are required to make use of a laptop orchestra,
including engaging students with no musical background to
develop new sensors, software setups, and the instruments
themselves [2]. One of the most exciting aspects of a lap-
top orchestra is the freedom that composers and musicians
have in terms of interaction and digital signal processing.
Rather than constraining themselves to the capabilities and
instruments of a traditional orchestra, composers can now
create new instruments, sounds, and input methods speciﬁc
to their composition.
Early laptop orchestras used the laptop in a more con-
ventional way, sitting with hands on the keyboard using
keys mapped to diﬀerent functionalities [7]. Quickly though,
such economical and contained input methods evolved to in-
clude other, arguably more visually engaging, ways of cre-
ating music, including gaming controllers. Since its incep-
tion in 2009, the Linux Laptop Orchestra (L2Ork) relied
almost exclusively on WiiMotes and gesture-based perfor-
mance rooted in Taiji choreography [8], as one of the earliest
examples of systematic exploration of choreography-centric
performance practice. Other examples include the Machine
Orchestra that makes use of ﬁve diﬀerent musical robots in
coordination with ten human-operated laptop stations [9],
PLOrk’s repurposing of a golf game controller [10], and most
recently JoyStyx, a MIDI controller that acts as a granular
synthesizer [11], where the user interacts with a music sam-
ple through ﬁve joysticks positioned underneath each of the
user’s ﬁngertips.
Hyperinstruments, instruments that both produce and
modulate sound [12], have strong alignment with the goals
of a laptop orchestra. They enable performers to interact
with their music in diﬀerent ways. Some hyperinstruments
modify, enhance, or augment existing instruments. For
instance the HyperPuja, an instrumented Tibetan singing
bowl, maintains the look and feel of the traditional instru-
ment, but sound is generated through integrated sensors in
the bowl [13]. The hyper-ﬂute is an augmented and instru-
mented ﬂute that plays like one, but enables the performer
to modify the sound they create through additional inter-
faces installed on its body [14]. Similarly, the Hyper-shaku
275
augments a Japanese bamboo sahkuhachi with gesture con-
trol capabilities, giving the performer access to both au-
dio and visual controls [15]. El-Lamellophone provides ges-
ture control capabilities through integrated sensors that en-
able control over the produced sound [16]. There are also
options for hyperinstruments, such as the Cam´ era Musi-
cale and Phalanger, that are driven through pure motion
capture [17, 18]. This type of functionality has also been
brought to percussive instruments, allowing gesture control
based on mallet positioning [19].
Recent developments in wearable hyperinstruments open
up new possibilities for performer-music interaction. Some
initial eﬀorts investigated interpreting 3-axis accelerometer
data to extrapolate hand gestures [20]. Wearable hyperin-
struments rapidly evolved to more robust sensor arrays such
as Kontrol [21], which features individual accelerometers for
each ﬁnger as well as one for the palm. Others, such as
FutureGrab, take on a more glove-like aesthetic while also
providing the performer with tactile interaction options [22].
The Hand-Controller provides similar functionality with an
emphasis on tactile feedback, including a set of sliders un-
derneath the user’s ﬁngers [23]. This functionality has been
developed to the point of commercialization. For example,
the MiMu glove captures hand gestures and oﬀers tactile
interaction options for music modiﬁcation [24, 25, 26]. A
corresponding toolbox was released to enable similar ges-
ture control capabilities on other platforms [27].
Though many wearable hyperinstruments have been de-
veloped, the authors attempt to address two key areas: sen-
sor robustness and cost point. Many of these wearables are
built from the ground up, and therefore do not have a large
background in signal processing robustness to ensure clean
and clear input-output relationships. Systems built with
this in mind, such as the MiMu glove, have a prohibitive cost
point for many organizations, such as a laptop orchestra. To
that end, this paper discusses the development of a wear-
able hyperinstrument built on the Nintendo WiiMote. This
commercially available device has a low cost point along
with the backing of robust signal processing, and a readily
available reverse-engineered communication protocol.
2. PROBLEM FORMULATION
The Nintendo Wii console has seen international success,
selling over 100 million units worldwide [28]. Its controller,
the WiiMote, received strong reception from the maker com-
munity for the capabilities of its built-in sensor array paired
with a low cost of $40 [29]. This combination has seen the
WiiMote put to a variety of use cases outside of its original
intent as a video game controller. In fact, the WiiMote has
been used successfully as a music controller [5, 30, 31]. User
feedback from these studies found that the controller was
able to accurately respond to user inputs considering both
the motion control capabilities and the haptic feedback of
button presses.
In the instance of L2Ork, the performers rely almost ex-
clusively on the WiiMote with MotionPlus and Nunchuk
attachments. Although the stock controller oﬀers a rich
array of instrumentation, including analog and digital in-
puts, their location and distribution is less than ideal. For
instance, access to some of the buttons on the WiiMote re-
quires unusual hand positioning or an entirely diﬀerent way
of holding the controller. In addition, the WiiMote and
Nunchuk require a constant grip that over time can generate
signiﬁcant strain. This is particularly problematic when the
ensemble is utilizing the free-ﬂowing and relaxed motions of
Taiji. The MotionPlus is placed at the bottom of the Wii-
Mote, where its ability to capture the full breadth of hand
motion is less than optimal. Lastly, the wired connection
between the WiiMote and the Nunchuk signiﬁcantly limit
the independence of the two hands and arms. While there
are third party wireless Nunchuks, the eﬀorts to reverse en-
gineer their protocol, due to system complexity, have not
been successful. As such, they remain unsuitable for use in
NIME scenarios.
It appears that a more suitable controller is needed to re-
alize the full potential of gesture-centric performance. Glove-
like solutions, like those presented in Section 1, address most
if not all of the aforesaid limitations of a WiiMote, but their
cost remains prohibitively high. In fact, some exceed the en-
tire cost of multiple L2Ork stations. More so, given L2Ork’s
focus on K-12 (kindergarten through 12th grade) education,
such solutions are unlikely candidates for K-12 scenarios.
It appears there is an unrealized opportunity to use Wii-
Mote hardware as the foundation for building an alterna-
tive controller that can address the identiﬁed limitations at
a reasonable cost, considering the diverse array of sensors
and inputs, plus the unmatched low cost of the WiiMote
controller. More so, recognizing that historic improvements
in instrument design were more iterative than revolution-
ary (i.e., perfecting an already strong design), the authors
decided to seek a way to make an iterative improvement
on an already compelling hardware platform. Alternative
platforms exist, such as the Adafruit Feather M0 BLE [32].
3. IMPLEMENTATION
The main goals of the L2OrkMote, an alternative WiiMote
hardware-based controller, are to:
1. Enable the unrestricted freedom of two hands/arms;
2. Minimize hand and arm strain by limiting the need for
a constant grip while ensuring that the key analog and
digital controls remain easily and quickly accessible;
3. Minimize potential discomfort due to potentially awk-
ward and/or contextual button placement;
4. Optimize sensor location to improve the capturing of
hand and arm motion, and choreography;
5. Keep the visual footprint at a minimum;
6. Maintain low cost overhead.
To meet these goals, the single WiiMote, MotionPlus,
and Nunchuk system was replaced with two, one for each
hand. This design choice immediately alleviated the ﬁrst
goal. While eﬀectively doubling the price of the necessary
hardware, its overall cost remains well below glove-like so-
lutions. The ensuing L2OrkMote builds on L2Ork’s previ-
ous reverse-engineering eﬀorts and utilizes redesigned 3D-
printed enclosures. Lastly, it makes several notable modiﬁ-
cations to the WiiMote circuit board and its accessories.
3.1 Wearable Design
In order to accommodate a WiiMote, Nunchuk, and Mo-
tionPlus to a single hand while allowing for the controller
to remain in hand without requiring a constant grip, both
the WiiMote and Nunchuk had to be usable in hands-free
scenarios. With few modiﬁcations, the WiiMote can be eas-
ily and comfortably strapped to the performer’s forearm. Its
newfound placement limits access to digital controls (e.g.,
buttons), requiring transplanting some of the key controls
away from the WiiMote’s main circuit board. In turn, this
arrangement oﬀers opportunities for minimizing the Wii-
Mote’s form factor, making it easier to cover with a sleeve
or similar garment (Figure 1). The WiiMote’s original cas-
ing featured additional material and space to improve the
user’s ability to grip the device. Strapping the device to the
performer’s forearm does not impose those same considera-
tions.
276
Figure 1: The L2OrkMote Prototype Design
The L2OrkMote casing was therefore designed to form-
ﬁt around the main circuit board. Transplanting sensors
away from the main board (discussed in Section 3.2) also
served to minimize this form factor, resulting in the design
shown in Figure 1. The main board is largely sealed away
from the performer, as they need very limited access to the
instrumentation on the board. The synchronization button
is exposed, but recessed, in order to allow the performer to
swap controllers and connect as necessary.
While the WiiMote’s wearability on the forearm posed
few challenges, redesigning the Nunchuk device required a
number of considerations. Firstly, it had to be hands-free to
enable the performer to release their grip while still allowing
them to reliably interface with the joystick and buttons at
a moment’s notice. Secondly, as the joystick and buttons
are manipulated, the device had to stay ﬁrmly in the per-
former’s palm without requiring them to hold onto it during
interaction. The brace extending from the casing, shown in
Figure 2, was included for this purpose. It stabilizes the
device against the performer’s palm, holding it in a consis-
tent position. Thirdly, to improve the performer’s comfort,
soft padding was added to the interior of the brace. Finally,
the device is further restrained with a set of straps, which
ﬁrmly hold the device in the performer’s palm regardless of
hand orientation and without their direct interaction.

3.2 Features
The detailed design of the L2OrkMote Nunchuk was con-
strained by the location of its sensors. These were modiﬁed
from the stock Nunchuk based on required accessibility dur-
ing performances. The stock sensor placement is as follows:
WiiMote: Accelerometer, buttons (A, B, 1, 2, Minus,
Home, Plus, Power, Sync, and the 4-button D-Pad), vibra-
tion motor, speaker, IR camera, bluetooth, and batteries.
Nunchuk: Two buttons (C and Z) and joystick.
Wii MotionPlus: Gyroscope.
The performers made extensive use of the gyroscope, but-
tons, and joystick during performances. As such, those in-
terfaces were moved into the redesigned Nunchuk for easier
access. The sync button was left in the WiiMote and made
accessible through a small indentation. The remaining sen-
sors and components were left in the redesigned WiiMote
enclosure, rendering the unused buttons (i.e., 1, 2, Minus,
Plus, Home, Power, and the D-Pad) eﬀectively inaccessible.
In addition, due to the WiiMote’s positioning, the IR cam-
era was also left unusable. The loss of buttons was deemed
acceptable, because the original form factor made access to
1, 2, and to a lesser extent Minus, Home, and Plus cumber-
some. The power button was unusable as it would interrupt
connectivity, while the D-Pad was observed to cause discom-
fort over extended use due to sharp edges. Furthermore,
the button loss was further oﬀset by the use of a second
Nunchuk-like device with an analog joystick and four but-
tons, including the A and B that were transplanted from the
WiiMote. Moving the A and B buttons and integrating the
MotionPlus gyroscope into the redesigned Nunchuk simply
required extending the associated wiring.
The Nunchuk’s redesigned enclosure (Figure 2), inspired
by the original Nunchuk, was constrained by a circuitry
form factor dominated by the thumb-centric joystick place-
ment. The joystick and original two buttons sit in rela-
tively similar orientations, falling at natural positions for
the thumb, index, and middle ﬁngers. The A and B but-
tons were brought from the WiiMote, and moved into the
redesigned Nunchuk at natural positions for the ring and
little ﬁngers. Finally, the MotionPlus gyroscope was moved
directly underneath the joystick. Considering the Motion-
Plus add-on resides on a separate circuit board, its reposi-
tioning was relatively straightforward. A curved top surface
snap ﬁts over the assembly to contain the instrumentation.
The WiiMote redesign considerations were dominated by
the need for a comfortable, inconspicuous device. The cas-
ings for the WiiMote, MotionPlus, and Nunchuk circuit
boards and internal instrumentation were designed to be
as form-ﬁt as possible.
3.3 Prototype Fabrication
The L2OrkMote prototype was fabricated via the mate-
rial extrusion additive manufacturing process, providing the
ability to rapidly iterate and improve in the spirit of the
open source, collaborative nature of laptop orchestras [6].
The intention is to tune the L2OrkMote to an individual
orchestra’s needs and later, possibly down to the individual
user, rather than mass-produce it. Mass customization such
as this is perfectly suited for additive manufacturing [33].
Considering the L2Ork ensemble’s infrastructure leverages
open-source solutions wherever possible, in part because of
its ongoing K-12 outreach mission, the L2OrkMote enclo-
sure design will be made publicly available with the neces-
sary supporting documentation. The complete, assembled
L2OrkMote prototype can be seen in Figure 3.

4. ASSESSMENT
We conducted a pilot study to test the usability of the
L2OrkMote prototype controller. A total of 10 Virginia
Tech students participated in the study, of which 5 were
female, 5 were male, and 4 had prior knowledge in using
the WiiMote controllers. The participants used both the
L2OrkMote and WiiMote controller systems with a sim-
ple music instrument designed using the Pd-L2Ork [34, 35].
The only diﬀerence between the two instruments was that
277
the extended capability of the L2OrkMote setup allowed
for concurrent control of two independent voices, whereas
the WiiMote setup only allowed for one. We surveyed the
conﬁdence of participants in pressing the 4 buttons of the
L2OrkMote prototype individually, and in 3 diﬀerent com-
binations. They were also surveyed for their comfort, pref-
erence, and ease of use while utilizing each controller setup.
Lastly, we surveyed their preference for the L2OrkMote over
the WiiMote setup, and vice-versa. All scales were bivariate
with minimum and maximum values of 1 and 5 respectively.
Ordinary least-squares (OLS) analyses of variance (with
type I error of .1) for all surveyed variables in Table 1
yielded no statistical signiﬁcance between the participants
with and without prior knowledge in using the WiiMote
for musical expression. Table 1 shows descriptive statis-
tics and describes an expanded OLS regression estimating
the unique contribution of 7 surveyed variables as predictors
for the dependent variable (DV),controller setup preference,
which yielded an excellent internal reliability of .92. The re-
gression model 3 oﬀers the higher adjusted R2, thus being
deemed the best ﬁt. After testing both controller setups, the
participants had the chance to write their thoughts about
the study. Coding their expressed thoughts for concerns,
suggestions, and comments is shown in Table 2.

An assessment of the design goals for the L2OrkMote pro-
totype was based on the reported quantitative and qualita-
tive analyses. The goal for enabling unrestricted freedom
of two hands/arms was supported by the qualitative anal-
ysis. Half of the participants noted that their freedom in
moving their hands was a factor in their preference of the
L2OrkMote over the WiiMote setup.
The goal to minimize hand and arm strain by eliminating
the need for a constant grip on the controllers was supported
by the quantitative analysis. The predictor of relaxation
during the use of the L2OrkMote, while ensuring that the
key analog and digital controls remain easily and quickly
accessible, was the most inﬂuential in the OLS regression.
The goal to minimize potential discomfort due to awk-
ward and/or contextual button placement was not supported
by the qualitative analysis as 4 participants speciﬁcally ex-
pressed their concern about the placement and functionality
of the 4 buttons on the L2OrkMote prototype. The quanti-
tative analysis also showed that the comfort in pressing the
buttons of the L2OrkMote was the least inﬂuential predic-
tor, thus it was dropped from the regression model.
The goal to optimize sensor location to improve the cap-
turing of hand and arm motion, and choreography was a
controversial matter among the study participants.
The goal to keep the visual footprint at a minimum was
not supported by the qualitative analysis, because 4 partic-
ipants expressed concerns about the size of the part that
mounts on the palm, the way, and the weight of the part
that mounts on the forearm.
The use of only a 3D-printed case, a battery pack, and
minimum cabling to wire the parts of the L2OrkMote pro-
totype supports the goal to maintain low cost overhead.
5. DISCUSSION
A substantive interpretation of the statistical, and coding
ﬁndings provided feedback for the next L2OrkMote proto-
type iteration in terms of design goals. The L2OrkMote
prototype enables the unrestricted freedom of two hands
and arms and calls to be exploited by the new designs
of computer-based musical instruments. For example, the
capability for less restricted hand choreography poses the
question of musical-gesture balance between the two hands.
The use of two controllers that mirror each other’s function-
ality may prime instrument designers to create NIMEs that
have identical or similar sound-synthesis parameters con-
trollable by each hand. In such situations, handedness may
cause potentially signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the performer’s
ability to control parameters. An alternative approach to
this issue is to leverage mirrored controllability design to
easily swap the dominant hand controls, rather than mir-
roring functionality of both hands.
Minimizing hand and arm strain by limiting the need for
a constant grip is particularly important given the target
ensemble’s focus on choreography that is rooted in Taiji
practice. However, the size and weight of the L2OrkMote
prototype can be further improved, such that it will reduce
the eﬀect that the palm and ﬁnger size variance has on a
performer’s comfort in using the controller.
The goal to minimize potential discomfort due to po-
tentially awkward and/or contextual button placement re-
mains to be achieved. Variance in palm and ﬁnger size cre-
ates the need to position buttons on one or the other side
278
of the structure’s center to accommodate shorter, or longer
ﬁngers. Thus, the design challenge is to ﬁnd the appropriate
size and shape for the buttons, such that they can be pressed
on either side. Further, the button placement may require
greater spacing to accommodate larger ﬁngers. While the
opportunity to have additional controls near user’s ﬁnger-
tips is likely advantageous, the authors posit the lack of
support of this aspect of L2OrkMote’s design in the user
pilot study is likely due to the lack of consideration in the
current prototype of the aforesaid variance in human hand
and ﬁnger size, as well as the choice of microswitches that
oﬀered very little travel and as a result felt fatiguing to use.
A core idea for a new controller design was optimizing
sensor location to improve the capturing of hand and arm
motion, and choreography. Testing the L2OrkMote in ac-
tual music performances will provide feedback necessary to
further optimize and calibrate sensor location. Maintaining
low overhead cost remains a critical goal, due to the ensem-
ble’s focus on K-12 outreach and low-cost implementation
that may encourage other similar ensembles to leverage sim-
ilar infrastructure. Although the prototype has eﬀectively
doubled the cost of the controller, its overall cost remains
signiﬁcantly below alternative commercial solutions.
The pilot study reveals that the L2OrkMote can serve
as a replacement to the WiiMote, due to being at least as
intuitive to use, as evidenced by the absence of statistical
signiﬁcance between participants with, and with no prior
knowledge in using the WiiMote. The study was performed
under unavoidable limitations, and it was designed to assess
the very ﬁrst L2OrkMote prototype. First, it was framed as
a comparison between the two controller setups, since the
aim was to replace the WiiMote with a controller that is
more focused on musical expression through ﬁnger-pressed
controls, and hand-gestural control choreography. This ap-
proach did not allow for making of comparisons between
two subject-groups that would have used only one or the
other controller setup. Second, the sample of the pilot-
study was small. Nevertheless, it provided critical feedback
on the current iteration of the L2OrkMote prototype, ensur-
ing that reconsidering the design goals for the next iteration
has been informed by empirical evidence. Third, this pilot-
study used only a simple computer-based musical instru-
ment for participants to experiment with. It had two-voice
polyphony (one-voice per hand) for the L2OrkMote setup,
and one-voice polyphony for the WiiMote setup. Since the
pilot-study aimed to gather feedback about the usability of
the L2OrkMote, it was designed to require less time from
each participant than what would have been required if
there were more instruments available to experiment with.
The diﬀerence in voice-polyphony is an essential capability
of the L2OrkMote setup, thus the pilot-study did not in-
clude a testing of the use of only one prototype controller
(on either hand). Fourth, the ﬁrst two L2OrkMote con-
trollers (one with left-hand, and one with right-hand orien-
tation) were built under the design principle of early test-
ing, which allows gathering feedback while in the process
of asynchronously conditioning diﬀerent aspects of the con-
troller. Therefore, minimizing the footprint of cables was
delayed to allow earlier testing. Making the cables more
compact is an objective for the next design iteration.
6. CONCLUSION
In contrast to handheld controllers, wearable controllers
not only improve the ability of performers to relax during
gesture-centric music performances, but also improve their
capability to focus on their gestures for musical expression.
L2OrkMote in its ﬁrst iteration has proven a compelling re-
placement to the existing WiiMote+MotionPlus+Nunchuk
controller setup. The prototype has met four of six as-
pirational goals. The remaining two were hampered by
design choices that can be addressed by further improv-
ing the button placement and size, the overall footprint of
the redesigned Nunchuk, as well as by further testing of
the relocated gyroscope’s sensitivity. The hardware calibra-
tion of the prototype controller should be also accompanied
by the software design principles for the creation of more
advanced gestural-controls that enable unrestricted hand-
choreography to empower performers of laptop orchestras.
The L2OrkMote was able to maintain low-cost, a critical
factor for its adoption by large musical ensembles and K-12
outreach scenarios. It also allows the transfer of dexterity
developed by practicing with WiiMote setups, and together
with its cost and maintenance needs is poised to further
enhance ensemble’s musical and gestural expressiveness.
The pilot-study participants already expressed a slight
preference towards the L2OrkMote setup, which was mostly
due to the ability to relax during its use. Thus, the pilot-
study supports the wearable approach to redesigning the
WiiMote controller. Moreover, the preference towards the
L2OrkMote setup was also due to less restrictive hand-
gesture choreography, when compared to the WiiMote setup.
Ultimately, the pilot-study validated many design goals in
reimagining a wearable controller for gesture-centric music
performances while providing invaluable feedback towards
the next L2OrkMote iteration.

Like many other aspects of L2Ork, the L2OrkMote develop-
ment will remain continuous and iterative. Informed by our
user study, we already see opportunities for a more strate-
gic placement of the IR camera that would enable its use in
low-cost position-aware tracking. We will explore possible
addition of a button to the forearm that may be triggered by
ﬂexing the forearm muscles. Also, we will look into further
reﬁnement of the four buttons and their form factor to make
their presses easier and more comfortable. There are ad-
ditional opportunities for minimizing redesigned Nunchuk’s
form factor by removing legacy connectors between the Mo-
tionPlus and Nunchuk circuitry. Most importantly, in the
coming months we will build 40 additional controllers to up-
grade the entire L2Ork ensemble controller infrastructure.
7. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
