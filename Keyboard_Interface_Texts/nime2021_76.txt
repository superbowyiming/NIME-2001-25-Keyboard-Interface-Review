ABSTRACT
Digital musical instrument (DMI) design and performance is primarily practiced by 
those with backgrounds in music technology and human-computer interaction. 
Research on these topics is rarely led by performers, much less by those without 
backgrounds in technology. In this study, we explore DMI design and performance 
from the perspective of a singular community of classically-trained percussionists. We 
use a practiced-based methodology informed by our skillset as percussionists to study 
how instrumental skills and sensibilities can be incorporated into the personalization 
of, and performance with, DMIs. We introduced a simple and adaptable digital musical 
instrument, built using the Arduino Uno, that individuals (percussionists) could 
personalize and extend in order to improvise, compose and create music (études). Our 
analysis maps parallel percussion practices emerging from the resultant DMI 
compositions and performances by examining the functionality of each Arduino 
instrument through the lens of material-oriented and communication-oriented 
approaches to interactivity.

1. INTRODUCTION
The proliferation of percussion and electronics constitutes two of Western classical 
music’s most significant advancements in the twentieth century. As newcomers for 
musical expression, percussion and electronic music practices are beset by growing 
pains as questions of standardization and sustainable repertoire development are 
confronted. Although the integration of live electronics in music performance is a 
relatively recent development, several generations of technology have already come 
and gone, leaving artists entering this field with no sustainable platform to work with. 
In this paper, we examine this issue through a creative experimental workshop to 
better understand how instrumental performance practice can be extended to include 
digital musical instruments (DMIs).

The incorporation of technology is emerging as a distinctive feature of contemporary 
musicians. George Lewis’s performer-based, interactive system Voyager is an early 
example that investigates the reciprocal, responsive relationship between the 
computer software and the performer. Mari Kimura’s career as a music technologist 
and concert violinist has allowed her to develop a system suited to amplify and expand 
her performance practice. Similarly, percussionist Levy Lorenzo has used his 
background in both percussion and engineering to develop his unique interactive 
performance system by remapping a commercially available video-game joystick, 
enabling him to develop and define the skills of controlling his DMI in a manner similar 
to playing the drum set.
While these musicians come from diverse music backgrounds, their work has similar 
goals: to create individualized technical setups that allow for improvisation and 
develop the interaction between performer and their machine. Their idiosyncratic 
performance practices reinforce studies that emphasize the impact of one’s 
background to the process of DMI design [1][2]. This paper expands on previous 
research in this area by serving as a case study for the integration of DMI design and 
performance into a single shared instrumental practice.
1.1 DMI Performance Practice
A common area of interest among New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) 
research concerns how DMIs are useful learning tools for developing musicianship and 
style [3] [4] [5]. The approaches and designs of these interfaces demonstrate 
commonalities in how the NIME community thinks about shaping an evolving 
performance practice. Tomás [3] notes that while students often brought “great artistic 
ideas” to his DMI design course, the students needed to work on the “adequate use of 
the body [... and] the artistic conceptualization and the realization of the original idea.” 
In other words, producing NIME interfaces simultaneously produces performance 
practice.  
Performance practice emerging from the construction of DMIs is a central component 
to McPherson and Lepri’s research [6]. Their study observed a group of music 
technologists tasked to construct a system using Pure Data under a set of time 
restraints. The authors found that “most control relationships fell into just a few 
categories of sensors manipulating fundamental sonic parameters, [...] usually in a 
linear, time-invariant, 1-to-1 manner.” In this study, the consciousness of compositional 
practice is tied to how they build the DMI. Both this study [6] and Tomás [3] indicate

how performance practice is produced simultaneously with the construction of the 
DMI. 
1.2 Percussion Performance Practice
Percussion is arguably one of the oldest forms of music making, with rich and diverse 
traditions around the world [7]. Despite this, the emergence of percussion as a 
canonical, Western instrument family only emerged in the nineteenth century, and it 
was not until the twentieth century that the percussion discipline developed its own 
repertoire [8]. Traditionally, a percussionist’s sonic palette is acoustic and consists of 
instruments of diverse backgrounds or repurposed everyday objects. Commercially 
produced electronic percussion instruments, such as the Malletkat and V-Drums, serve 
primarily as practice instruments and offer utility but are rarely used as the expressive 
instrument of choice in performance. Incorporation of electronics, a skillset that 
percussionists have little exposure to in their training, can seem like a burden to 
musicians that primarily work with acoustic instruments. However, the customization 
that electronic instruments afford could play a key role in future percussion 
improvisation and composition [9].
1.3 Practiced-Based Methodology
Practice-based research has been identified as a commonly-used framework to address 
musical interface design [10]. Draper et al. [11] define practiced-based research as 
that which “interrogates the authors’ performative processes.” Musicians/researchers 
Paul Draper, Stephen Emmerson, Vanessa Tomlinson and Andrew Brown use their own 
works as case studies to reflect and build upon one’s own existing performance 
practice.
We took a similar approach to this study, constructing it as a creative workshop with 
emphasis on the artistic outcome as the final goal. Participants were free to expand on 
their instruments and add components not covered in the workshop. By reviewing the 
documentation, we analyze the workshop process by employing a methodology loosely 
based on “grounded theory,” an approach that works well in practice-based research 
[12][4]. This approach involves generating, encoding, and categorizing data in order to 
construct a theoretical framework. By treating the workshop as a creative process, 
participants designed instruments that better reflected their own personal practice.

2. OUR STUDY
Our study was set up as a creative, experimental workshop organized by the 
Technology and Performance Interactive Research (TaPIR) Lab, which ran between 
October 3rd and December 3rd, 2020. It was divided into the following: 1) initial 
workshop, which lasted six hours a day for two days; 2) independent experimentation 
and composition between October 5th and late November; 3) individual tutorial 
session of 30 minutes with Lorenzo on November 12th and 19th; 4) live-streamed 
performance and presentation via YouTube on December 3rd, 2020. After the 
workshop, the participants submitted documentation of their work and answered an 
exit questionnaire.
The participants consisted of ten percussionists with an average of 14 years of 
experience, including one professor, two recent graduates, and seven current graduate 
students. Current students were paid as research assistants through the research 
fund. In addition to playing percussion, the participants also play other instruments: 
piano (7), woodwind (2), string (2), guitar (3), and brass (1). Some participants also 
compose regularly (5), and the majority of participants improvise regularly (8). The 
participants had little to no experience designing DMIs.
The goal of the workshop was to use a basic DMI to observe how a percussionist can 
learn, adapt, improvise, compose, and personalize their setup. In October 2020, Levy 
Lorenzo, Assistant Professor of Creative Technologies at The New School College of 
Performing Arts in New York City, led a weekend workshop over Zoom to teach 
participants (including the authors) how to use an Arduino Uno microcontroller board 
as a sounding instrument. Lorenzo’s “Beep Lab” instruments are a style of DIY 
electronics that he regularly performs with and teaches at The New School. The 
“Arduino prototype” that he taught in this workshop consists primarily of buttons that 
trigger square wave tones when pressed. Users can program the frequency of the tone 
and duration, as well as intermittent silence. Users can then program sequences of 
notes at varying rhythms into a single button. In teaching the basics of Arduino, 
Lorenzo offered the participants tools to incorporate DMIs into their percussion 
practice as a means of composition and/or improvisation.

The TaPIR Lab mailed each participant a kit that included the Arduino Uno, a 
breadboard, some buttons, LEDs, resistors, wires, a battery, and two speakers. On the 
first day of the workshop, Lorenzo explained some of the basic principles of circuitry, 
demonstrated how to program for Arduino, and had the participants build some simple 
sounding objects. 
The first object was a percussive instrument created with a battery, wires, a speaker 
and any small metal object. By attaching two wires to the positive and negative ends of 
the battery, clipping one side to the metal object and placing it on a speaker, and 
touching the object with the other wire, a rhythmic percussive sound is created. 
Lorenzo likened this to a percussion instrument, encouraging participants to treat it 
like they would a drum.

The second sounding object was a simplified version of what was to be our Arduino 
prototype. Through a series of exercises, Lorenzo led the participants through 
installation of LEDs, buttons, and wires into the breadboard. Lorenzo also gave the 
participants the code required to program a microcontroller board in Integrated 
Development Environment (IDE) and explained how to manipulate the code in order to 
change the pitch, speed, and button assignments. By the end of the first day, 
participants were able to press a button to create a tone or series of tones that emit 
from the instrument with a simultaneous flashing LED.
On the second day of the workshop, Lorenzo led the participants through the coding 
and wiring necessary to add buttons to their instrument. By using four buttons, 
Lorenzo demonstrated that the fifteen possible combinations of button presses can be 
used to create a fifteen-note chromatic scale.
After affirming that participants had understood the material, Lorenzo began 
encouraging personalization of the instruments. This included creating custom 
sequences or note combinations for buttons, changing pitches and speeds, and/or 
adding components to the breadboard. Lorenzo met with each participant privately for 
30 minutes to discuss their thoughts on the instrument and how they wanted to 
explore it further. The instruments were further developed through personal 
exploration and an additional meeting with Lorenzo before the final versions were 
presented on December 3rd. In the following sections, we briefly describe each 
instrument and/or composition constructed by the participants as well as their 
experience performing their instrument (A YouTube playlist with excerpts of each 
étude is available here). Although the participants’ names were publicly available for 
the concert, for this article we have assigned labels to discuss the participants and 
their work.

 2.1 Participant 1
Participant 1 added a potentiometer and photoresistor to the breadboard. By 
connecting the Arduino instrument through Max to Ableton, they used the additional 
inputs to manipulate various effects applied to the output. Their étude consisted of 
shifting arpeggios with washes of delay, reverb, and filter sweeps manipulated by the 
performer. They described their experience as “playing with electronic Lego.”
2.2 Participant 2
Participant 2 incorporated the Arduino into a percussion setup consisting of a snare 
drum and temple bowls. They triggered looping sequences with the Arduino that they 
accompanied with percussion sounds, and the hollow interior of the drum was used as 
a resonator. For Participant 2, the important aspect was “learning to shift one’s 
thinking into a more scientific/technological manner—instead of thinking of pitch as 
musicians do (e.g., C, C3, etc.), I was prompted to think of pitch in frequency.”

2.3 Participant 3
Participant 3 used their Arduino instrument as an arpeggiator. They mapped four 
pitches, one to each button, and kept the rhythms consistent so that there was fast 
rhythmic alternation between the pitches on the buttons when pressed. They combined 
the Arduino with a hi-hat and kick drum to create a groove-based étude that 
incorporated polyrhythms. They stated that their compositional “effort went into 
making sure that the development of the material made sense and was effective.”
 2.4 Participant 4
Participant 4 used the Arduino instrument to perform an arrangement of Koji Kondo’s 
video game track “Zelda’s Lullaby” (1991) from the Legend of Zelda franchise. They 
played the melody on the Arduino instrument with their right hand and vibraphone 
accompaniment with their left, roles that briefly switched mid-way through the 
performance. By mounting the Arduino instrument on a cardboard box, Participant 4 
could create a sense of vibrato when shaking it with their hand. They wanted to “make 
something easily digestible and pretty” so they opted for a melody known by video 
gamers.

2.5 Participant 5
Participant 5 added buttons onto the instrument in order to expand the range of 
possible pitch/rhythm combinations. The two buttons, outlined in Figure 9 in red, 
control the pitch combinations, while the four buttons outlined in blue correspond to 
pitch material. Their performance was a structured improvisation that revolved around 
consistent rhythmic motion. They found “the musical aspects of improvising, 
composing, and making sound were less satisfying,” but they enjoyed the “interaction 
between coding and building the circuit.”

2.6 Participants 6, 7, 8, and 9
Participants 6, 7, 8, and 9 were living together at the time of the workshop, so they 
opted to work as a group. They added a second breadboard to one Arduino Uno, 
making for a total of eight buttons. The buttons on one breadboard controlled pitches 
that blinked on and off at regular intervals, and the buttons on the second breadboard 
controlled the speed of the pitches. They built a second, similar instrument and 
performed with one person on each breadboard. The quartet performed a three-part 
étude featuring different styles. The first part featured a shifting melody-
accompaniment relationship between instrument pairs; the second part generated 
musical ideas using time signature 7/8; the third part explored the instrument’s 
timbral extremes. Members noted that they wanted to “feature a sense of 
collaboration” and “create something that took advantage of the seemingly simple 
interface [Lorenzo] gave us—take something simple and make it far more complex.”

2.7 Participant 10
Participant 10 chose to program fixed material: pressing a single button triggered a 
pre-programmed sequence of tones that lasted the entire performance. The main point 
of interest for them were the two speakers that came with the Arduino kit. Taking the 
cue from the limited dynamic control of the Arduino, they used half of a squash and the 
space surrounding them to amplify and mute speaker’s output. They simultaneously 
utilized throat singing as a way to amplify and merge with the Arduino tones, 
additionally noting that subsequent performers of their étude need to “find a way to 
engage and blend with electronic sounds.”

The flexibility of the Arduino prototype allowed for a wide range of design and 
performance possibilities. Unlike research that addresses constraints in DMI design 
and performance [13] [4], participants in our workshop were not given any physical or 
technical constraints other than that their final work must incorporate the Arduino 
prototype in some form. Participants could modify and add to the Arduino setup, use 
functions not taught in the workshop, and combine their instrument with other 
instruments and processes. Through analysis of recordings and documentation, we are 
still able to observe constraints and the participants’ reactions to those constraints in a 
manner similar to Gurevich et al. [4]. The constraints present in this study consisted 
mostly of perceived and external constraints: those that were self-imposed by the 
participants based on their perception of the instrument’s capabilities, and those based 
on norms according to the “genre of music, performance practice, and social 
convention” [4]. The perceived constraints of the Arduino prototype were particularly 
relevant because of the participants’ overall lack of experience with Arduino and 
customizable electronics. Table 1 summarizes the significant alterations that 
participants made to the Arduino prototype.
3.1 Finding New Hardware/Software
The amount of time given between workshop and performance allotted ample 
opportunity for participants to seek out components and functions outside of the scope 
of the workshop. Participant 2 discovered and used the loop() function as a core part of 
their composition; others added small components such as knobs and different-colored 
LEDs. Participant 1 went the furthest with their technical exploration, installing a 
photoresistor and potentiometer to control various effects through Max4Live.

3.2 Button Mappings
The button mapping used by participants constitute three categories: 
systematic, combinatorial, and specific. Participants 3 and 4 were systematic in their 
button mapping in that there was a consistent relationship across all of the button 
combinations. Participant 3 used their buttons as a simple arpeggiator that assigned 
one pitch per button, and Participant 4 programmed a diatonic scale that could be 
played with certain fingerings. Participants 5 and 6–9 used combinatorial mappings: 
they added extra buttons that modified the original four buttons to create a 
combination of functions. Participant 5 used the extra two buttons to create four 
“settings” for a chromatic scale, and Participants 6–9 used the second set of buttons to 
modify the speed of the pitches played by the first set of buttons. The remaining 
participants assigned specific mappings to their buttons, opting for mappings 
customized uniquely for their composition. Participants 1 and 2 programmed the 
buttons with sequences of varying speeds and pitches to use as source material in 
their performances. Participant 10 took the sequencing to its extreme, compiling all 
programming to a single button.
3.3 Material Manipulation 
In an effort to go beyond the sound of the square wave, several participants discovered 
methods to manipulate the timbre of their instruments. Participant 2 used a snare 
drum as a resonating object for the speaker by taping the speaker face down on the 
drumhead and also explored programming the loop() function “incorrectly” so that the 
sound would intermittently freeze. Participants 6–9 discovered that when they 
programmed the notes to repeat at speeds of 30 milliseconds or faster, the speed 
modulated the pitch to create a second, simultaneous frequency. Additionally, the 
participants in the group experimented with disrupting the wiring of one of the 
instruments: completing the circuit through scratching the wire ends on the face of a 
coin produced unintended hiccups and glitches in the sound. Participant 10 created 
volume control by closing one side of the open speaker cone and using their hands to 
close and open the speakers.
4. CREATIVE AGENCY IN PERCUSSIONIST-CONCEIVED DMIs
Mudd [14] defines communication-oriented and material-oriented perspectives as two 
approaches that directly address “entanglements of agency” in music and Human-
Computer Interaction. The communication-oriented approach implies a sense of 
transparency in a DMI through which the performer can directly communicate their 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical ExpressionOn Parallel Performance Practices: Some Observations on Personalizing DMIs as
Percussionists
15
musical ideas, and the material-oriented approach involves an acknowledgement of the 
technology itself, that the navigation of material can actually become a source for 
ideas. These categorizations, while useful, create a polarity that may not accurately 
represent the full relationship of agency present in music technology. Karen Barad’s 
concept of “intra-action” [15] is a more holistic take on agency, described by Bowers et 
al. as “one where agency shifts in the mid-ways between person and thing” [13]. As 
mentioned by Mudd, “Intra-action steers away from either extreme position—that the 
technology is dominated by the user, or that the user is dominated by the technology—
by questioning the localization of agency within individuals (human or non-human)” 
[14]. Here, Mudd employs Barad to demonstrate the entanglements of agency in 
musical interactions. Although the two approaches present a binary view of agency, 
this theoretical framework nevertheless allows us to map the tendencies of each 
project in such a way that informs the relationship between musical background and 
DMI design. 
It is important to note that there is a difference in agency between the design process 
and the creation/performance process. The process of designing the Arduino 
instruments is inherently a material-oriented one; each participant grappled with the 
perceived constraints of the Arduino prototype presented through the buttons, coding, 
square tone, and small speakers. The creative process and the performance of the 
études themselves, however, are open to more nuanced interpretations between the 
two categories of interaction. In the following paragraphs, we will discuss the material-
oriented and communication-oriented approaches with respect to the participants’ 
études and performances in order to categorize different approaches for further 
analysis.
Relatively few participants pursued a communication-oriented approach in their 
études. For example, only one participant, Participant 4, adopted what would be 
considered the “idiomatic” approach and mapped individual notes to button 
combinations to create a scale. Participant 4 performed in a lyrical, expressive manner 
and incorporated visual gestures (finger vibrato on buttons similar to the ones 
performed on the violin) resulting in a clear communication of musical expression. 
Participant 3 instead approached their Arduino instrument rhythmically, playing in a 
tightly-locked groove with a hi-hat and kick drum. Despite material limitations, the 
above approaches situate agency in the performer to take on a communication-
oriented approach.

Percussionists
16
The majority of participants adopted the material-oriented approach instead. 
Participant 2 used the sound emitted from the speaker not only to amplify the sonic 
result, but also to create vibrato by quickly pushing the speaker down onto the 
drumhead. Additionally, they took advantage of a glitch of the software itself as a 
mechanism for timbral expansion. Their investment in the hardware and software 
demonstrates the material-driven approaches to developing timbral possibilities.
There are, of course, a number of factors at play when considering the prominence of 
the material-oriented approach. Lepri and McPherson [2] found that material-oriented 
approaches to design correlate with backgrounds in improvisation and experimental 
music. The experimental and improvisatory contexts within which this workshop was 
situated act as external constraints that also significantly influence a participant’s 
decision to adopt the material-oriented approach. Focusing our discussion around the 
material exploration in percussion practice, however, allows us to highlight a unique 
similarity between approaches to percussion and DMI practices.
Participant 10 demonstrates that some approaches are nuanced and can only be 
placed between the two orientations of material and communication. They manipulated 
the timbre through the speakers, modifying them so the speakers could be closed and 
opened like a pair of cymbals. The use of visual gestures simultaneously enacted 
theatricality in the space around them and created a panning effect. Here, the 
performance can be interpreted as simultaneously material-oriented and 
communication-oriented. 
5. DISCUSSION
Lepri and McPherson [2] compare “go-between elements” observed between the 
backgrounds of the participants and the instruments that they designed. Our study 
reveals a number of go-between elements from percussionist to DMI that reveal the 
tendencies and preferences of percussionists with respect to DMI design. 
Contextualizing these through the framework of communication and material-oriented 
approaches allows for parallels to be drawn between percussion and DMI performance 
practices.
5.1 Timbral Exploration
The dominance of material-oriented performance in this study might be explained by 
the centrality of material-oriented approaches in percussion performance practice. 
Composer Vinko Globokar [16] suggests that there are two opposing philosophies that 
divide up the percussion world. The first one uses the action of striking as the main 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical ExpressionOn Parallel Performance Practices: Some Observations on Personalizing DMIs as
Percussionists
17
concept and designates each instrument a singular timbre while the second one 
pursues a “differentiated palette of timbres and articulations from the single 
instrument.” Instead of looking for more instruments to make sounds, one looks for 
more sounds from the same object. While it is true that other instrumental practices 
also actively consider timbre, the multiplicity of objects that are considered percussion 
instruments afford limitless timbral possibilities to the percussionist.
Our results suggest that by exploring either hardware or software, timbral 
manipulation was a key concept for Participants 2, 4, 6–9, and 10. The investment in 
hardware to generate performance material was employed by Participants 2, 4, and 
10, who each manipulated the speaker in various ways. Participants 2 and 6–9 also 
exploited glitches in the software as a source of timbral diversity. Each of those 
participants found ways to go beyond or more deeply explore the sound of the square 
wave tone.
5.2 Percussion Proficiency
Like all institutionally taught instruments, percussionists learn proficiency on their 
instrument through a series of standard exercises and repertoire. The snare drum is 
considered the home instrument to most percussionists as many technical skills are 
mastered on this instrument [17]. Some basic skills include rudiments (e.g., 
paradiddle) and rolls (e.g., single, double stroke and buzz) [18]. This training is not 
only meant to elevate the overall technical ability of the player but also to build 
precision and consistency in the execution of musical notation and communication of 
musical ideas.
Technical development is just as important when learning a new DMI [19], as is the 
case for the participants in this study. The two months between the workshop and 
performance allowed participants time to develop precision on their personalized 
instruments. Mechanics such as multi-button combinations need practice to be 
performed concisely, otherwise the Arduino Uno would not register the action as a 
single button press. By playing one instrument with each hand, Participant 4 used limb 
independence, an important technique in percussion practice. Participant 3 also 
demonstrated independence between hands and feet. Rhythmic precision was an 
important aspect of the performances by Participant 3 and Participants 6–9: the former 
demonstrated rhythmic precision as a soloist, whereas the latter employed rhythmic 
precision in the ensemble setting. In all of these projects, precision was a means to an 
expressive end; it is intertwined with the communication-oriented approach to 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical ExpressionOn Parallel Performance Practices: Some Observations on Personalizing DMIs as

18
performance because it expands the technical (and therefore, expressive) palette of 
the percussionist.
5.3 Multiple Percussion
Multiple percussion, or multi-percussion, is a term used to “describe a piece of music 
which requires one percussionist to play more than one instrument” [17]. The 
participants’ incorporation of the Arduino into personalized setups reflects this 
paradigm of multi-percussion as an expressive apparatus for the classically-trained 
percussionist. In addition, there exist several parallels between Arduino instruments 
and multi-percussion performance. Both are modular and allow for a certain extent of 
personalization. Multi-percussion setups often incorporate a number of “found sounds” 
that consist of repurposed everyday objects, resulting in a sonic palette that resembles 
the aesthetics of Arduino and DIY electronics at large [20].
While Participant 2 used the snare drum in their setup as a way to explore timbre, they 
also played the drum itself. In this way, the use of the drum can be perceived as 
indicative of both the material and communication-oriented approaches. Participants 3 
and 4 used multi-percussion setups in a more typical fashion, having grouped their 
Arduino with percussion instruments that either blend with or accompany the two.
6. CONCLUSION
We used a practice-based research methodology to allow the study participants to 
creatively transfer their percussion skills to learn, play, and compose for their Arduino 
prototype. Our reflection has allowed us to identify parallel concepts between the 
learning, design, and performance practice of percussion and DMI. Despite the 
participants’ limited background with this technology, everyone reported that by the 
end of the workshop they understood the basics of the Arduino prototype and felt 
generally comfortable with the technology—an encouraging sign that points to the 
possibility of incorporating DMIs into percussion practice on a larger scale. This was 
due in part to the accessibility of Arduino microcontroller boards and software: despite 
completing this workshop over Zoom, it was easy to put the instruments together by 
following diagrams and copy-pasting the code.
Bijsterveld and Schulp’s [21] concept of recasting tradition for musical instrument 
design suggests that successful modifications to the design of classical instruments 
should be framed as a re-adjustment of tradition. As a relatively young discipline, 
percussion is more susceptible to this continued molding of tradition. The parallels 
between the Arduino instruments and percussion practice indicates that recasting

percussion tradition by incorporating modular electronics such as Arduino instruments 
would be feasible. The go-between elements discussed with respect to the workshop 
also serve to inform future investigations into integrating DMIs and percussion 
practice. Further research in multiple directions, such as commissioning works for 
Arduino and percussion and workshops with different groups of instrumentalists, is 
needed to investigate methods for DMI incorporation into existing practices.
