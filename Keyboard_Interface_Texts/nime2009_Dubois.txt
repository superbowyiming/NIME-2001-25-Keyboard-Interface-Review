Bioluminescence 
R. Luke DuBois and Lesley Flanigan  
Bioluminescence is a two-person improv ised performance to be considered for 
either concert or club performance. The performance is improvised and of 
variable length, and consists of a vo calist (Lesley Flanigan) and a laptop 
performer (R. Luke DuBois). All the materi al generated from the laptop is taken 
from the vocalist during that performance (no pre-sampling or synthesis) and the 
laptop performer’s sole interface is  through typing on the keyboard. 
Visualizations of the sound are projected as we ll. The performance makes 
extensive use of a phase vo coder to transform the voice as an act of memory 
and intimate conversation, by taking pr eviously sung phrases and re-inserting 
them into the performance at difference sp eeds / pitches, in different order, and 
layered in different ways. In addition, the performance tackles what I see to be 
the core issue of the laptop comput er as NIME, which is the issue of 
transparency (everyone has one...) versus opacity (...but no one knows what 
you’re doing with it).
