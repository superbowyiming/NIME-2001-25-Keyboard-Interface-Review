ABSTRACT
This paper presents a knowledge-based, data-driven method
for using data describing action-sound couplings collected
from a group of people to generate multiple complex map-
pings between the performance movements of a musician
and sound synthesis. This is done by using a database of
multimodal motion data collected from multiple subjects
coupled with sound synthesis parameters. A series of sound
stimuli is synthesised using the sound engine that will be
used in performance. Multimodal motion data is collected
by asking each participant to listen to each sound stimu-
lus and move as if they were producing the sound using
a musical instrument they are given. Multimodal data is
recorded during each performance, and paired with the syn-
thesis parameters used for generating the sound stimulus.
The dataset created using this method is then used to build
a topological representation of the performance movements
of the subjects. This representation is then used to inter-
actively generate training data for machine learning algo-
rithms, and deﬁne mappings for real-time performance. To
better illustrate each step of the procedure, we describe an
implementation involving clarinet, motion capture, wear-
able sensor armbands, and waveguide synthesis.

1. OVERVIEW
This method is a tool for sound designers, composers, and
performers. It allows them to use data describing action-
sound couplings collected from a group of people to generate
multiple complex mappings for sound interaction. In other
words, this is a technique for sampling music-related embod-
ied knowledge from a group of people and designing sonic
interactions based on this information.
The structure of the method is outlined in Fig. 1. The

•Design the sound stimuli using the synthesis engine
that will be employed in performance.
•Present the sound stimuli to the group of participants,
asking them to move as if they were producing the
sounds with the instrument they are given and collect
multimodal data during each performance.
•Extract features from the multimodal data and deﬁne
a topological representation of the performances.
•Select a point in the topology to generate the cor-
responding data and train a machine learning model
for real-time interaction with the generated data and
the synthesis parameters used for producing the sound
stimulus.
•Use the resulting mapping for composition and per-
formance.
The last two steps can be reiterated to generate new map-
pings from the same dataset.
A salient feature of the method is that data can be ob-
tained from a vast a group of people and – at the same
time – individual idiosyncrasies and commonalities are pre-
served and mapped. This information can then be used for
interaction design.
We will describe the steps of the procedure individually,
both in general terms and by illustrating how the method
was implemented using a clarinet, a synthesis engine based
on a ﬂute physical model, motion capture, and armbands
with EMG and IMU/MARG sensors.
2. BACKGROUND AND MOTIV ATION
The main motivation behind this method is to make use of
the music-related movement knowledge of a group of people
to deﬁne motion-sound mappings for live interaction. The
resulting mappings take advantage of the ecological knowl-
edge of action-sound couplings of the group of people that
participated to the multimodal motion data collection.
A topological representation of the motion data aims at
providing an interpretation of what is shared and what
is idiosyncratic among the participants, thus allowing re-
searchers and performers to take into account commonali-
ties and individualities when generating the training data
for the machine learning model. The interactive method
based on this representation allows training data to be gen-
erated that either preserves certain peculiarities of individ-
ual subjects, or is based on features shared by many partici-
pants. This gives more control over the transparency and in-
tuitiveness of the resulting movement-sound mapping. This
is particularly desirable for expressive applications such as
music performance, where idiosyncrasies and non-obvious
mappings could be deliberately employed for expressive pur-
poses.
From a theoretical point of view, a central assumption is
that studying the relationships between gestures and sound
help us understand how movement contributes to structure
our experience of music [12] and that the ecological knowl-
edge about action-sound couplings guides our perception of
artiﬁcially created action-sound relationships [15]. Thus,
the design of action-sound mappings would beneﬁt from
action-sound couplings that have similar properties and are
part of this ecological knowledge.
This method employs procedures and techniques for data
collection and analysis analogous to those typically adopted
in experiments of music cognition and systematic musicol-
ogy. An example is the study by Godøy et al. [13], who anal-
ysed video recordings of people mimicking piano-playing
movements while listening to musical excerpts. This was
done to explore the ability of listeners with diﬀerent musical
backgrounds to reproduce the geometry and the dynamics of
movements related to piano performance. Teixeira et al. [25]
employed similar techniques to evaluate the gesture consis-
tency of a group of clarinetists over several performances.
In our case, the experimental procedures serve a diﬀerent
purpose, namely the creation of gesture-to-sound mapping
informed by action-sound couplings. The main goal of this
method is to obtain data describing how a group of people
associate instrumental movements to certain musical sounds
and observe shared and individual features of this move-
ments. This data can be seen as a snapshot of the ecological
knowledge that a group of individuals has of certain action-
sound couplings related to the musical instrument they are
‘performing’ the sound stimuli with. Rather than perform-
ing statistical analyses aimed at corroborating a hypothesis
or exploring recurrent patterns in music-related movement,
here the data is used for deﬁning movement-sound map-
pings that take advantage of speciﬁc information regarding
how a group of people embody clarinet performance move-
ments. Unlike the research carried out by Godøy et al. [13],
non-experts also use a real instrument. This is done in order
to obtain movements that are constrained by the physical
aﬀordances of the clarinet.
Still, the purpose of this method is not to substitute in-
teraction design choices based on intuition with decisions
informed by quantitative data. Rather, these techniques
are aimed at providing a method for interpreting and utilis-
ing movement information for musical interaction. In fact,
this approach may also be used in conjunction with other
mapping strategies. To attempt an analogy with common
electronic music production techniques, this method can be
seen as a way ofsampling movement knowledge from a group
of individuals. This information can then be manipulated
and repurposed, as it is common practice with audio sam-
ples. The size and composition of the group this informa-
tion is sampled from can also be considered a factor that
can be deliberately manipulated by the composer. For ex-
ample, one might be interested in working with movement
data collected from a small group of individuals of speciﬁc
ethnicity, gender, age group, etc. as opposed to analysing
large databases that describe movements of a vast popula-
tion. This method aims at preserving and exploring vari-
ability, and is inﬂuenced by human-centred approaches to
machine learning [10]. The following sections describe how
to implement the method, which is informed by interdisci-
plinary scientiﬁc studies and designed to serve artistic and
interaction design purposes.
3. DESIGN OF SOUND STIMULI
The set of sound stimuli to present to the participants dur-
ing data collection is designed by the composer/performer
by recording and editing sequences of synthesis parameters.
Playing back these sequences allow the physical model to
generate the desired sound.
In this implementation, the sound stimuli were designed
and synthesised using a ﬂute model algorithm based on
waveguide synthesis [24, 23]. It was originally designed
by Bessell [1] and used in his piece Ophidian. Parameter
sequences were deliberately designed to obtain some exam-
ples of various articulations that can be achieved using the
ﬂute model. It should be noted that obtaining sounds that
closely resembled those produced by a real ﬂute was not our
goal. Rather, we aimed at obtaining sounds that preserve
some timbral qualities of wind instruments but go beyond
what a conventional wind instrument can achieve in terms
of pitch, tone, and dynamics.
The sound stimuli were synthesised in Max. Nineteen
parameters of the physical model were exposed for control,
therefore each sound sequence is made up of nineteen pa-
rameter envelopes. The audio output of the physical model
and all the synthesis parameters were recorded in separate
tracks of a MuBu container [11] and then saved as SDIF
ﬁles. Doing so allows re-synthesis of the stimuli in real time
using the parameter data and storing recorded audio for
reference. Six stimuli of length between 10 and 28 seconds
were eventually selected.
It is worth mentioning that diﬀerent strategies can be
adopted to record the synthesis parameters of the stimuli:
from manually designing each parameter envelope with a
graphical editor to using other controllers to perform and
record parameter modulations.

Figure 2: Multimodal conﬁguration: locations of the rigid
bodies and the Myo sensor armbands. The clarinet was
ﬁtted with three single markers and then deﬁned as a single
rigid body with the pivot point at the centre.
Once the parameter sequences for the synthesis of the stim-
uli are deﬁned, individuals from a group are asked to mime
a performance of each sound using the musical instrument
of choice. Motion, IMU, and EMG data is recorded during
each trial. This produces a multimodal database contain-
ing data describing the performance movements each par-
ticipant associated to each stimulus aligned to the synthesis
parameters used to generate the sound.
4.1 Apparatus
The movement of the participants were recorded using a
multimodal set-up involving a six-camera optical motion
capture system (OptiTrack Flex 3) and two Myo sensor arm-
bands. The motion capture system was used to track seven
rigid bodies, each one constituted by three or four reﬂective
markers. The locations of the rigid bodies were as follows:
head, left upper arm, right upper arm, left hand, right hand,
sacral wand (hips), and clarinet (see Fig. 2).
The 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) data (3D position coor-
dinates and orientation quaternions) was streamed to Max
via Open Sound Control (OSC) using a custom MATLAB
script. The participants also wore two Myo armbands, one
on each forearm. The devices streamed IMU/MARG 9DoF
data and EMG data over a dedicated OSC port. The IMU
data is constituted by 3D acceleration, 3D angular velocity,
and 3D orientation Euler angles, while the EMG data has
eight channels per armband. The sound stimuli were re-
synthesised in real time during the recording session using
the previously recorded parameters and were played back
via a pair of Genelec 8020C loudspeakers.
4.2 Task and Data Collection Procedure
Each participant was informed about the purpose of the
data collection and asked to wear the Myo armbands and
the rigid body markers as described in section 4.1.
The participant was then given a clarinet ﬁtted with three
reﬂective markers and with the reed removed. The em-
bouchure of the clarinet was protected with a layer of food
grade cling ﬁlm, which was replaced after every individual
session. This was done for hygiene purposes and in order to
allow each participant to comfortably use the embouchure.
For each of the six stimuli, each participant was ﬁrst asked
to carefully listen to the sound and imagine the movements
they would do if they were to perform that sound using
the clarinet. This listening phase could be repeated how-
ever many times the participant wanted. The participants
were allowed to rehearse the movements while listening to
the sound in order to ﬁnd the movements and actions that,
in their opinion, best matched the idea of performing that
sound using the clarinet. After having suﬃciently famil-
iarised with the sound and decided the movements, the par-
ticipant was asked to mimic a performance along the sound
for three times. Participants were also instructed to per-
form each stimulus consistently (i.e. trying to perform the
same performance movements they devised during the lis-
tening phase the best way they can throughout the three
takes). In order to help the participant to start the perfor-
mance synchronised with the sound, each stimulus playback
was introduced by a four-beat count in at 120 bpm tempo.
During each take, all the data from the rigid bodies motion
tracking and the EMG and IMU data of the Myo armbands
were recorded in a single, multitrack MuBu container in
Max. The synthesis parameters and audio of each stimulus
were also recorded in the same container synchronously, and
so was the click track that produced the count in before the
stimulus. Sensor and control parameters were sampled at
50 Hz, while audio at 44.1 kHz. All the performances were
also ﬁlmed using a Canon DSLR.
4.3 Participants
Eight participants took part in the data collection phase of
this project (7 male, 1 female, aged 24-53, average age: 31,
SD of age: 9.0), which took place at the ICCMR Studio,
Plymouth University, in June 2016. All the participants
had some musical background.
It this important to point out that in this context whether
the sample is representative of a larger population is not of
major concern. In fact, as pointed out in section 2, select-
ing a biased sample could be done deliberately in order to
obtain datasets that yield peculiar mappings.
5. DATA PROCESSING AND
DISTANCE MEASURE
Following the data collection phase, the content of the mul-
timodal database is processed and analysed. This section
describes the steps necessary to represent the performance
movements for each sound stimulus as a point in a feature
space. This is done by selecting and extracting motion fea-
tures from the data and adopting a distance measure to
locate each trajectory on the feature space. The distance
relationships between all the movements the participants
performed in response to a single stimulus deﬁne a map: a
gestural topology of the movement reactions to that sound.
This representation is useful to understand diﬀerences and
similarities between each performance in relation to the se-
lected features. Points clusters in regions of the feature
space would indicate that a group of participants have per-
formed similar movements, whereas outliers might suggest
a more idiosyncratic performance.
5.1 Feature Selection and Extraction
We then selected the locations of the body and the motion
features on which we wanted to focus on for creating the
mappings for real time performance. In this implementa-
tion, the features selected are the Quantity of Motion of
the clarinet rigid body and the envelope of the mean abso-
lute value of the right arm EMG data.
Quantity of Motion (QoM) is a motion feature widely
used in the study of body movement in music [14] and it
is also employed for detecting aﬀective states and emotion
[20]. Fenza et al. [5] deﬁne Quantity of Motion (QoM) as
the sum of Euclidean distances between successive points in
a time window. Rotation angles can also be considered in
order to obtain a descriptor that takes advantage of 6DoF
information:
6DoFQoM(t) =
N−1∑
k=0
β1 |∥qt−k∥−∥qt−k−1∥| +
+β2 |∥pt−k∥−∥pt−k−1∥|
(1)
where ∥q∥is the norm of the orientation quaternion, and
β1 and β2 are weights to balance the contributions of trans-
lational and rotational motion data. The values for each
frame are summed over a time window of length N sam-
ples.
The EMG feature used in this implementation is the mean
of the absolute values of all the eight EMG channels of the
armband. This value can be considered an index of the
overall muscular activity in the forearm. It is calculated as
follows:
MAV = 1/N
N∑
k=1
|Xk|. (2)
X is the vector with the EMG data and N is equals to
the size of X, which in this case is equal to 8 since the Myo
has eight EMG channels.
5.2 Distance Measure and Feature Space
A distance measure needs to be adopted in order to locate
each performance in a two-dimensional feature space deﬁned
by the selected features. We used Dynamic Time Warping
(DTW) to measure the distance between the feature vectors
of each take. DTW returns the smallest distance between
trajectories if warped, therefore it accounts for the fact that
sequences might shift slightly forward or backward in time.
It is widely used for time series analysis and classiﬁcation
tasks [22, 21] and for real-time gesture recognition [9].
As described in section 4.2 above, the participants per-
formed along each stimulus three times. Fig. 3a shows the
locations in the feature space of all the performances along
stimulus 5. The locations of the points were obtained by
placing the mean of all the performances at origin of the
axes and using DTW to calculate the distances of each point
from the mean. In Fig. 3a, the trials performed by the same
participant are displayed with the same colour. By connect-
ing the respective takes and ﬁlling the resulting triangular
area we obtain a visual representation of the consistency
of each participant across the three trials. The circle in-
side each triangle is the centroid obtained by averaging the
locations of the three performances. Areas of the feature
space with higher concentration of points suggest shorter
distances between participants and therefore more similar-
ity in the selected features.
6. TOPOLOGICAL REPRESENTATION
AND SYNTHESIS OF TRAINING DATA
Van Nort et al. [26] describe the topological perspectives
of adopting a holistic conceptual approach to mapping be-
tween control and sound parameters. In particular, they
focus on “functional properties related to a mapping’s geo-
metric and topological structure in the case of continuous,
many-to-many mappings”. Rather than focusing on the in-
terconnections between individual parameters, a functional
view of parameter mapping is concerned with the structural
properties of the set of input and output parameters. These
properties determine a mapping topology, which deﬁnes “the
nature of the continuity, connectedness, and boundary deﬁ-
nition in the mapping association (or associations) between
control and sound sets.” [26, p. 7].
In this case, the topology deﬁned using the distance mea-
sure described in the previous section is used to synthesise
the training data for the machine learning model that will
be used for real-time interaction. In order to represent each
participant as a single point in the feature space, the fea-
tures describing the three performances along the stimulus
were averaged. The resulting time series and corresponding
distances in the feature space are exported from MATLAB
and loaded in Max.
Using the radial basis function interpolation [8] Max tool
RBFI, each participant is represented as the centre of a
Gaussian kernel [18] in the feature space. The largest graph
on the top left corner of Fig. 3b shows the Gaussian ker-
nels obtained from the same data used to plot the triangles
shown in Fig. 3a. Each point in this feature space corre-
sponds to a temporal feature set obtained by continuously
interpolating between the features extracted from the per-
formances of the participants. This is done by using the
distances from the selected point to calculate the contri-
bution (weight) of the feature set of each participant at
that point of the feature space. The two graphs on the left
(blue and red) show the interpolated features corresponding
to the point in the feature space selected using the cursor
(white cross).
From a practical point of view, this interactive display
of the data allows to intuitively create a feature set that
can be used in conjunction with the synthesis parameters
of the stimulus to train a machine learning model for real-
time interaction. Displaying the data of each participant
as a location in a feature space has the purpose of com-
municating certain topological qualities of the data. The
distance relationships between the Gaussian kernels give
higher-level information about how the participants moved
to the sound that is useful for deﬁning the interaction. For
example, placing the cursor close to a cluster with several
participants would result in training data that is closer to
how the participants in that cluster performed along the
stimulus. From this perspective, clusters can be consid-
ered as diﬀerent ‘styles’ of performance movements along
the same sound stimulus. Positioning the cursor away from
clusters and closer to outliers would instead result in train-
ing data that is more idiosyncratic: representative of how a
single individual reacted to and performed along the sound
stimulus. Clusters – on the other hand – suggest that a
group of participants performed the sound stimulus with
a movement that has certain shared features. Ostensibly,
moving closer to a highly-populated cluster would result in
training data that would produce mappings that are more
transparent and intuitive for the population of that clus-
ter. Conversely, data closer to less populated areas and
outliers would instead lead to less predictable interactions.
However, the characteristics of the resulting mappings also
depends on the chosen features and the machine learning
algorithm used.
7. INTERACTION MODEL AND PERFOR-
MANCE
The data generated by selecting a point in the feature space
paired with the synthesis parameters of the corresponding
sound stimulus can then be used to train a machine learn-
ing model for real-time interaction. Various algorithms can
be adopted to do this. Some of the established supervised
learning methods that make use of multiple examples to

recognise gesture classes are based on Hidden Markov Mod-
els (HMM) [16] and Support Vector Machines (SVM) [19].
In particular, hybrid methods based on gesture templates
and statistical recognition are employed for real-time con-
tinuous control using a limited number of training sam-
ples [2].
Machine learning is also widely used for implementing in-
teractive approaches to gesture-sound mapping. Fiebrink
et al. [6] use supervised learning to build a training dataset
from the gestures users perform along a musical score. Carami-
aux et al. [3] use a perception-action loop as a design prin-
ciple for gesture-sound mapping in digital musical instru-
ments. Fran¸ coise et al. [7] employ HMM to conjointly model
control and synthesis parameters.
In this instance, we used the Max implementation of the
Gesture Variation Follower (GVF)1 [4]. The training data
obtained with the procedure described in the previous sec-
tion is used as a gesture template for GVF. In performance,
the two features used for analysing the movements of the
participants are calculated in real time and fed to GVF. The
synthesis parameters that produced the stimulus the partic-
ipants performed along to are loaded in the physical mod-
elling patch. During performance, the GVF continuously
outputs the temporal alignment with the gesture template.
This information is used to move through the temporal di-
mension of the synthesis parameters of the sound stimulus,
thus mapping the movements of the performer to sounds
generated by the physical model.
For this implementation, GVF was chosen over other al-
gorithms because – by modelling the temporal information
of the gesture template – it is able to detect when the move-
ment described in the template is performed backwards.
Moreover, it allows for continuous interaction with the phys-
ical model without needing to deﬁne the beginning and end
of a gesture. These characteristics allow us to obtain diﬀer-
ent sounds and articulations by interacting with the synthe-
sis parameter space deﬁned by the sound stimulus. Gesture-
sound mapping can be easily redeﬁned by repositioning the
cursor on another region of the topological representation
and generate new training data. This allows to interac-
tively explore the diﬀerent mappings that the feature space
deﬁned by the movement of the participants aﬀords.

The sound palette can be expanded beyond what can be
achieved using the parameters of a single sound stimulus.
This is done by repeating the procedure described in this
and the previous sections for the other stimuli, thus generat-
ing additional templates for GVF paired with the synthesis
parameters of the corresponding stimuli.
In performance, the amount of rigid bodies and sensor
armbands worn by the performer can be reduced to the
ones that are necessary for extracting the selected motion
features in real time. This results in a less cumbersome
performance setup. For performing with the two features
selected in this example, only the right Myo armband and
the clarinet’s rigid body markers would be necessary. How-
ever, the data from the other rigid bodies and sensors is not
superﬂuous, as it can be stored and used for other compo-
sitions based on the same instrument family and for gener-
ating other mappings based on other motion features and
locations of the body.
8. DISCUSSION
The motion features selected for the clarinet example are
relatively simple. Using more sophisticated features and
more complex synthesis engines could in principle lead to
more complex motion-sound interactions. The same proce-
dure can be applied using features that involve more body
locations or full-body motion descriptors. This implemen-
tation is limited to two features also for usability purposes.
This allows for a clear representation of the performances
in a two-dimensional feature space and a simple graphi-
cal user interface can be employed to select a point in the
topology and generate training data. Working with three or
more features is also possible, in which case a diﬀerent way
of presenting the topology of the performance data should
be adopted. A 3D representation is certainly a straight-
forward solution but more complex, multidimensional rela-
tions could be represented using alternative methods such
as topological networks [17]. We have described an instance
were marker-based motion capture is used. However, the
method is hardware agnostic, and can be implemented also
using cheaper and more portable sensor technologies.
If movement aﬀects our experience of music and therefore
can be used as a musical feature, data describing music-
related movement contains information that can aid musical
composition and performance. This method was designed to
harness multimodal data sets to generate sonic interactions
based on shared embodied knowledge.
