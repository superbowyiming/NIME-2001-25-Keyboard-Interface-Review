1. INTRODUCTION
The Hexenkessel (witch’s cauldron) is an augmented mu-
sical instrument, combining a classical orchestral timpani
with multitouch tracking technology and embedded video
projection. Unlike traditional acoustic instruments, where
sound production is inseparably linked to the physical con-
struction, the Hexenkessel acts as a gestural interface for
computer music, controlling live-electronics, sound synthe-
sis and even stage-lighting, without aﬀecting the original
sound and functionality of the timpani.
The initial prototype (ﬁgure 1) was realized in a tat-
tered 21” timpani from the 1960s. After six month of te-
dious experiments with diﬀerent systems for projection and
mallet-tracking we succeeded in putting together a stage-
proof setup that was publicly premiered with the composi-
tion Licht & Hiebe in 2010. In 2011 the Hexenkessel was
shipped to the U.S. as submission to the Margaret Guthman
New Instruments Competition in Atlanta. In this interna-
tional competition for innovative musical instruments the
Hexenkessel was awarded an honorary mention by the jury
which included Sergi Jord` a (Reactable) and John Chown-
ing (FM-Synthesis). Various concert performances followed:
NIME 2011 (Oslo, Norway), ZKM (Karlsruhe, Germany),
Greatest Hits Festival (Hamburg, Germany) and others.

national Computer Music Conference (ICMC 2005) by the
Music Technology Group of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra
in Barcelona. The Reactable is designed as a modular mu-
sic creation and performance system, using tagged physical
objects as haptic input devices. A variety of technologi-
cally similar so called tangible user interfaces appeared in
the following years, documented as open-source projects on
the internet. Most of these multitouch-interfaces are con-
structed as tables with a semi-transparent acrylic surface
and graphical interface elements projected from below. A
camera-based tracking system for ﬁngers and objects allows
interaction with the computer system. In contrast to tra-
ditional touchscreens, the ability to track multiple inputs
simultaneously permits the recognition of complex gestures.

While the enclosures of these multitouch-tables usually do
not deliver any speciﬁc functionality besides housinig their
components, the Hexenkessel’ technology is embedded in a
classic orchestral timpani, extending its artistic potential by
adding the vast possibilities of interactive computer-music.

Sensing mallets and hand-gestures on percussive instru-
ments is not a novel idea: As soon as 1973 Moog intro-
duced the 1130 Drum Controller as input-device for per-
cussive synthesized sound. Various companies sold similar
products in the following decades, usually utilizing force-
sensitive resistors (FSR’s) to measure the velocity of strikes
in order to trigger synthesizers or samples. In modern elec-
tronic drumsets such as Roland’s V-drums, still only the
intensity of the input is captured. Thus, by analysing the
waveform, the input’s distance from the centered sensor can
be estimated, giving information on the strike’s location [1].
But there are alternative approaches: The Radio Drum [2],
built by Bob Boie and furtherly enhanced by Max Mathews,
operates with magnetic coils in the tips of two batons and
an array of antennas in the corners of the rectangular sens-
ing area. The batons’ locations in 3D-space are determined
by the electrical capacitance between coils and antennas. In
contrast, Korg’s original Wavedrum (1994) uses the drum-
head’s acoustic sound to drive physical-models for sound
synthesis. A piezo-electric sensor, located below the drum-
head, picks up vibrations and sonic peak detection is em-
ployed to trigger sounds. Depending on the algorithm used
for sound production, also spectrum-analyses are performed
to feed the physical models for sound synthesis. [1] In 2006
Maki-Patola, H¨am¨al¨ainen & Kanerva presented their Aug-
mented Djembe Drum at NIME. As in the Reactable a
camera-based tracking system determines the position of
hands and ﬁngers to allow expressive interaction (leaving
out the Reactable’s visual component). [6] Sokolovskis &
McPherson [10] describe their method of approximating the
location of drum strikes, by calculating time diﬀerence of ar-
rival (TDOA) between six optical sensors mounted below a
common drumhead.
2. TECHNOLOGY
Diﬀerent ideas and technologies that had been brought up
under the DIY-acronym (Do It Yourself) were adapted for
this project: For example the construction of the tracking
system is based upon approved methods published by the
NUI Group1, originally developed for multitouch-tables. In
contrast to this, the interactive graphical interface was cus-
tom made for this instrument. Here the artistic constraints
are deﬁned, so this software component is comprehended
as part of the particular composition. Besides the concep-

tion and realization of such an interface, the main goal was
the implementation of a reliable hardware setup within the
tight ﬁttings of the timpani’s kettle with maximum cost-
eﬃciency. The original prototype was developed at the ex-
pense of approximately $ 500 (US).

2.1 Projection
For the projection from within the timpani’s kettle a LED-
based projector (Optoma ML-750) was chosen. This projec-
tor oﬀers a very compact size, accompanied with low heat-
emission, which is crucial for the operation considering the
poor air-circulation inside the instrument. For these fea-
tures we accept weak light output (700 ANSI-Lumen) and
fairly low resolution (1280 x 800 pixels) as trade-oﬀ.
To achieve the desired projection-size with the drum-
head’s diameter we developed a custom lens for the ini-
tial prototype and deﬂected the picture twice with mir-
rors. While this led to a suﬃcient screen size, it resulted
in a signiﬁcant loss of light intensity and problems with fo-
cussing. To overcome these issues, for the current setup we
use the projector’s standard lens in combination with a con-
cave mirror (originally intended for fork-lifters). The optical
123
distortion resulting from this setup is digitally eliminated.
While the original design could hardly ﬁt the needed size
of the 21” drumhead, our present setup can easily handle
larger screens, so a bigger scale timpani can be modiﬁed in
the same way. For the new Hexenkessel a 26” instrument
by the Dutch manufacturer Adams was acquired.
2.2 Tracking system
The mallet- and ﬁnger-positions are identiﬁed using a cam-
era, sensitive infrared (IR) light, mounted inside the kettle.
For the illumination, we conducted experiments with var-
ious well documented methods (ﬁgure 2). [8] In the origi-
nal prototype we used the LLP-method (laser light plane),
where IR-lasers with special lenses (line-generators) were
mounted on the timpani to produce a plane of light in
the IR-spectrum (780nm) just above the drumhead. For
the current setup we use IR-LED-strips inside the kettle,
realizing the DI-method (diﬀused illumination). Here not
only the outlines of bodies touching the surface are recog-
nized, but this method also allows detecting special mark-
ers (ﬁducials) attached to objects put on the drumhead, as
demonstrated with the Reactable. This lighting-technique
presents another advantage: The size of the resulting lumi-
nous spot (blob) is dependent on the pressure of the input
on the surface, enabling more dynamic and expressive input
recognition.
For the identiﬁcation of input-gestures the open-source
software Community Core Vision (CCV) is used. CCV
reads and processes the camera’s output: After eliminat-
ing the static background, diﬀerent video-ﬁlters are applied
in order to create distinct light blobs which are interpreted
as touches. The coordinates of these input-events are sent,
coded in TUIO-format [4], to the interpreting application.
The data can be forwarded via network to another computer
or can be further processed locally.
2.3 Interpretation of tracked input data
The tracking-data generated in CCV is received in the visual
programming language Max where all further processing
and interpretation is performed, such as the pre-distortion
of the video-content to counteract the eﬀect of the curved
mirror or the mapping of tracking-coordinates to the corre-
sponding pixel for calibration purposes. The rendering of
interface elements, the implementation of interactive con-
trols and the sound-processing are realized in Max as well.
At this stage the technological and artistic development pro-
cess merge. Since the needs and concepts might be unique to
one particular piece, the implementation of the appropriate
functionality can be considered to be part of the composi-
tion.
Of course, additional sensors can be added to the instru-
ment, as we do it to track the position of the prototype’s
foot pedal utilizing a Sharp distance sensor. Also a DMX-
interface to control stage-lights was integrated in the Hex-
enkessel, so the player can incorporate his own interactive
light-show, making the Hexenkessel a truly versatile inter-
face for interactive media art.
2.4 Shortcomings
Especially for percussive interfaces, latency is a critical is-
sue. The currently used camera for the mallet-tracking op-
erates at 60 frames per second (fps), accordingly the input
is updated every 16.6ms. Adding up the time for processing
and the audio-interface’s latency, the delay sums up to ap-
proximately 25ms. Also the projector introduces additional
latency. But since the graphics are only used as visual feed-
back for the performer, this issue is ignored at this stage of
development. The overall system-latency would be consid-
ered unacceptable for a percussion trigger pad. But in the
Hexenkessel the tangible input is mainly used for setting pa-
rameters of sound synthesis, eﬀects and light control, where
timing is less crucial. For time-critical interaction a micro-
phone can be used, to perform audio-based onset-detection
in order to initialize actions with minimal latency. This was
done in Licht & Hiebefor triggering an electronic basedrum
with a synchronized stroboscopic ﬂash.
Another issue, speciﬁc to the Hexenkessel, is the choice
of the drumhead: Diﬀerent models have unique characteris-
tics, concerning projection quality and translucency of IR-
light. Both requirements are fairly contradictory and need
to be balanced. And if the DI-method is chosen for IR-
illumination reﬂections on the skin’s underside can become
problematic: In contrast to solid surfaces, where the static
background and reﬂections can easily be eliminated by im-
age processing, the vibrating drumhead produces constantly
moving reﬂections that can cause false readings. After the
comparison of numerous diﬀerent models by various brands,
the Remo’s Suede series was chosen as drumhead for the
Hexenkessel.

3. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Thanks to ﬁnancial support from the Hamburg State Min-
istry of Science, Research and Equalization (BWFG) the de-
velopment of the instrument could be resumed in 2014 after
resting for two years as a research project at the Hamburg
University for Music and Theatre (HfMT Hamburg). Vari-
ous components of the prototype that appeared to be prob-
lematic in concert situations were able to be optimized. The
main challenge was to reduce the time span necessary for
setup and the possibility to easily reproduce the instrument
and its parts. This was realized by replacing the double-
124
mirror setup by the concave mirror in conjunction with a
standard projector (ﬁgure 3). And the transition to the
DI-illumination-technique made it possible to discard the
unusual IR-lasers in favor of cheap IR-LED-strips, which
could be permanently mounted inside the kettle.
Also the software was entirely rewritten, using several
new features of recent Max-releases, thus enhancing the
overall system-performance and simplifying the development
of new interfaces. Namely the jit.phys-objects allow the
quick realization of new graphical interfaces. This toolset is
built upon the Bullet physics library, featuring 3D-physics
simulation and collision reportings. Furthermore TUIO-like
touch-messages are accepted as input for interaction.
With the recent development of the ’Hexenkesselchen’ the
technological concept was transferred into a standard 14”
Floor-Tom (ﬁgure 4). All features of the original project
could be retained, while oﬀering a portable, low-cost solu-
tion for every drummer.

4. CONCLUSIONS
Within the three years of the ongoing UMIS project (Uni-
ﬁed Musical Instrument Surfaces) the instrument will be
further optimized and presented in concerts with student
compositions. Also pieces featuring tangible score elements
are in development. In the future the Instrument may even
be used as interactive tool for practicing.
Whether the Hexenkessel’s evolution will ever go beyond
the status of a prototype, ready for small-scale production,
remains to be seen. The target group of experimental tim-
pani players appears too small to go into mass production.
However, the Hexenkesselchen may appeal to a whole new
group of potential users. Meanwhile the use of the Hex-
enkessel in the context of contemporary music and multi-
media performance arts goes on: The updated Hexenkessel
will be premiered on stage at the Sound and Music Com-
puting conference (SMC 2016) in Hamburg.
