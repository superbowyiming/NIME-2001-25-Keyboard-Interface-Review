ABSTRACT
The sustainability of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs)
is a crucial concern within the NIME community, not only
in the design of the instruments but also in terms of sus-
taining the instrument over a prolonged period, promoting
longevity, and minimizing obsolescence. The risk of design-
ing advanced instruments becoming debris quickly is real
if longevity is not actively considered. In this paper, we
present the process of redesigning a crafted DMI to fit a
small-scale production process while considering strategies
that render the final design more sustainable and maximize
the object’s lifespan. We present the results of a critical
analysis of this process through a sustainability lens. From
this analysis, we distilled a number of reflections that could
help similar design processes or NIME crafting activities.
The most innovative reflections are related to inscribing sus-
tainability into the practice of using the instruments. From
this perspective, we suggest considering the future user as a
designer capable of fixing, adjusting, redesigning, or hack-
ing the DMI and actively provide possible solutions that can
significantly extend the lifespan of a DMI and, consequently,
its sustainability.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the last few years, NIME started to pay increasing atten-
tion to sustainability related to building new musical tools
development (e.g., [33, 29, 8]). Parallely, the community
also addressed the longevity of Digital Musical Instruments
(DMIs) (e.g., [36, 7, 31]), which is essential to preserve de-
sign knowledge and transform in practice. These two as-
pects are related, mainly if we focus on DMIs disposals [29].
Indeed, the risk of designing outstanding instruments that
become debris in nothing but a few years is real if we do
not actively consider longevity.
In this paper, we present the process of redesigning a
crafted DMI - the Chowndolo - to fit a small-scale produc-
tive process. During the process, we specifically focused
on strategies that could render the final design sustainable
and maximize the object’s lifespan. Additionally, we en-
deavored to mutate strategies from the Human-Computer
Ineraction (HCI) discourse [24, 4, 2, 9], design justice [6],
and Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) debate
[41, 12].
By retrospectively analyzing our work - using the Reflection-
on-Action methodology [46] - and reading it through the
lenses of sustainability in and through design [24], we dis-
tilled several strategies which could help similar design pro-
cesses or arguably even more traditionally NIME crafting
activities. Some strategies directly relate to the production
process (e.g., rounding the edges, optimizing the production
phases). Furthermore, we develop some reflections on future
uses of the instruments, which we referred to as inscribing
sustainability in the practice . We suggest considering the
user as a future designer capable of fixing, adjusting, and
even redesigning or hacking the DMI. We propose a list of
solutions in support of this approach.
2. BACKGROUND
One of the most relevant issues related to the sustainability
of DMIs is the longevity of musical instruments. For this
reason, the first subsection is dedicated to this topic. After-
ward, we scrutinize ideas that emerged in the Sustainable
Human-Computer Interaction (SusHCI) debate and the dis-
course on Free Software and Open Hardware concerning sus-
tainability.
2.1 Longevity (and Sustainability) of NIMEs
The debate on the longevity of new music technology has
a relatively long life [36, 7, 26]. In 2017, Morreale and col-
leagues surveyed authors of new DMIs presented at NIME
between 2010 and 2014 [36]. Results highlighted that most
of the instruments were used in public performances less
than four times by one or two artists. McPherson suggested
that “design decisions that promote a successful first per-
formance will not necessarily translate to broader uptake”
[40]. To address the problem of longevity and sustainabil-
ity of new DMIs, Marquez-Borbon and Martinez-Avila [26]
supported the need to develop non-traditional pedagogical
systems in support of artistic practices.
The T-Stick, a family of instruments originally presented
at NIME paper in 2007 [23], has been the protagonist of
several research projects developed to prolong its life span.
In 2018, several copies of successive generations of the T-
Sticks were developed to overcome “issues related to the
aging of components, changes in external software, lack of
documentation, and in general, the problem of technical
maintenance” [39]. Additionally, several composition com-
missions were made to expand the community around the
instrument [14]. Finally, Kirby et al. [19] developed the
t-Tree to overcome obsolescence derived from the evolving
changing of protocols and standards [19].
The T-stick represents one of the few examples where
a large number of research projects aimed at keeping one
DMI alive. Other examples include the Feral Cello [7], the
Electrumpet [22], Click::RAND [10], AirStick [51], and AI-
terity [50], which have been updated in accordance to artis-
tic needs derived by the practice or to prevent technical
obsolescence.
All these examples represent attempts to prolong an in-
strument’s lifespan, although some do not directly address
the issue of longevity. However, the vast majority tends to
be used only a few times [36]. Recently, disposal-related is-
sues have been discussed concerning sustainable music tech-
nology design [29, 8].
In line with the studies presented here, we describe an
updated version of a DMI. The novelty of this study is
the explicit focus on sustainable strategies connected to the
longevity of the DMI.
2.2 Sustainability In and Through Design: Ideas
from HCI
Environmental sustainability has been addressed by a sub-
field of HCI which is labeled as Sustainable HCI (SusHCI)
(e.g., [48, 4, 24]). At an early stage of the SusHCI, Ble-
vis’ [4] introduced how digital tools can impact environ-
mental sustainability in two distinctive manners. Mankoff
and colleagues [24] systematized them by proposing the cat-
egories of sustainability in and through design. While sus-
tainability in design addresses reducing the environmental
costs of the design and the components of an artifact, sus-
tainability through design aims at promoting the awaken-
ing of environmentally-friendly practices. This second ap-
proach focuses on “[...] ways of living and processes of social
change.”
More recently, Hansson et al. [16] highlighted how the
SusHCI discourse has primarily focused on individual re-
source consumption (e.g., aiming at decreasing or shifting
individual choices). This through design approach tends to
primarily focus on supporting informed choice or via per-
suasive systems based on strategies such as feedback, vi-
sualization, or gamification. A debate overly focused on
persuasive systems has been openly critiqued by Dourish
[9], who argues that such an approach conceives environ-
mental concerns merely in terms of personal (individualis-
tic) moral choices. In continuity with these considerations,
in the last few years, several authors (e.g., [16, 20, 48, 3,
47]) pointed out the very need of broadening the vision of
sustainability by addressing the social system, supporting
local communities, and social justice. The need to balance
multiple aspects of sustainability also represents the under-
lying principle that grounds the 17 United Nations goals
for sustainable development 1. We align with the need to
consider sustainability from a broad perspective. In line
with the design justice vision [6], we embrace the idea that
open culture can address sustainability in a dimension that
creates a continuity between individual behaviors and cul-
tural change. In this sense, Free/Libre and Open Source
Software (FLOSS) and open hardware can be particularly
relevant. On the one hand, the use of FLOSS is often an
individual choice; on the other hand, FLOSSs are developed
and supported by communities [41].
2.3 FLOSS and Sustainability
Blevis has discussed ten actions, ranging from the greatest
to the least negative environmental impact of the residual
components of a piece of technology, that range from Dis-
posal (when the design causes the disposal of physical or
digital material) to Active repair of misuse (when the de-
sign aims at repairing the harmful effects of unsustainable
use) [4]. Open hardware and free software minimize the risk
of obsolescence and promote interoperability and repairing,
reducing hardware waste.
In the last years, different actors pointed out how free
software and open hardware can facilitate generative up-
cycling and prolong hardware lifespan, with examples rang-
ing from non-profit organizations such as Free Software Foun-
dation Europe 2 to institutional EU reports [12]. The rel-
evance of open solutions concerning sustainability has also
emerged in digital music literature (e.g., [29, 8, 15, 30]).
Free software and open hardware solutions generally focus
on the possibility of replicating [13] or re-using the same
resource in different contexts, with a tendency to collec-
tive (social) contributions to its improvement [12, 21]. This
attitude was established in the free software communities
over multiple decades [41] and more recently spread to other
technologies such as 3D printing and Open Hardware [38,
32]. Focusing on replicating, re-using, and improving sup-
ports prolonging the longevity of the digital tools by sup-
porting re-use and active repair and contrasting obsoles-
cence. Overall open standards and open culture can con-
tribute to the sustainability of a DMI. At the same time, an
1https://sdgs.un.org/
2https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/sustainability
Open Source DMI can promote open culture, fostering and
exposing a sharing and re-using attitude toward technology.
In the rest of this paper, we will analyze several choices we
performed in our project to try to maximize such potential
within the scope of a scalable production.
3. METHODOLOGY
This paper analyzes the design process of the second version
of a digital musical instrument named Chowndolo. This
new version is the result of a collaboration between the
first author (with a background in industrial design who
acted as the main designer in the process described in this
paper—from now on the designer ) and the second author
(with a background in music technology, composition, and
performance, he is the creator of the original instrument
and contacted the first author for redesigning the instru-
ment—from now on the musician ). The overall arc of the
project aims to bring the instrument from the state of an
advanced prototype to a product that can be produced in
small stocks and sold to the public. The research combined
autobiographical and idiographical design approaches (sim-
ilarly to [27, 28]).
The project itself followed an idiographic process [17],
as the redesign was primarily conducted by the first author
(the designer) tailored to the needs of the second author (the
musician), with the core aim to produce on a small-scale,
and increase its sustainability. The focus of the sustainabil-
ity of musical systems was introduced by the first author,
who is developing his Ph.D. thesis on this topic. The re-
flections developed at the end of this paper are, therefore,
primarily derived from the autobiographical account of the
designer on his own practice within the development of the
DMI.
Throughout the entire process, the designer noted the
evolution of the work in a diary, including the main elements
that emerged and the activities developed at each step. A
step could be a discussion with the musician or a design
session in CAD. The entire process lasted six months and
was articulated in 13 steps. The diary served as a basis for
a Reflection-on-action [46], developed by the designer on
its practice. Reflection-on-action is a research activity that
“takes place after the activity and enables the exploration
of what happened and why in order to develop questions,
ideas, and examples about the activities and practices in
focus” [49]. Therefore, the core contribution of this research
is based on an autoethnographic process of the designer [11]
(as it has been adapted to HCI research [42]) that aims
to consider our design choices in relation to sustainability
critically.
To initiate such a reflexivity process, we analyzed the di-
ary using thematic analysis [18, 5]: we inductively coded
(using open coding) the diary and recursively clustered the
codes to identify strategies for a sustainable development of
NIMEs. This analysis identified three main themes, each
composed of several subthemes. At the end of this process,
we realized that the first two themes correspond to the ap-
proaches of sustainability in and through design proposed
by Mankoff [24], thus we renamed them. The third theme,
on the contrary, highlights a novel approach3. This analysis
of the diary, combined observation of the final design and
schematics, served as the basis to propose a set of design
strategies. Before presenting these strategies, we provide an
overview of the entire process and the final design.

the diary are available at https://github.com/

4. THE (RE)DESIGN PROCESS
The original version of the Chowndolo was created by the
second author and has been presented in many venues, in-
cluding IRCAM Forum (Paris), Ars Electronica (Linz), Guild-
hall School of Music & Drama (London), Sonorities Festi-
val (Belfast), NIME 2019 Art Installation (Porto Alegre)
and received an international award: Guthman Musical In-
strument Competition 2022 (3rd prize). The second author
(original author of the DMI) contacted the first author to
adapt the instrument’s design to fit a small-scale produc-
tion. This section describes the process we underwent to
create the design projects and schematics to create a new
version of the Chowndolo, focusing on the design choices
adopted to improve its sustainability and longevity.
4.1 Original Design
The instrument relies on a pendant movement to create
sounds (figure 1. The design consists of four main com-
ponents (visible in figure 2): a base, a magnet attached
to a pendant, a set of magnets placed on the base, and two
Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) that amplify and map move-
ment into sound parameters. To interact with the instru-
ment, the performer places the magnets on the base, thus
inducing the pendant to oscillate. The resulting magnetic
field reacts with the coil and the magnet (using a technol-
ogy presented in [35] and converts the oscillations into an
analog signal, which is afterward mapped into sound.
Figure 1: Isometric axonometry of the initial instrument
The base is made of a metal plate encased in a laser-cut
wooden frame, and the pendant is an arc-shaped structure
of four laser-cut pieces.
The arc structure is attached to the base on the upper
side and to the pendant on the lower. The pendant is made
from a thin iron tube connected to a magnet and a manually
wrapped coil.
The magnets are encased in small wooden laser-cut tiles
that can be assembled in tangram-like compositions. The
magnets are made with laser-cut wood based on the Penrose
Tiling pattern. The polarity of the magnet is marked by the
color of the face of the element, which is hand-painted with
acrylic paint.
The PCBs are a basic squared PCB that works as an
amplifier and are encased in two laser-cut acrylic panels,
also containing the Bela platform. The original design also
included a Bela platform, enclosed in a separate case, re-
ceiving the amplified signal from the PCB. Incoming data
are then used to control the parameters of an FM synth
coded in Pure Data.
Before starting the redesign of the instrument, the second
author shared basic documentation, including pictures and
PDF files containing the laser-cut plans with annotations
on the various design elements.

4.2 Redesign Objective
The goal of the (re)design process was to turn the instru-
ment into a commercially viable product that could be sold
as a Do It Yourself kit. The instrument was then to be
improved without deviating significantly from the original
design. In addition, we focused on the sustainability and
longevity of the project at various levels (this paper pri-
marily accounts for this aspect).
An essential aspect of the design process was that the
instrument could be produced in an accessible space, such
as a maker space, so it could be produced autonomously.
The development process was carried out through a se-
ries of steps, alternating CAD design sessions with meetings
where ideas and feedback were exchanged as the design pro-
gressed.
4.3 The Final Version
The design process of the Chowndolo led to the development
of the complete set of CAD files and schematics to create a
new version of the instrument (figure 3), which does not de-
viate significantly from the original instrument 4. The fun-
damental structure was not changed, but several optimiza-
tions were made to improve its functionality and durability
(figure 4).
The base is still made of a metal plate framed by a laser-
cut wooden frame. However, unlike the original version, the
corners have been rounded to reduce the risk of breakage.
The arc structure remains largely unchanged. We re-
placed the component responsible for creating tension with

Figure 3: Isometric axonometry of the final version
a new version made of two laser-cut “V-shaped” elements
that support a new PCB, designed by Andrew McPherson,
positioned perpendicular to the instrument’s base. Addi-
tionally, the inner side of the two arc elements is now tan-
gent to the base, which improves its overall durability. In
addition, we implemented several improvements: a series
of chamfers that smooth out the previously sharp corners
and make it easier to insert the two elements that keep the
two arcs separated and support the pendant. The pendant
maintains its original form, but it is now held in place by
a string rather than by electrical wires. Additionally, the
hand-wrapped coil has been swapped out for a commercially
available alternative.
The magnets maintained their original form, but we re-
placed the hand painting with a laser engraving process. In
this way, we achieve three advantages 1) we do not need
the painting (reducing the unnecessary materials), 2) we
prevent the risk of paint fading, 3) we cut one phase in the
production process.
The PCB, designed with the collaboration of Andrew McPher-
son, is specifically tailored to this updated version of the
Chowndolo. It features standard connectors such as USBC
for power supply and a mini jack socket for audio output.
Finally, the designer also produced a repository 5 con-
taining all the documentation necessary to reproduce the
device, including 2D drawings, 3D models, PCB diagrams
and schematics, and an instruction manual that illustrates
the assembly of the Chowndolo.
5. SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGIES
Based on, our reflection-on-action process, supported by the
thematic analysis of the diary 6 combined with the observa-
tion of the final design and schematics, we propose here
three main design strategies, each characterized by diverse
points, corresponding to the themes and subthemes identi-
fied in the thematic analysis.

5.1 In Design
5.1.1 Open Standards and Interoperability
Concerning the PCB, common standards have been adopted:
Chowndolo’s embedded amplifier is powered via a USBC
port, and the audio output is a 3mm mini jack. These
decisions were made to ensure the instrument met specific
shared standards, guaranteeing reparability, flexibility, and
ease of use. Additionally, the team decided to include some
publicly available parts, such as the Bela platform and the
ESP32 board in the design of the device to reduce the risk
of technical obsolescence and improve the overall reliabil-
ity of the product as well to expand its potential to IoT
capabilities [45].
5.1.2 Hardware Optimization and Durability
The team aimed to optimize the instrument’s shape while
keeping it similar to the original version. The only changes
in the shapes were focused on: 1) eliminating weak points
that the original shape presented (i.e., reducing the angles);
and 2) optimizing the fabrication process by reducing the
number of materials and components that are needed to
build the instrument (i.e., no screws needed).
5.2 Through Design
We identified only one strategy explicitly related to through
design, which is Exposing the circuits.
During the design process, the musician provided the de-
signer with reference images of PCB art products, such as
the Bare Conductive Touch Board 7. This reference mate-
rial inspired the designer to incorporate a visible PCB into
the design, held in place by three laser-cut ribs that slide
directly into the PCB itself. These ribs are designed with
slits to make it easy for the user to insert them without
needing screws. This solution reduces the number of ma-
terials required to produce the object and makes assembly
much simpler. Furthermore, the visible and fully accessible
PCB contributes to an aesthetic that suggests a conceptual
gradient between a closed object and a hackable product.

touch-board
5.3 Process Based
We proposed process-based as a category that encompasses
aspects from in and through design approach. When the
team designed the new Chowndolo, they anticipated a fu-
ture where users might want to hack or modify the in-
strument, extending the design process and, ultimately, the
durability and longevity of the DMI.
5.3.1 Digital Fabrication
The team decided that the whole Chowndolo should be de-
signed to be fabricated using Fablab or maker space digital
fabrication technologies. In particular, after considering dif-
ferent techniques (i.e., 3D printing), we decided to use only
laser cutting technologies. We decided to use only one tech-
nique to minimize the need for a complex infrastructure to
(re)build the components.
5.3.2 Customizable Circuits
The team decided that the amplifier circuit would be em-
bedded within the instrument and connected to a control
panel that could be customized to the customer’s needs.
This control panel could include a Bela platform-powered
digital synthesizer or an ESP32-powered IoT device that
could live stream the signal produced by the pendant. The
team also considered the possibility of not having a panel
and connecting the amplified movement of the pendant di-
rectly to a modular synthesizer.
5.3.3 Documentation and Repository
As part of the design process outcomes, the designer pro-
duced a repository containing all the documentation neces-
sary to reproduce and/or hack the new design of the Chown-
dolo. The repository contains FreeCAD Standard file for-
mat (.FCStd) files, SVG and PDF, KiCAD and GBR files
of the circuits, and detailed instructions explaining the in-
strument’s assembly process. In parallel with the reposi-
tory mentioned above, the design process was documented
and shared via social networks such as Mastodon, Twit-
ter, and Instagram, showing many work-in-progress pictures
and screenshots.
5.3.4 Open Source
The designer’s first consideration was minimizing early ob-
solescence risk. To achieve this, the team decided to con-
sider a scenario where the design process outcomes would be
open-source, following the business model of companies such
as Arduino and Creality. In line with this principle, the new
design’s development happened through open-source CAD
software.
6. DISCUSSION
In this section, we further discuss our strategies, strength-
ening the connection between our proposal and the debate
on sustainability with the aim of offering a contribution on
the sustainable design of an instrument/interface.
6.1 Traditional Sustainability Strategies
Firstly, we focus on the “ in design ” [24] aspect of the new
instrument: the structure of the instrument minimized the
number of fragile elements (e.g., sharp corners). It opti-
mized the number of materials and fabrication techniques
necessary to make the instrument.
Those strategies are not particularly novel per se, as for
instance, were discussed by Margolin in the late 90’ [25].
Additionally, they resonate with European policies estab-
lished more than ten years ago: the European recycling
code, also known as European Waste Catalog (EWC), es-
tablished by the European Union (EU) in the Waste Frame-
work Directive (2008 - 98 - EC)8; and the European Union’s
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Direc-
tive (2012 - 19 - EU) 9.
However, these strategies are still quite absent in the
NIME discourse. For instance, in a systematic analysis of all
the NIME preceding performed in 2021, Masu et al. identi-
fied only 12 papers since the first edition of the conference
accounts for sustainable instances [29]. With this work, we
offer an example of how these strategies can be implemented
in a NIME design process.
6.2 Designer as User of the Future
In addition to the suggestions discussed above, we propose
to inject sustainability in the future practice of a DMI . To
the end, we propose to consider the designer as the user of
the future, fostering his possibility to repair and update the
system.
The adoption of open standards and open source software,
along with the production of documentation and manu-
als, allows the user to easily and actively engage with re-
designing and re-developing the instrument. This possibil-
ity is further exposed in the PCB design, which is fully
visible, offering the user the chance to easily fix or hack
the circuit, an idea that has been discussed in relation to
sustainability and circuit bending [8]. This characteristic
suggests a circular relation between user and developer,
which is quite known among FLOSS communities [41], that
subverts the traditional approach where user and developer
have two distinct and separated roles. We, therefore, under-
line the importance of the use of open source software and
culture in general that promotes a strategy where a project
is reusable and adaptable to future needs [2].
By taking into consideration these strategies, sustainabil-
ity is not only focused on reducing wasted materials and the
disposal of instruments themselves but also a practice-based
approach that makes a project truly available for the com-
munity, eliminating barriers such as copyright-related costs.
Our reflection here takes into consideration the uniqueness
of the NIME as a community of makers (makers are by def-
inition designers-developers-users), which represents a very
fertile environment to broaden the approach mentioned above.
A recent notable music example is the case of the Bela plat-
form, which starting from a hackable product, relying on an
open approach built a wide community decreasing chances
of early obsolescence [37].
Taking into account the considerations above, we hypoth-
esize that it is possible to advance a design strategy for
sustainability in the use of the instrument itself, a vision
that involves not only a single user but a whole commu-
nity. This perspective resonates with Dourish’s open cri-
tique on product-based sustainable strategies, which accord-
ing to the author, is an expression of neoliberal thinking and
tends to conceive environmental concerns merely in terms
of personal (individualistic) moral choices [9]. The strategy
envisioned by the research team rather embraces a social
and community vision, which considers accessibility as a
8https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/glossary/
eea-glossary/european-waste-catalogue-1
9https://environment.ec.europa.
eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/
waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-weee_en
necessary asset to promote sustainability, as recently sug-
gested in the design justice framework [6]. We argue to
avoid inaccessible circuits and components so that the in-
strument is easily hackable and fixable, rather to promote
practices such as circuit bending[8] and critical making [43]
.
This perspective opens a deeper and more important point
to discuss: approaching the user not as a passive actor of the
design object, but as an active human who can partake in fu-
ture re-design and active appropriations of the instrument .
The approach adopted can be labeled as Designer as user
of the future: when designing an interface, the designer em-
pathizes with its user and provides all the means to hack
and/or redesign the outcome of the design process. This ap-
proach is based on a non-task-oriented approach [44], sub-
verting the classic vision of the user [1].
Masu et al. [29] highlighted how the issue of disposal is
a critical aspect of NIMEs sustainability. The authors pro-
posed a model in which disposal is considered at the end
of the process of making, testing, using , and disposing. By
considering the designer as a user of the future, we pro-
mote the idea of (re)making-using loops that can postpone
a disposing phase.
This approach resonates with recent European actions
such as the Indice de r´ eparabilit´ e (reparation index10) in-
troduced as a mandatory element in France in 2021, and
could possibly be extended to other counties in the future;
or the right to repair claiming for the right to repair elec-
tronic devices easily started out in 2019 11.
6.3 Redesign and Longevity
A final consideration in relation to sustainability can emerge
by looking at the core aim of the project: redesigning a
prototype into a small-scale production. Many DMIs pro-
totypes are designed only for the NIME conference or are
tailored for a specific goal so that their life is more likely to
go beyond the experimentation phase [7].
In this sense, the work presented here is aligned to the
many examples that propose an updated version of a NIME
described in section 2.1 (e.g. [10, 51, 50])
The case observed suggests how the life of a prototype
can be extended and transformed into a longer-term salable
instrument. In such a case, also the waste produced dur-
ing the initial trial and error phase required to produce a
prototype is amortized by a longer use of the project.
6.4 Limitation
This work describes the entire design project that led to
building the complete schematics of the new version of the
Chowndolo that can be produced in a small stack. However,
the production phase is still to be fully developed. In the
future, we will test the strategies we proposed here by ana-
lyzing the case of production. We also hope to get feedback
from musicians who will be interested in remaking or hack

7. CONCLUSION
Overall our research contributes to the NIME debate on
sustainable practice by proposing to consider strategies that
can prolong the life of a NIME, both in terms of material
and in terms of practice. With the rhetoric suggestion to
‘consider designers as users of the future’, we aim at inscrib-
ing sustainability into practice.

11https://repair.eu/about/
Some in design strategies include the production of manu-
als, adoption of open standards, open sourcing of hardware,
and using FLOSS CAD tools, which are all crucial elements
of the design process.
Furthermore, in line with the documentation guidelines of
the NIME community 12, our approach also encourages the
active participation of the users in the (re)design process,
facilitating loops between using and future re-makings such
as the integration of the instrument into an IoMusT [52]
system, which is crucial to ensure long-term sustainability
of NIMEs.
All these elements together render our suggestion a com-
prehensive and effective approach towards sustainable in-
strument design. The work presented in this paper has po-
tential for further development by the proposed strategies
to the wide range of projects within the NIME community.
The strategies proposed here are grounded in a long-lasting
debate from other areas, such as HCI [24, 4, 2] and FLOSS
[41], and policies. However, we call for further research
given that sustainability is relatively new as a topic within
the NIME debate.
