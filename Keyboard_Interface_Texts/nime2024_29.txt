ABSTRACT
This paper outlines an interspecies improvised musical col-
laboration with Razzly the dog that utilises a pre-existing
gestural DMI, the AirSticks, inside a fetch ball. The evolu-
tion of the collaboration across three significantly different
performances over a year and across two cities is described,
along with an outline of the mappings created. Through
the lens of my experience as an improviser, instrument de-
signer and dog guardian, and drawing from research into
dog cognition, animal liberation, human-animal interaction,
animal-computer interaction, zo¨omusicology and posthuman-
ism, I explore the phenomena that is dog-human play, and
draw comparisons between it and collaborative musical im-
provisation. Through the act of turning play into a musical
performance, I discuss creativity, agency and consent, focus-
ing on the social, collaborative and physical aspects of mu-
sicking, as opposed to the sound making itself, in an attempt
to understand the way dogs (starting with this particular
dog) might use play, ritual and perhaps even music-making,
to navigate the world and connect with humans.

1. INTRODUCTION
As I sit down to write this paper, I notice Razzly, my al-
most 4 year-old Koolpoodle,1 looking at me from his curled
up position in the corner of the room post-walk. I feel he
is often confused by what I’m doing on the laptop. What
a strange posture, hunched over this perfectly sleek ‘non-
biteable’ object, moving my fingers on it’s flat hard surface,

making clicks and taps and the occasional sigh of frustra-
tion at not finding the right words. Upon hearing a sigh,
Raz, as he is often referred to, or Razzle, Razzle Dazzle,
Razzamatazz (he responds to all) would walk over, sit lean-
ing against my leg and comfort me, noticing some sort of
distress, and suggest, “wanna have a play?”
In this paper I will discuss the interspecies improvised
musical collaboration with Raz that developed through our
plays. The evolution of the collaboration, across three sig-
nificantly different performances over a year and across two
cities will be described, along with the mapping decisions
made in utilising a pre-existing gestural DMI inside a fetch
ball. Through the lens of my experience as an improviser
and instrument designer, and drawing from research into
dog cognition, animal liberation, human-animal interaction,
animal-computer interaction, zo¨omusicology and posthuman-
ism, I wish to explore the phenomena that is dog-human
play, and draw comparisons between it and collaborative
musical improvisation. In the spirit of John Blacking’s 1973
How Musical Is Man?, this is not a scholarly study of canine
musicality, so much as an attempt to reconcile my experi-
ences of interspecies improvisation [4].

mance.
As leading zo ¨omusicologist and composer Hollis Taylor
suggests, in this field of research, where science meets the
arts, we must “deal with generalities and replication... and
incline towards particularities and one-offs” [29]. With this
in mind, I will reference previous research on dog cognition,
musicality and play, but focus on describing in words (and
short videos) the unique experience of working towards and
playing these particular gigs, with this particular instru-
ment, with this particular dog we call Razzly.
Dog cognition researcher and author Alexandra Horowitz
suggests that “naming makes something someone: it per-
sonalizes them” [16]. “To give an animal a name highlights
the differences between subjects (individuals) being consid-
ered only as members of a group (species)” [17]. Horowitz
emphasises that dogs are individuals, each with different
talents, but all with incredible facility for cooperative com-
munication, reading intention and solving the types of prob-
lems that involve humans [15]. She urges more dog guardians
(my preferred word to masters, owners or parents) to let
dogs be dogs and for researchers to investigate their own
dog’s behaviour at home [17], where play can be studied in
a safe yet varied and cognitively challenging environment
[28].
I take this as permission to lean into my experience of col-
laborating with Razzly, and describe him as a collaborator
in detail, as I would any human collaborator. This per-
sonalisation (or ‘caninalisation2’) may help us gain a better
understanding of dog’s relationship with music, play and
cognition (or “dognition” [14]), and of our human selves, as
“our understanding of the human depends on our concep-
tions of [nonhuman] animals” [23].
But my drive to share this story of our creative collab-
oration goes far beyond simply gathering more knowledge
about ourselves as humans. Dogs and humans are, as pio-
neering ecofeminist and posthumanist Donna Haraway states
in her second posthumanist Manifesto,3 “constitutively, com-
panion species”[13]. “Her [Haraway’s] investigations around
interspecies communication and collaboration are realized
specifically through terms of performance as she and her
dog, Cayenne Pepper, work together to produce a success-
ful event” [6], in her case, dog agility shows. Haraway states
in her Companion Species Manifesto that the book“is a per-
sonal document, a scholarly foray into too many half known
territories, a political act of hope in a world on the edge of
global war, and a work permanently in progress, in princi-
ple”[13]. In the spirit of her work, and perhaps as a political
act, I have included Razzly as a co-author here.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Interspecies Musical Improvisation
Interspecies musical collaborators Hollis Taylor [29] and David
Rothenberg [24] have improvised and composed highly evoca-
tive and complex music with birds4 and whales5 respectively
for decades, mimicking and reacting to their non-human col-
laborators in inspired powerful interspecific performances.
Rothenberg compares cross-cultural improvisation—where
collaborators may not speak the same language—with in-
terspecies improvisation, where “spontaneous creativity in
music can dare to make the leap between one animal and
another” [24]. Furthermore, he remarks that “interspecies
improvisation may be a promising way to communicate with
creatures with whom we cannot speak” [24]. Rothenberg’s
focus, like most “interspecies musicians,” is on sonic “intra-
actions” or a “dynamism of forces” [2] with non-human ani-
mals, whose natural song has inspired composers and philoso-
phers for millennia [10].
Though ‘singing’ dogs are not usually considered in this
category of animal ‘muses,’ studies show that dogs are highly-
developed in discriminating between different pitches [1],
with there being no shortage of videos on YouTube of dogs
holding notes.6 Furthermore, the effect of listening to mu-
2my made up term in the spirit of many new dog specific
terms in the field

‘The Companion Species Manifesto’ (2003)

sic on dogs is “quite mixed” [27]. In this paper, it is not
Razzly’s listening or vocal talents that I am interested in
sharing, but his passion for and creativity during play.
2.2 Dog Play as a Dance
Dogs, indeed, are a unique species through which to ex-
amine play [28]. And furthermore, dog play can easily be
viewed through the creative practice lens of dance [16, 20].
Indeed researchers such as Shapiro, in studying the phys-
ical behaviour of their own dogs, note that “for [his dog]
Sabaka, meaning consists of and is known through bodily
experience. To understand the complex, intimate, and won-
derful choreographies7 of that [dog] world, it is helpful for
an investigator to assume a posture of bodily sensitivity to
it—to kinesthetically empathize” [25]. Considering dogs are
clearly more wired for physical play or ‘dancing’ than util-
ising their vocal chords and lips, many researchers focus on
bodily communication as an inspiration for interspecies col-
laboration [7]. Building on Shapiro’s “kinesthetic empathy”
[25], Warkentin developed a “praxis of attentiveness” [32] in
connecting physically with animals. “The kind of attentive-
ness we are concerned with here involves one’s whole bodily
comportment and a recognition that embodiment is always
in relation to social others, both animal and human” [32].
In playing with Raz, this attention to my body ‘language,’
along with an acute attention to the space around us, is
key to our collaborative play—“the task is to create the
space within which a response can emerge or an exchange
co-evolve” [5]. This nonhuman turn—allowing animals to
‘have their say’—is a practice that has recently been in-
creasingly adopted in human-animal interaction design, as
participatory design practices are more regularly deployed
in the field [8].
In the field of creative improvisation, whether music or
dance, these concepts of turn taking, attentiveness and pro-
viding space are key in any truly successful collaboration.
Noticing that these and other elements of musical impro-
visation were inherent in my plays with Raz, and having a
pre-existing gestural DMI, the AirSticks, lying around the
house, was always going to lead to some play-turn-dance-
turn-sonic intra-actions.
2.3 The AirSticks
The AirSticks have been documented in previous NIME
Proceedings [30], so I will keep a technical description to
a minimum here. The version of the device used with Raz
is what we refer to as the AirSticks Box—a wireless device
the size of fun-size Mars bar that can be worn or placed
in objects, like a fetch toy. 8 The device connects via Blue-
tooth to a laptop running our receiver app, which translates
the gestural data, in the form of linear acceleration and ab-
solute orientation, into useful OSC and MIDI information.
For our performances, I created mappings in Ableton Live 9
which I will elaborate on later in the paper.
2.4 Animal Computer Interaction
Since interaction designer Clara Mancini wrote her Animal-
Computer Interaction Manifesto in 2011, calling for the fos-
tering of the “relationship between humans and animals by
enabling communication and promoting understanding be-
tween them [through] technology that allows companion an-
imals to play entertaining games with their guardians or
7my emphasis

enables guardians to understand and respond to the emo-
tions of their companion animals”[19], very little work has
been done in the field of creative or musical animal com-
puter interaction. Exceptions to this may be the design of
digital musical instruments for grey parrots [11], or some
dogs hijacking iPad games.10 11
The Global Pet Toys Market, of which dogs make up al-
most half, reached eight billion US dollars in 2022, and is
expected to hit thirteen billion US dollars by 2030,12 with a
growing number of tech toys hitting the market, some util-
ising cameras or other sensors to maintain attention during
self-play.13

3. AN INTERSPECIES COLLABORATION
3.1 Who Is Raz The Dog?
I’ll try to keep this short, but like most dog guardians, I
could write for days about this special little guy, particularly
as he entered my life as a puppy in the height of lockdown
in Melbourne, Australia. I never had a dog growing up.
This gave me a child-like fascination with this tiny creature.
Also, being a single non-parent musician, with no tours for
the foreseeable future, it gave me a type of responsibility
I had never encountered before, and someone to focus on,
someone who could give me structure. Someone to try to
understand. Most of that understanding has come out of
play and long off-leash walks.
On these walks, Raz balances seeking guidance with ex-
ploring his spatial freedom with aplomb. He has a keen road
sense, so feels comfortable walking well ahead, turning back
to me within each block to make sure he is leading us in
the right direction. On bush walks, he identifies the most
unclear of paths. On slow walks he rarely heals, but on bike
rides, he runs alongside like a champion, excited that I’ve
finally picked up the pace to his liking.
When we wrestle at home he vocalises, and play bites with
confidence and gentleness. If he wants to play rougher, he
goes grabs his rope, which is as old as he is, showing his
dedication and care to the game of tug and the tools we use

in play. He’s hard to beat, but doesn’t matter how razzed
up he gets with his head banging and paw stomping he is
lighting fast to let go of the rope on the slightest utterance
of ‘out!’
He loves to fetch. The rope, a ball, a frisbee, a big stick.
If we are near water, he beckons for it to be thrown in,
and then cautiously navigates his way in if he hasn’t been
in before. But once the depth has been assessed, months
later he will remember the best way in. He loves the rock
pools, and the sand, and has developed a game of self-fetch,
dropping the ball and watching the tide take it back out,
or digging a hole from which to launch the ball backwards
between his legs.
And he loves to catch. A ball, a frisbee, and treats. The
tiniest treats from metres away. Once the ball is in his
mouth he chews gently, drops it, and catches it again off
the first bounce. But of most interest is where he drops it.
Playing a game of fetch with Raz often feels like I might be
the one doing the fetching. Sure with some command like
‘closer?’ he may bring it to me, but he navigates spaces and
social relations through where and when he drops the ball.
In certain moods he insists on dropping the ball to other dog
lovers at the park, kids in particular. At the times where
his focus is on us really playing the game, his choice for
dropping the ball can communicate joy, fatigue or humour.
He can also chill though, laying his head against the sound
board of an upright piano when Chopin is being played or
just hanging under the table at the bar when a band is
on, waiting for some food to drop. His relaxed and curious
demeanor around all people — and cats, and most dogs —
and his appetite for play, inspired us to combine his love for
fetch, with my love for improvised music.
3.2 A New Instrument?
During the development of the latest AirSticks, the team
at SensiLab began gravitating towards making mappings
that centred around the absolute linear acceleration of the
device, creating instruments I’ve affectionately started re-
ferring to as ‘glorified shakers.’ The ‘Energy’ parameter (as
the team refers to it) can be adjusted to bring immediate
sonic response, with the dynamics also controlled by this
parameter. It can also be quantised to a pulse. The abso-
lute orientation can then be mapped to change filters, pitch
and effects.
While exploring an FM synthesis mapping in my living
room during lockdown, wearing the AirSticks on my wrists,
Raz came over to me with his old rope for a play.
‘Rope Play’
https://youtu.be/9vpwE587ziI
As enjoyable as it was to sonify or ‘musify’ [18, 33] this
play, half considering what sounds I could make and half
focusing on playing tug, it didn’t really feel like Raz had
much control or agency over the sound, with the devices
strapped on me and not him.
For the next sonic play, leading up to an upcoming perfor-
mance I had committed us to do in SensiLab post-lockdown,
I decided that perhaps Raz should wear the device. After
trying his tail and collar, I settled on strapping the device
to his front leg.
‘AirStick on Front Leg Play’
https://youtube.com/shorts/y7DguEzh88Y
This brought up some concerns about consent, with Raz
not being able to stop making sounds unless he stopped
moving. Though I was reluctant to put our 3D printed
custom-electronics device in a dog toy and have people throw
it around a room and Raz chew on it, not a single device
has been harmed since squeezing one into a dog fetch ball
almost 2 years ago. This new design gave Raz more agency
over how long to engage with what we may call a new in-
strument, perhaps?
‘AirStick in Ball Play’

With this set up I felt ready to properly collaborate with
Raz on our first upcoming performance at our lab’s open
day.
Figure 3: Ending of Our Premiere Performance.
3.3 The Gigs
3.3.1 The Lab
I took months to prepare for this first gig, feeling concerned
that the performance would appear like a gimmick or worse,
dog exploitation. I wanted people to get an idea of who Raz
was, for Raz to feel like we were working together on some-
thing special, and to feel like Raz was contributing, or more
so, just being himself, with me avoiding the use of vocal
commands.
‘Except From The Lab Show’
https://youtu.be/-zP8t-Kj0a8
I decided to film all our ‘rehearsals’ and to present them as
a rolling ‘triptych’ before, during and after the performance
(see The Lab Show link above). These rehearsals included
walks, plays, wrestles, car drives, naps and a groom (Raz got
one of his full back mohawk haircuts for the gig). Feeding
the audio from the film into the AirSticks, I decided to
start the piece by manipulating the audio through the ball’s
movement, while enticing Raz to play a gentle tug game
with it. I automated Ableton to cross-fade different sounds
and parameters within the 12min play—basically changing
the way the ball would react to movements over the course
of the piece. In the performance, as I began hearing less
of the film audio manipulation and started hearing that the
ball was now activating a marimba sound, I finally threw the
ball to Raz, allowing him to take charge of the instrument.
The game in the piece for me was to then pull out two other
AirSticks balls with different sounds and give Raz a choice
of which one to play, based on its sound, or probably more
so its ‘feel.’ All three balls, of different sizes, shapes and
materials, were automated to change the way they reacted
over the course of the piece, but always worked with the
other sounds—one percussive, one melodic and one playing
lower registers. As the crowd began to film the performance
for social media, Raz began to invite others in the semi-
circle which had formed around us to get involved in the
game, gesturing for audience members to throw the ball as
he dropped it at their feet. Compositionally building to a
drum’n’bass chaotic section and then cross-fading back to
the audio from the film still playing behind us, I gestured
for Raz to join me back on the couch to finish the piece.
Figure 4: Raz at the Melbourne gig
3.3.2 The Improvised Music Night in Melbourne
For the next show I wanted to play drums, for Raz to move
more freely around the space, and for the sounds to be
purely made up of live real-time sampling, looping and ma-
nipulation of the acoustic kit. Having played at this partic-
ular improvised music night many times before, I knew the
audience would be open-minded and that the space would
allow Raz to interact more easily with the audience, partic-
ularly with me being ‘stuck’ behind the drum-kit. What
worked further in our favour was the audience’s natural
inclination to sit on the floor in a semi-circle around the
drums (see The Improvised Gig in Melbourne link below).
The piece began by inviting Raz to sit next to the drum-kit
by squeezing a ‘acoustic’ squeaky dog toy and luring him
to play tug with it, while improvising with the other hand
and feet. After sampling the squeak, we then moved onto
playing with the AirSticks ball. As soon as Raz had full
control of this new ball in his mouth, he was off into the
crowd which freed me up to improvise on the drums, occa-
sionally resampling new percussive activity through loops
and granular synthesis controlled via hotkeys in Ableton.
‘Excerpts from The Improvised Gig in Melbourne ’
https://youtu.be/JZWxVud4l8A
Raz seemed to love this set up, strutting proudly around
the room, choosing different people to drop the ball to, most
of who got a chance to improvise a phrase or two with the
ball in hand before throwing it back towards Raz. As we
started looking for a way to end the piece, I noticed an
audience member winding up for a high throw. As Raz
leapt up I decided it would a fitting ending, marking the
catch with a bass drum hit and muting Ableton.
3.3.3 The Improvised Music Night in Sydney
For the last show I’ll outline here, I wanted to play a 35min
drum composition while wearing AirSticks (under gloves
on the back of the hand so that all wrist movement was
tracked), for Raz to play a ‘melodic’ part freely in the au-
dience and for me to interact with his sonic part, not his
physical self. Like the previous gig, I knew I would have an
open-minded audience, with the organisers personally invit-
ing me to perform with Raz.
‘Excerpts from The Improvised Gig in Sydney’
https://youtu.be/G5k9P4mPluc
Figure 5: Raz at the Sydney gig
The space was much bigger than any we’d played in be-
fore, with the audience seated in chairs and comfortable
couches (see The Improvised Gig In Sydney link above).
The piece began with a standing AirSticks solo beside the
kit, rolling Raz’s AirStick toy ball with my feet. I had pro-
grammed the sound of the worn AirSticks to cross-fade with
AirStick ball, as if the sound was being transferred from me
to him. As soon as the cross-fade was complete, I kicked the
ball and Raz went into the audience among the chairs, acti-
vating sounds that would change and ‘work’ with whatever
I was doing with the worn AirSticks and drums. For one
section, I programmed howling sounds to activate if the ball
was left alone for more then 10 secs, for another, samples
I had recorded of Raz barking and vocalising while play-
ing layered with orchestral percussion hits, and for another,
bass-lines synchronised to the tempo of my worn AirSticks.
I basically didn’t see Raz for most of the piece, just hearing
the intensity with which he was playing amongst the audi-
ence. I mapped out the ending in a way that would allow
me to play the AirSticks for the last few minutes without
drums, giving me a way to get off the kit and go summon
Raz back to near the drums for the ending.
4. DISCUSSION
The interspecies musical collaboration laid out in this pa-
per clearly sits apart from those created by other ‘acoustic’
interspecies musicians mentioned earlier [29, 24]. Raz’s in-
volvement in this more-than-human sonic collaboration, “as
the anthropocentric ‘othering’ of non-humans gives way to
a concept of a more-than-human sociality of sound” [31], is
not sonic itself, but instead his ‘natural’ play is merely soni-
fied (through the use of motion sensing technology). “Bod-
ies are at the core of our experience, we live our lives as
embodied creatures—feeling, sensing, thinking, and acting
through the body—and our relationship to space, place,
landscape and others is inescapably shaped by the kinds
of bodies we have” [9]. Raz uses fetch toys to navigate
space and relations with others. He uses these ‘toys,’ like
we use musical instruments, to express himself in every-
day life (and now in concerts), making choices based on his
mood and preferences. The latest ball found at the park
is often the go to, but he returns to certain ones that lie
around the house at his discretion. 14 It was truly fasci-
nating to see him often beckoning for the AirSticks ball at
home, which I would place up high to avoid being played
with outside our rehearsals, in an attempt to reduce the
risk of it being damaged. Occasionally he would take it out
of my bag if I was too complacent in hiding it and invite
play. There was a ritualistic association with the AirSticks
ball that usurped the sound it could make—sound coming
out of speakers spatially displaced from the physical action.
Indeed many humans would pick up the AirSticks in work-
shops or demonstrations and struggle with this disembod-
ied sound phenomenon, so it would be tough to expect a
dog to understand the connection between their movement
and the music coming out of the speakers. But the ritual,
the ceremony, the social gathering, the attention, the focus
given to this particular object in a place where people con-
gregated is something he definitely seemed to understand,
perhaps? And as Haraway reflects on her adventures with
her dog, Cayenne Pepper, “we are training each other in
acts of communication we barely understand” [13].
Outside of better understanding one another, “play can
improve welfare through self-reward, positive experiences,
or social bonding... as evidence from interspecific interac-
tions with humans suggests play increases familiarity, strength-
ens their relationship and may reduce agonistic interactions”
[28]. Further, in a lab experiment, “when a dog and their
handler were ‘Playing’ [sic] with a tug toy, cortisol [stress
14Raz was actually given a found fetch ball by bar person
after one of our gigs which became his favourite for the
week.
levels] increased if this interaction was accompanied by com-
mands, but decreased when play was more spontaneous”
[28]. The choice to avoid using commands, particularly ver-
bal ones that may influence the sonic output of the perfor-
mance, seems to be supported by dog psychology research,
but again, simply leans into the idea of letting dogs be dogs
[17], or more generally, letting beings be beings.
These ‘inclusive’ and ‘empathetic’ decisions are easy to
make within the context of musical improvisation, as the
art-form is grounded in collaborative practices [3], with the
principles in a true collaboration representing complemen-
tary domains of expertise [21]. The dog’s expertise, in this
case Raz’s individual ability to catch, dance and interact
with strangers in a ritualistic performance space, ought to
be celebrated and foregrounded in human-animal interac-
tion research [17]. Furthermore, as Haraway (2008) de-
scribes, only the physical act of play can “lure its apprentice
stoics of both species back into the open of a vivid sensory
present... so that both can learn the corporeal semiosis of
cross-species trust and enter the open of risking something
new” [12].
It is this trust and risk I wanted to share with others
through performance. Playing is something Raz and I do
most days, but the AirSticks ball and the sound it can gen-
erate turns our playing into an act of musicking [26], and
an excuse to share it with an audience.
5. CONCLUSION
In this project, I used the AirSticks as a tool to bring
the more-than-human into our sacred human performance
spaces. In this paper, I used the project as a philosophical
tool for exploring the notions of dog cognition, creativity,
agency and consent. With humans causing more and more
problems for ourselves, and worse, for non-humans and the
entire planet we all share, this paper is an opportunity to
celebrate a non-human animal, in this case Razzly the dog,
and the phenomena that were his first three gigs on his
AirSticks ball of many to come.

7. ETHICAL STANDARDS
In line with the NIME’s Principles and Code of Practice in
Studies and Interfaces Involving Animals, this ‘study’ not
only satisfied all the ethical requirements for the research,
but in fact encouraged best practices in involving animals.
I use ‘study’ in quotation marks as these performances were
never considered as experiments or formalised research. The
intention of these performances and the rehearsals and de-
velopment leading up to them, were always treated as a
form of bounding and an extension of our daily interac-
tion in the form of walks, pats, wrestles and plays. As an
improvising musician and instrument designer, our public
performances grew out of our play sessions at home. As a
practice-based researcher, the description and reflections on
the development and realisation of these plays into musical
performances is something that is hopefully of interest to
the NIME community.
Having brought Raz into my life and home when he was
7-weeks old over three years ago, I have an “intimate knowl-
edge of the specific animal to be included in the study” [22].
As the guardian, I have provided prior consent before pur-
suing this practice-based ‘study’ [22]. Moreover, not only
have I avoided preventing Raz from expressing spontaneous
behaviour, I’ve encouraged it throughout our rehearsals and
performances, using only positive forms of interactions both
in playing and performing with him, but also in our general
day to day. Raz does not show any signs of distress in music
venues and gravitates towards the acoustic piano or drums
when I practice at home. Volume of sound at rehearsals and
performances is kept to a minimum, with again, no sign of
distress from Raz. On one occasion a decision was made to
take Raz away from the venue for a support act that was
louder than anticipated. I have continued to “promote good
quality of life for the animal after the animal’s involvement
in the research” [22].
