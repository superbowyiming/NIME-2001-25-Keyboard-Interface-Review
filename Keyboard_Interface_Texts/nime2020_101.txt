ABSTRACT
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beneﬁcial for patients
who are suﬀering from motor disabilities because it oﬀers
them a way of creative expression, which improves men-
tal well-being. BCIs aim to establish a direct communica-
tion medium between the brain and the computer. There-
fore, unlike conventional musical interfaces, it does not re-
quire muscular power. This paper explores the potential
of building sound synthesisers with BCIs that are based on
steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). It inves-
tigates novel ways to enable patients with motor disabili-
ties to express themselves. It presents a new concept called
sonic expression, that is to express oneself purely by the syn-
thesis of sound. It introduces new layouts and designs for
BCI-based sound synthesisers and the limitations of these
interfaces are discussed. An evaluation of diﬀerent sound
synthesis techniques is conducted to ﬁnd an appropriate
one for such systems. Synthesis techniques are evaluated
and compared based on a framework governed bysonic ex-
pression.

1. INTRODUCTION
Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems aim to provide a
communication medium that is independent of muscular
control. It is helpful for patients with locked-in syndrome,
that is the loss of all or most motor abilities, which is
caused due to diseases like stroke, spinal cord injury, or
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). For such individuals,
BCI systems initially enabled the control of wheelchairs,
prosthetic limbs, and basic communication [25]. Computer
Music has been incorporating methodologies from neural
science to develop brain-computer music interface (BCMI)
systems. Some of the early works that involve BCI and mu-
sic are— Alvin Lucier composed a musical piece by sonifying

electroencephalogram (EEG) in 1965 [20], [32] used EEG to
control electronic sound synthesisers, and [29] carried out
several experiments in using brain waves as high-level input
structures for music. BCMI systems can be classiﬁed into
four categories:audiﬁcation, soniﬁcation , musiﬁcation, and
control. Audiﬁcation is to realise an acoustic representation
of the EEG data. This technique is generally noisy as brain
wave frequencies and audio frequencies belong to diﬀerent
ranges.Soniﬁcation translates EEG data into sound by us-
ing a mapping procedure. This could be used for musical
and non-musical purposes. One such application is spectral
mapping, which is the translation of EEG data into au-
dio frequencies. [14] soniﬁed EEG information by observing
the subject in diﬀerent scenarios. This approach faces the
problem of data being highly inﬂuenced by the environment
and not the subject. Hence, BCI-users will not be able to
communicate eﬃciently with such systems.Musiﬁcation is
the mapping of EEG information into musical parameters.
This includes the translation to musical pitches or rhythms.
This is not of much relevance to this paper as it focuses more
on composition and performance instead of the spectral as-
pects of sound.Control gives the user the ability to make
choices. [16] presented parametric orchestral soniﬁcation
of EEG in real-time (POSER), the system in which mul-
tiple frequency bands are mapped to diﬀerent instruments
of a MIDI device. [13] discusses the development of a P300
composer, scale player, P300 DJ, and P300 algorithmic im-
proviser. Therefore, these demonstrated the potential of
building musical systems that incorporate BCIs.
Software synthesisers, in present times, use graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) to enable musicians to design signal ﬂowcharts .
Virtual studio instruments use intuitive GUI components
like knobs, faders, text boxes, and buttons. Therefore,
the user has a diverse number of parameters that are ad-
justable. BCIs are relatively new and face several limita-
tions. They are not as versatile as conventional GUI in-
terfaces. They have low information transfer rates (ITRs),
that is the amount of data that can be communicated from
the user to the system. In recent years, a method called
steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) has been of
escalating interest to researchers in the community of Neu-
ral Science, Computer Music, Animation, and Virtual Real-
ity. This technique displays multiple regions (also referred
to as targets) on the screen with each region ﬂashing at a
unique frequency and phase. These regions trigger unique
patterns in brain waves that are detected by analysing EEG
data. [3] developed an SSVEP-based BCI and obtained an
ITR of less than 1 bit per second. [5] achieved an ITR of
approximately 5.32 bits per second. Research to improve
BCIs is consistently being conducted in many labs and new
approaches towards analysing EEG data are regularly be-
ing proposed. Therefore, the ﬁrst objective of this paper
is to understand the present sophistication of BCI systems

and evaluate general sound synthesis techniques that can
be adopted by BCI-based synthesisers.
The second motivation of this paper is to ﬁnd novel ways
for such patients to express themselves. This paper proposes
the concept ofsonic expression , that is to express oneself
purely by the synthesis of sound. On the surface, this might
seem ambiguous due to the lack of form and structure, un-
like musical expression. However, patients who have lost
motor abilities for a prolonged period of time may realise
the need for new and unconventional ways of expressing
themselves.
BCMIs are beneﬁcial for such patients because they pro-
vide a novel way of creative expression, which facilitates
positive mental well-being [19]. Studies have developed be-
spoke systems to allow such individuals to experience the
realm of music technology. [23] presented an SSVEP-based
musical system that enabled a locked-in syndrome patient to
control parameters to generate melodies.Activating Mem-
ory was a composition by Eduardo Miranda for four mu-
sicians (a string quartet) that played the musical choices
made by four BCMI-users [11]. This improved the partici-
pation of BCMI-users because they could interact with each
other. The BCMI literature has explored many pathways
for musical expression, but not with directly synthesising
sound.
Common aims of sound synthesis include creating or recre-
ating sounds that are produced by known sound sources,
have similarities with known sources, have no direct associ-
ation with the source but still share certain characteristics,
and noise where frequencies may have statistical relations
with each other [27]. The objective of a BCI-based synthe-
siser hypothesised in this paper is diﬀerent. The interface
is not expected to ﬁnd immediate use for computer music
practitioners or experienced sound designers. It solely ex-
amines the prospects of sonic expression for patients with
locked-in syndrome.
2. BCI-BASED SOUND SYNTHESISER
Three primary aspects of any sound synthesiser are the sig-
nal ﬂowchart, unit generators, and signal processing objects.
A signal ﬂowchart presents a one-to-one relation between
the input and output of the synthesiser. The purpose of
signal ﬂowcharts is to provide a high-level overview of the
functions carried out by the synthesiser. Considering the
present limitations of BCI systems, providing a GUI to cus-
tomise signal ﬂowcharts is not practical. Unit generators are
the fundamental components for sound synthesis. These can
be either signal generators like oscillators or signal modiﬁers
like ﬁlters.
[5] presented an SSVEP-based BCI speller. It has 40 tar-
gets with alphanumeric, punctuation, and navigation com-
mands (similar to a virtual keyboard) that enable a user
to enter text. A similar SSVEP-based interface for a unit
generator is designed in ﬁgure 1. The red colour regions
ﬂash at unique stimulation frequencies and phase for the
user to make choices. Parameters are altered by ’+’ and ’–’
keys and allow the user to enter the required value for each
parameter.
2.1 Criteria for Synthesis T echniques in BCIs
This paper presents a framework for evaluating sound syn-
thesis techniques based on 2 criteria —eﬃciency of target
utilisation (ETU) and degree of sonic expression .
2.1.1 Efﬁciency of T arget Utilisation (ETU)
The BCI-speller presented in [5] has 40 diﬀerent targets for
the user. The system presents stimulation frequencies in
the range of 8 to 15.8Hz. Studies in [15] show that SSVEP

an amplitude envelope. It has two adjustable
parameters— frequency and amplitude. The red
colour regions stand for targets which allow the user
to make choices.
can be detected over a bandwidth of 1 to 100Hz. However,
stimulation frequencies commonly fall in the range of 6 to
15Hz [33]. A study on ﬁnding an optimal frequency range
for SSVEP is beyond the scope of this paper. Hence, it
is assumed that 40 is the number of targets that will be
available to build a sound synthesiser that uses SSVEP-
based BCI. ETU is calculated by the following formula.
ET U= No. of targets utilised
40 × 100% (1)
2.1.2 Degree of Sonic Expression
In order to evaluate synthesised sounds, diﬀerent objective
measures such as fundamental frequency, spectral centroid,
harmonics, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coeﬃcients (MFCC)
[34] have been used. Most of these metrics in the litera-
ture focus on calculating the similarity between the original
sound and the synthesised sound. However, the objective
of this paper is to provide a novel mechanism for locked-in
syndrome patients to express themselves. Therefore, there
is no particular sound for comparison, but it would be ben-
eﬁcial to have synthesised sounds that are human-like or
natural-sounding.
Degree of sonic expression is an abstract concept and
hence, cannot be formulated or deﬁned by a mathemati-
cal equation. Spectral peaks are one of the primary char-
acteristics of a sound spectrum and are commonly used in
pitch-detection [4] and timbre-analysis [31]. Hence, the ﬁrst
factor that contributes to the degree of sonic expression is
the number of spectral peaks that can be created by the
synthesiser.
Formant regions serve as the spectral signature for vow-
els pronounced by humans and sounds produced by many
instruments [27]. A formant is a concentration of acoustic
energy resonating around a particular frequency [35] and is
an important technique in timbral analysis [21].
In comparison to approaches like linear predictive coding
and MFCC, formants have been chosen due to their sim-
plicity. The number of parameters that can be controlled
by BCI-based sound synthesisers is very less and hence, the
sounds require simple methods for analysis. A vowel is char-
acterized by a unique set of formants. Additionally, the
ratio between formant frequencies is consistent in diﬀerent
voices. [2] suggests that the vocal tract is considered to have
multiple formant regions. Formants are one of the cues that
the human ear uses to identify the sound source. These facts
suggest that the presence of formant regions contributes to
creating natural-like sounds. Therefore, the second aspect
that adds to the degree of sonic expression is the presence
of formant regions.
3. SYNTHESIS TECHNIQUES

This section presents an evaluation of sound synthesis tech-
niques for BCI-based sound synthesisers. It chooses additive
synthesis as the ﬁrst technique to be evaluated.
3.1 Additive Synthesis
Additive synthesis uses several sinusoids as elementary wave-
forms to produce complex signals. It uses oscillators as unit
generators and individually generatespartials by assigning
each oscillator to a particular frequency. Let us consider ad-
ditive synthesisers that are purely based on partial addition.
Each oscillator has 2 inputs— frequency and amplitude. An
SSVEP-based interface for such a synthesiser would require
4 targets to control each oscillator as shown in ﬁgure 1. As-
suming that the total number of possible targets is 40, the
maximum number of unit generators for this system is 10.
The technique obtains an ETU of 100%. However, [27] sug-
gests that realistic instrumental tones and natural-sounding
timbres can be obtained only through time-varying additive
synthesis. Therefore, the interface for a unit generator needs
to be slightly modiﬁed. In time-varying additive synthesis,
the signal from each oscillator is multiplied by an ampli-
tude envelope, which is deﬁned by ADSR— attack, decay,
sustain, and release. The unit generator for additive syn-
thesis needs to be designed as in ﬁgure 2. This interface
requires 12 targets for one oscillator and reduces the num-
ber of oscillators to a maximum of 3. The calculated ETU
for this technique is 90%. The range sounds that can be cre-
ated with 3 sinusoidal oscillators by using additive synthesis
is limited. [27] explains that to synthesise the attack of a
trumpet sound, it requires at least 12 sine wave oscillators.
Figure 2: An oscillator with its amplitude envelope
that uses an SSVEP-based BCI. It has 6 inputs —
frequency, amplitude, attack, decay, sustain, and
release. The red colour regions stand for targets
which allow the user to make choices.
In additive synthesis, the number of spectral peaks is al-
ways equal to the number of oscillators. On one hand, sine
waves are described as pure and natural-sounding and are
capable of re-synthesising any sound. On the other hand, it
requires a considerable amount of control data to generate a
target sound. It is also computationally expensive. Further-
more, spectral peaks generated through additive synthesis
are narrow and do not resemble formant regions. Hence,
additive synthesis is not appropriate for such systems. The
prospects of using simple frequency modulation (FM) is dis-
cussed in the following section.
3.2 Simple FM Synthesis
In the ﬁeld of communication, modulation is the process of
varying a parameter of one signal (carrier) with respect to
a parameter of another signal (modulator). In simple FM,
frequency of one carrier oscillator Oc is varied with respect
to the signal of one modulating oscillator O m. A unit gen-
erator that is used in simple FM synthesis is similar to the
one in additive synthesis, that is an oscillator. But, the am-
plitude envelopes carry out slightly diﬀerent functions. The
ADSR values for Om represent the amplitude envelope for
the modulation index I and not the amplitude envelope for
Om. I is calculated by the following formula.
I = fc − fm
fm
(2)
where fc is the carrier frequency and fm is the modulat-
ing frequency. Tracing back to the history of sound syn-
thesis, FM gained popularity because it was adopted by
the Yamaha corporation and it is computationally inexpen-
sive. [7] was the ﬁrst to explore the musical potential of
FM. An important phenomenon in FM synthesis its abil-
ity to generate side-bands. In 1987, in a Yamaha magazine
advertisement, John Chowning stated that a sound which
contains 50 harmonics will need 50 oscillators to be synthe-
sised through additive synthesis, but FM synthesis enables
you to do it with 2 oscillators [27]. The number of spec-
tral peaks in the output is not limited by the number of
oscillators. It only depends on the amount of modulation
applied to the carrier signal. Hence, it addresses one prob-
lem faced by BCI-based additive synthesisers. In FM, en-
ergy is borrowed from the carrier frequency and distributed
amongst side-bands. Therefore, the amplitude of the car-
rier frequency reduces by applying more modulation. [9]
suggests ways to calculate thesigniﬁcance of side-bands in
simple FM synthesis. Sounds generated by FM synthesis
possess a unique and synthetic spectrum [27]. The spectral
peaks are very narrow and do not produce formant regions.
The energy distribution among side-bands cannot be easily
controlled and individually modiﬁed. This explains the need
to analyse other synthesis techniques that produce formant
regions.
An SSVEP-based BCI synthesiser that adopts simple FM
synthesis utilises 24 targets and realises an ETU of 60%.
This is much lower when compared to additive synthesis.
Simple FM synthesis does not utilise the full potential of
BCIs because it uses only 2 oscillators. Hence, this can
be optimised by evaluating modulation techniques that use
more than 2 oscillators. The following section addresses
the ﬁrst problem faced by simple FM synthesis, that is its
inability to generate formant regions.
3.3 Subtractive Synthesis
Subtractive synthesis attenuates a complex signal and al-
lows only certain regions of the spectrum to generate sound.
It uses a sound source (generally of high spectral density)
like white noise, pink noise, pulse wave, sawtooth wave, or
square wave. Most subtractive synthesisers use a ﬁlter bank,
that is an array of bandpass ﬁlters. Each ﬁlter attempts to
create a formant region in the spectrum of the ﬁnal output.
The unit generator used in subtractive synthesis is a band-
pass ﬁlter. It can be deﬁned by three parameters— centre
frequencyfcentre, gain, and Q. Q of a ﬁlter is deﬁned by the
following formula.
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020
527
Q = fcentre
fhigh − flow
(3)
where fhigh and flow are the upper and lower bounds of the
frequency band respectively.
SSVEP-based BCI designed for a band-pass ﬁlter is shown
in ﬁgure 3. It uses 6 targets to determine the ﬁlter. Addi-
tionally, the subtractive synthesiser needs to deﬁne an am-
plitude envelope for the output signal. This is deﬁned with
the help of ADSR and requires 8 targets. Therefore, 5 unit
generators can be incorporated in the synthesiser. The total
number of targets utilised by it is 38 and realises an ETU of
95%. This is higher than the ETU for additive and simple
FM synthesis.
Figure 3: SSVEP-based BCI designed for subtrac-
tive synthesis. It has three adjustable parameters—
centre frequency, gain, andQ. The red colour re-
gions stand for targets which allow the user to make
choices.
Subtractive synthesis is widely used in music technology
applications and speech synthesis because it can generate
formant regions. It resembles the spectral characteristics
of the human voice and many traditional instruments [27].
The width of every spectral peak generated by a bandpass
ﬁlter depends on the Q of the ﬁlter. A high Q-value pro-
duces a narrow spectral peak and vice versa. Hence, this
allows the user to separately deﬁne the amplitude and width
of each formant region, unlike simple FM synthesis where
the user does not have individual control over side-bands.
Like additive synthesis, the number of spectral peaks is
equal to the number of unit generators. But subtractive
synthesis has the advantage of needing less number of pa-
rameters to deﬁne a unit generator. So, the maximum num-
ber of spectral peaks in the output spectrum is 5. This is
higher than additive synthesis, but considerably less when
compared to simple FM synthesis. Other subtractive ap-
proaches like FOF synthesis [28] and VOSIM [18] follow
more sophisticated methods to generate formants. The unit
generators (FOF grains and VOSIM waveforms) that are
used in these techniques require more number of param-
eters to deﬁne them and hence, would utilise more tar-
gets. Therefore, the next section analyses other forms of
frequency modulation synthesis to increase ETU.
3.4 Multiple Modulator FM Synthesis
Multiple modulator frequency modulation (MMFM) syn-
thesis uses more than one oscillator to modulate a carrier
wave. Similar to simple FM, the modulating oscillator and
carrier oscillator require 12 targets each in the BCI. Hence,
2 modulator oscillators (Om1 and Om2) and 1 carrier oscil-
lator ( Oc) can be deﬁned and an ETU of 90% is obtained.
This is an improvement when compared to simple FM syn-
thesis, which utilised only 60% of the targets.
There are two subdivisions of MMFM— parallel and se-
ries. Parallel MMFM adds the outputs of Om1 and Om2
and then modulates the carrier wave. In series MMFM,
Om1 modulates Om2 and Om2 modulates Oc. MMFM has
two modulation indices, I1 and I2 for Om1 and Om2 respec-
tively. [30] explains the explosion of partials in MMFM.
It produces large number of side-bands for small values of
I1 and I2. The maximum number of signiﬁcant spectral
peaks is much higher than simple FM synthesis. There-
fore, MMFM has greater degree of sonic expression when
compared to simple FM.
MMFM does not produce formant regions. Parallel MMFM
can be used to generate regions of frequencies that are very
close to each other. This might create an illusion of a for-
mant because of the high spectral density in the respective
frequency region. But the presence of a formant peak in
these regions is not necessary. The amplitudes of individual
partials cannot be separately varied. Hence, the degree of
sonic expression of MMFM is limited due to its inability
to generate formant regions. It has advantages and disad-
vantages when compared to subtractive synthesis. On one
hand, the maximum number of spectral peaks that it can
create is much higher. On the other hand, it does not cre-
ate formant regions like subtractive synthesis. The next
section seeks a modulation technique that has the ability to
generate formants.
3.5 Multiple Carrier FM Synthesis
In multiple carrier frequency modulation (MCFM) synthe-
sis, two or more carrier oscillators are simultaneously mod-
ulated by the same modulating signal. An SSVEP-based
BCI synthesiser incorporating this technique would utilise
36 targets and obtain an ETU of 90%. The improvement of
ETU observed in MCFM is similar to the one observed in
MMFM. Both use an additional oscillator for the process of
sound synthesis.
An interesting phenomenon observed in MCFM is its abil-
ity to produce formant regions as shown in ﬁgure 4. [8]
presents the possibilities of using MCFM to synthesise the
singing voice. He explains the formation of formant regions
because of the presence of multiple carrier oscillators. The
output generated by each of the carriers superimpose to cre-
ate a composite spectrum and hence, generating formants.
This proves its advantage over MMFM. The number of for-
mant regions that can be generated by MCFM is equal to
the number of carriers. Hence, an SSVEP-based BCI syn-
thesiser that uses MCFM can create a maximum of 2 for-
mants. In addition to formant regions, side-bands generated
by both carrier oscillators continue to exist in the frequency
spectrum. Hence, the number of spectral peaks that can be
generated by MCFM is high. [26] explored the ability of
MCFM to generate trumpet tones. [24] compared single-
carrier and double-carrier FM synthesis for brass tones. He
stated that double-carrier synthesis sounded more realistic
because of the simultaneous generation of a formant region
and side-bands. [6] used MCFM for the synthesis of singing
voice and vowel sounds. The maximum number of formant
regions that can be generated by subtractive synthesis is
5. A comparison between MCFM and subtractive synthesis
based on this observation is presented in the next section.
The above discussion demonstrates the high degree of sonic
expression of MCFM because of its high ETU and ability
to simultaneously generate side-bands and formant regions.

The following presents a brief comparison of all the synthe-
sis techniques based on the diﬀerent parameters that have
been discussed in the paper.

MCFM.
4. COMP ARISON OF SYNTHESIS TECH-
NIQUES
The paper evaluated sound synthesis techniques based 2
parameters— ETU and degree of sonic expression. The for-
mer is quantitative and calculates a percentage value for
each technique and thus, a greater value determines more
eﬃcient usage of SSVEP-based BCI targets. Among all the
sound synthesis techniques, simple FM scores the lowest
ETU of 60%. Additive, subtractive, MMFM, and MCFM
realise an ETU of 90% or 95%. A diﬀerence of 5% in ETU
attributes to just 2 targets in the BCI and is therefore not
a contributing factor for comparison. Degree of sonic ex-
pression is complex and is broken down into the ability to
generate spectral peaks and formant regions. There is no
deﬁnite method to measure the maximum number of spec-
tral peaks that can be generated by frequency modulation
techniques. Hence, the number of spectral peaks generated
is classiﬁed into 5 categories—very low , low, medium, high,
and very high . The ability to generate formant regions can
be quantiﬁed by calculating the maximum number of for-
mant regions that can be generated. Table 1 tabulates the
abilities of diﬀerent synthesis techniques to generate spec-
tral peaks and formant regions.

Additive Very low Nil
Simple FM High Nil
Subtractive Low 5
MMFM Very high Nil
MCFM High 2
Table 1: Comparison of diﬀerent sound synthesis
techniques based on number of spectral peaks and
number of formants.
Among all sound synthesis techniques, subtractive and
MCFM synthesis are demonstrated to be more eﬃcient than
the other techniques for BCI-based synthesisers. Subtrac-
tive synthesis can generate up to 5 formant regions in the
output spectrum, whereas MCFM can generate only 2. In
phonetics, most studies represent English vowels with the
ﬁrst 2 formants of the sound spectra [17]. Experiments in
[10] suggest that in most cases vowels can be separated by
detecting 2 formants. However, further precision can be
achieved by analysing 3 to 5 formants. [22] analyses the
spectra of musical instruments by comparing it with for-
mant regions observed in vowels. He also stated the pres-
ence of one prominent formant region in woodwind instru-
ments like the bassoon and oboe [12]. [1] analysed Violin,
Clarinet, Trumpet, and Tuba sounds based on only 2 for-
mant regions. [24] synthesised sound of a trumpet by using
MCFM with only 2 carrier waves where 1 carrier was used
to generate the main formant peak at 1500Hz. Therefore,
subtractive synthesis certainly has the advantage of being
able to generate 5 formant regions whereas, MCFM’s abil-
ity to generate 2 formant regions still provides a satisfactory
degree of sonic expression.
Figure 5: Comparison of diﬀerent sound synthesis
techniques based on eﬃciency of target utilisation
(ETU) and degree of sonic expression.
[22] explains the importance of individual partials present
in sound spectra. Apart from formant regions, there is a
high possibility for narrow spectral peaks to be prominent,
for instance ingedackt organ pipes . For low registers of Clar-
inet, it sounds hollow in the absence of second and fourth
partials [22]. [24] generated 5 to 7 partials in addition to
1 formant region while synthesising trumpet tones. Hence,
the ability to generate only 5 spectral peaks imposes re-
strictions and considerably reduces the degree of sonic ex-
pression. Figure 5 evaluates the sound synthesis techniques
based on ETU and degree of sonic expression. MCFM is
recognised as the most suitable synthesis technique for BCI-
based synthesisers.
5. CONCLUDING DISCUSSIONS
This paper proposed the concept of sonic expression, that
is to express oneself purely by the synthesis of sound. Sonic
expression intends to explore novel ways for patients with
locked-in syndrome to express themselves. The paper eval-
uated diﬀerent sound synthesis techniques based on two
criteria— eﬃciency of target utilisation (ETU) and degree
of sonic expression. The former performs a quantitative
evaluation of how eﬃciently the BCI is utilised by each
technique. Degree of sonic expression was presented as an
amalgamation of the ability to generate spectral peaks and
formant regions.
Sonic expression is a new concept and seeks to ﬁnd un-
conventional means of expression for individuals with motor
disabilities. It introduces a new communication medium for
such individuals and may lead to new ways of understand-
ing them. This paper considers the possible number of BCI
targets to be 40. This number is subject to change alongside
research conducted to improve BCIs. The inclusion of more
targets will lead to an increase in the number of adjustable
parameters. This would increase the number of spectral
peaks that can be generated by additive and subtractive
synthesis. It will also increase the number of formants that
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020
529
can be generated by MCFM due to the inclusion of more
carrier oscillators. By incorporating more targets, other
sophisticated synthesis techniques (like FOF synthesis and
VOSIM) that use complex unit generators can be explored.
Degree of sonic expression is presented as a combination
of two parameters— ability to generate spectral peaks and
formant regions. Further research needs to be conducted to
incorporate more parameters to realise sonic expression in
greater depth.
