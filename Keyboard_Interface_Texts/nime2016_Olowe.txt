ABSTRACT
We propose residUUm, an audiovisual performance tool
that uses soniﬁcation to orchestrate a particle system of
shapes, as an attempt to build an audiovisual user interface
in which all the actions of a performer on a laptop are in-
tended to be explicitly interpreted by the audience. We pro-
pose two approaches to performing with residUUm and dis-
cuss the methods utilized to fulﬁll the promise of audience-
visible interaction: mapping and performance strategies ap-
plied to express audiovisual interactions with multilayered
sound-image relationships. The system received positive
feedback from 34 audience participants on aspects such as
aesthetics and audiovisual integration, and we identiﬁed fur-
ther design challenges around performance clarity and strat-
egy. We discuss residUUm’s development objectives, modes
of interaction and the impact of an audience-visible inter-
face on the performer and observer.

1. INTRODUCTION
To express is to convey feelings, thoughts or ideas “through
the manipulation of a medium” such that some degree of
emotional arousal is evoked within an observer [12]. The ex-
pressivity of an audiovisual tool, mediated by a performer,
is revealed to an observer through its aural and/or visual
aesthetic, which, over a duration of time, emerges as a
consequence of a programmed interpretation that material-
izes the translation of sound by image and/or the converse
[6][19]. The interconnection between audition and vision is
negotiated by mapping — creating links that control pa-
rameterized characteristics in one domain utilizing behav-

.
iors of parameters in the other [4][13]. The actions of a
performer can inﬂuence the degree of expressivity that is
disclosed to a viewer. However, movements and gestures
executed from behind a laptop and the unobserved direct
manipulation of software interfaces or hardware devices can
obscure the communication between performer and audi-
ence [7][2]. Hook et al. explore the concept of expressive
interactivity through the lens of the VJ and the context
of HCI for the purpose of proposing modern performance
techniques “that are sensitive to the more nuanced spaces
of user activity,” which concerns the relationship between
performer and observer [12]. Correia and Tanaka have also
explored the landscape of audiovisual tools to investigate
themes, which they hypothesize are fundamental to con-
temporary performance and composition practice: expres-
sion, usability and the relationship between the practitioner
and viewer [9]. Correia formulates his audiovisual research
objectives into a developing framework entitled AudioVi-
sual User Interfaces or AVUIs to overcome the challenges
of performance practice and interaction methods accessible
through the use of current GUIs, which do not aﬀord audi-
ences visual cues from the performer that establish causal
relationships between sound and image 1 [8]. In this paper,
we propose residUUm and focus on its visible interface in
our pursuit to build a successful AVUI.
2. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN
PERFORMER AND OBSERVER
The contribution a musical performer makes while perform-
ing with a traditional instrument can easily be deduced by
an observer. The actor’s physical display and gestures made
with the body demonstrate eﬀort and commitment. The
causal relationship is also conﬁrmed by immediate feedback
between a cause and its eﬀect. However, when a performer
performs using software while interacting with an audiovi-
sual instrument, the causal relationship between sound and
image may not be so clear [2]. The contribution of the actor
(the cause) may be attributed to the system from which the
eﬀect is created or to the user of the tool [19]. Furthermore,
the awareness about the provenance in such performances is
dependent on the perception of the audience [7]. Auslander
discusses the diﬀerent views that challenge the ”traditional
relationship” between the performer and observer: Stuart
assigns the onus of comprehension to the observer who need
only rely on the act of listening, whereas, the traditionalist
point of view states that the relationship between performer
and audience is one based on trust and comprehension on
the part of the observer. However, the adoption of new
composition and performance technologies challenges these
views. Schloss, declares that the act of listening should be
accompanied by a mechanism that appends vision to audi-

271
tion to “clarify the nature of causality” [2].
The control and generation mechanisms used in a tool
such as residUUm via a laptop, has been identiﬁed as a
problematic instrument by Lew. He found that the connec-
tion between audience members who were uneducated in the
culture of audiovisual presentation and the performance was
determined based on assumption (prerecorded video) and
misinterpretation (the role of the performer). Therefore, he
proposes a transparent interface and performative style to
engage an audience with the performer’s actions, process,
and the relationship between the action and process that
mediates the outcome [16][2].
2.1 Multimodal Linking and Mapping
The multimodal relationship between sound and image may
be an aesthetic matter, which can be addressed with design
or left to be answered by psychological empirical inquiry [5].
That “perceptual aspects [of image and sound] connect and
inﬂuence each other” aligns with the traditionalist perspec-
tive. Auslander distinguishes between the sound/image re-
lationship as learned from empirical study and its value in a
cultural context. With respect to experimental psychology,
both visual and audition contribute to the listening experi-
ence as the brain compensates and seeks a source for what
is only heard. With respect to culture, previous experience
and established norms dictate what audiences of diﬀerent
musical performances expect to occur. It is a competence
acquired through experience and subculture [2].
Achieving some degree of “temporal simultaneity” in au-
diovisual performance between sound and image is a basic
condition for acceptance [19]. Sound mapped to an image
such that its appearance (i.e. size, shape, opacity, position)
is associated with its characteristics communicates the im-
pression that the image is linked to its structure [4]. Linking
between sound and image serves as a “general perceptive
function” to describe the relationship between the two. Ka-
puscinski’s concept of linkages presents a merged modality
such that sound and image are equally attended. Linking
is a temporal criterion whose use is to establish relation-
ships between audio characteristics (i.e. density, dynamics,
texture, tempo) and visuals [5]. Real-time linking can be
accomplished externally and manually by the performer or
internally and automatically by the system. External link-
ing relies on human eﬀort and two independent sources of
aural and visual information. Internal linking is a feature of
a system whose visuals are mapped to the internal structure
of an audio signal and are generated directly from an audio
signal in real time [13].
Applied mapping strategies mediate the relationship be-
tween sound and image whatever the complexity of the un-
derlying methodology may be. Callear explores the four
classes of mapping, their subdivisions, and their aﬀordance
for clarity. A chosen implementation can impact an ob-
server’s experience. The causal relationships between sound
and image may be apparent, however, the viewer’s attention
may wane due to banality that develops over time. Com-
plexity and dynamism can resolve the perceptual tedium
that unambiguous mapping strategies can cause [4]. Hunt et
al. introduce the concept of mapping layers by which map-
pings are separated into independent controls for greater
complexity [14].
Ciufo sees a lack of explicit incorporation of sound with
image “on a structural level.” The challenges of mapping
color (and light) and music were illustrated in reviews of
early live performances that involved color organs. The
sound and image relationships, the inﬂuence of music on
the visuals, were perceptively obscure [5]. The attribu-
tion of mapping as a ”blind medium” can be directed to-
wards current audiovisual performances during which rela-
tionships are either composed on a “superﬁcial level of im-
age and sound simultaneity” or are methodically designated
[5][19][18][2]. The visible interface of an AVUI is meant to
convey which eﬀects are triggered by which causes.
3. OVERVIEW OF THE residUUm A VUI
residUUm,2 is a screen-based audiovisual performance tool,
which uses soniﬁcation to orchestrate a particle system of
shapes. It was developed during the second of two hackathons
on generative audiovisuals (GEN.AV2) in support of Cor-
reia’s research into AudioVisual User Interfaces (AVUIs) at
Goldsmiths, University of London, UK. Other soniﬁcation
projects developed during the hackathon were DrawSynth,
Esoterion Universe, and Modulant. 3 The purpose of the
hackathon was to prototype easy-to-use, generative, audio-
visual tools whose interaction was entirely visible for an au-
dience to clearly interpret the causal eﬀects between sound
and image [8]. These requirements informed the interaction
and interface design for residUUm whose system is shown in
Fig. 1. It employs a computer screen and cursor as a visual
interface which, during live performances, is mirrored to a
projection screen visible to the audience. The interaction
is conducted using the computer’s keyboard and mouse or
trackpad.
Figure 1: Schematic of the residUUm system
In residUUm, particles interact with their neighbors and
respond to external inﬂuences as they spawn, move, age,
and die while colliding with one another, contributing to a
din of polyphonic noise. The sonic characteristics of each
object are deﬁned by its graphic attributes: shape, color
ﬁll, size and scene location. The cast bodies, which remain
after colliding with one another are the sounds generated
from the impact of collisions. The term residuum refers
to the remains of a body following some process or event
[1]. Additionally, the suﬃx -duum is reminiscent of the
latin word ”duum”, neuter genitive for ”duo”, referring to
the inherent audio-visual duality of the system.
In residUUm, the mapping between visual characteris-
tics and sound parameters was crucial. Mapping is the last
stage of the creation process. The graphics and audio were
independently developed by the authors. As a general rule,
we tried to avoid linear, one-to-one mappings between the
visual and audio parameter spaces. Occasionally, random
components were added to aﬀord the system to react unpre-
dictably. Some mappings are based on intuition, dictated
by the laws of physics or semantic associations, while other
mapping decisions are entirely arbitrary [11].
Each particle within the canvas is linked to a single voice
of the sound generator. The visual characteristics of the
particle aﬀect the sound that is generated:
2https://github.com/AVUIs/residUUm
3https://github.com/AVUIs
272
Size. The size of the particle is mapped to the frequency of
the oscillator. Smaller sizes correspond to higher frequen-
cies. This mapping builds on the common knowledge that
smaller objects emit higher pitched sounds.
Shape. Each of the particle shapes is associated with a dis-
tinct waveform for the voice’s main oscillator. The concept
of visual shape is directly transformed into the shape of the
waveform.
Color. The color of the particle aﬀects the frequency of
the notches in the ﬁlterbank, conditioning the timbre of the
voice. The timbre of a sound is also called ”sound color”,
[klangfarbe in German] [20]. The vocabulary used to de-
scribe timbre is poor, therefore, we often use semantic de-
scriptions adopted from other senses (i.e. vision) to refer to
them. The choice of mapping the color to timbre is based
on these considerations.
Group. Particles generated during the same mouse press
are assigned to the same group. The waveform of the Low
Frequency Oscillator that modulates the amplitude is unique
for a given group. The group also aﬀects the envelope of the
collision sound of the particle. Therefore, particles created
concurrently will retain a signature of their common char-
acteristic even after they navigate away from one another.
Position-X. The position along the X-axis controls the pan-
ning of the particle in the stereo ﬁeld, with a direct corre-
spondence between the physical location and the position
in the stereo ﬁeld. The same parameter is used to control
the frequency of the amplitude modulation LFO.
Position-Y. The vertical position controls the overall am-
plitude of the sound generated by the particle. It also aﬀects
the central frequency of the band pass ﬁlter, which only in-
ﬂuences the signal coming from the granular oscillator which
soniﬁes collisions.
Lifespan. Two characteristics of the sound are inﬂuenced
by the lifespan of the particle. As the lifespan decreases, the
overall amplitude of the sound generated from the particle
decreases. As the lifespan decreases, the amount of noise
in the amplitude envelope is increased. These mappings
account for the idea that as the particle ages, it becomes
weaker (quieter) and exhibits instability (noise).
Background. The color of the screen background is asso-
ciated with audio eﬀects applied to the master stereo bus.
These eﬀects purposely degrade the audio signal to obtain
a low-ﬁdelity result.
ResidUUm was developed using Daniel Koehler’s punk-
tiert4 particle engine library in Processing 5 and communi-
cates over OSC 6 to send parametric data to a polyphonic
synthesizer bank in Pure Data7. Processing handles the in-
put from the performer, generates the particles, computes
how they interact, move, and evolve, renders the graphics,
and is responsible for voice allocation. Pure Data gener-
ates audio from mapped visual parameters sent over OSC.
Each voice of the synthesizer in the Pure Data patch corre-
sponds to one particle in the Processing sketch. The maxi-

mum number of voices is limited to prevent system overload
and all the resources for the synthesizer voices are allocated
upon startup.
The visible interface in residUUm is controlled by a cur-
sor that exposes the actions of the performer as its position
moves around the canvas. The position of the cursor, the
size, position, shape, color and interactions of the particles
are soniﬁed to indicate causal relationships. However, the
concept of the visible interface is challenged by the laptop
and the system due to the constraints of the software and
parameter programming [11][17]. Keyboard controls add
extra functionality, but their use interferes with the con-
nection between the performer’s actions and the audience.
4. residUUm — A PERFORMANCE TOOL
Makela categorized ﬁve spaces that deﬁne elements of live
cinema, a form of audiovisual performance. Normally, these
spaces are the digital space, the laptop’s storage capacity
for performance assets; the desktop space, the landscape
enclosed within the laptop screen and the interface where
the performer organizes, operates and directs the compo-
nents of the performance; the performance space, the stage;
the projection space, the surface upon which the perfor-
mance is projected; and, the physical space, the setting
and location of the performance. When performing with
an AVUI, the desktop, performance and projection spaces
are compressed into one. The luxury of working with sepa-
rate interfaces or multiple windows to access encapsulated
functions within the software or laptop screen does not ex-
ist. The addition of peripheral interfaces, which extend the
control of performance parameters is prohibited. And, the
ability to work beyond the viewers’ observation, the split
screen between the projection surface and laptop screen, is
eliminated. Here, the three spaces are shared by the per-
former and the viewer. The challenge of the AVUI, and
residUUm’s design, is to exhibit the expressivity of the tool
using a transparent interface. All actions of the performer
are observed by an audience, who should be able to in-
terpret causal cues displayed through audible and visible
interactions [17][19].
The following sections discuss two strategies employed to
address the impact of an AVUI on residUUm as a audiovi-
sual performance tool.
4.1 Performance Strategy 1 — a gaming
approach to sound composition
residUUm was presented and performed, by the second au-
thor, to an audience on July 30, 2015 in an auditorium on
the campus of Goldsmiths College, University of London. 8
For this performance, the author aimed to use residUUm
as a traditional musical instrument. As a performer’s visual
demonstration is an essential part of the music creation pro-
cess, he physically gestured in full view of the audience while
employing residUUm as a sound composition tool, primarily
utilizing the graphic interface as a means to interact with
the audio engine. Throughout the performance, the au-
thor planned to challenge the randomness in residUUm and
layer quiet drones in the background while visually compos-
ing alternate sections with a number of spawned, short-lived
sounds and large groups of loud particles in the foreground
as shown in Fig. 2.
Randomness is a signiﬁcant component of the residUUm
engine. The visual attributes (i.e. shape, color and size)
assigned to the particles are completely random as are the
attraction forces and characteristics of the generated sound:
pitch and timbre. Randomness, in conjunction with the
8https://youtu.be/eidlWCgSoJY

limited set of controls available, continuously challenges the
performer to control a system that is not designed to be
entirely controlled. For example, the performer can use the
gravitational attraction force of the cursor to move parti-
cles throughout the screen, however, it is diﬃcult to inter-
act with an individual particle. Separating two or more
colliding particles or moving only the intended particle(s)
while leaving others is a challenge. Keyboard controls are
available to the performer to set the initial lifespan of newly
generated particles and the rate at which particles on screen
fade out. The user can control the lifespan of particles in ad-
vance of their creation. After a group of particles is created,
the performer has no control over the lifespan of individual
particles, but can adjust the global fade rate of all the parti-
cles on screen. The performer must plan deliberate actions
that disrupt the function of the system in order to control
individual particles.
To obtain a background drone, a particle has to be se-
lected and its lifespan sustained inﬁnitely. However, obtain-
ing quiet drones to keep in the background is not a straight-
forward process. ResidUUm is not programmed to generate
quiet particles. Particles have to be created and their voice
and appearance faded to a point at which they almost dis-
appear. A strategy was devised to select a single particle.
First, the fading rate of the lifespan was set to an average
value and, using the mouse, one particle was generated at
a time. If the particle did not meet the required charac-
teristics of pitch and timbre, it was discarded by allowing
the lifespan to immediately fade out. If the particle’s char-
acteristics were selected and retained, its voice was damp-
ened before its lifespan was sustained. A technique used to
smoothly transition from a loud section with many particles
to a quiet section was to allow most of the active particles
to fade out until only a few remained barely visible and
then set them to sustain for the duration. These particles
became the background drones for the next section.
Overall, the interaction with the system shifted the in-
tended presentation from an arranged musical performance
towards that of a video game predicated on chance. The
particles generated by the computer were seen as random
challenges, which the author could discard — continuing to
curate particles that aligned with his plan — or use as a
creative stimulus to spontaneously compose based on the
characteristics presented.
The keyboard controls were used to create multiple layers
of interaction between diﬀerent sets of particles. The use of
layering in this performance reestablished the landscape of
Mekela’s desktop space in the elemental hierarchy of audio-
visual performance by using depth to expand the volume
of the screen. Although the condition of an entirely visi-
ble interaction was not satisﬁed due to the lack of explicit
feedback communicated to the audience when the keys are
engaged, implicit feedback is indicated by the relationship
between groups of particles. Some sustain their lifespan
while others fade over varying periods of time. Some project
their sonic characteristics while some remained quiet. This
use of the canvas created visual and musical relations be-
tween separate groups and individual particles that sought
to extend the limits of residUUm’s visible interface.
4.2 Evaluation of Performance 1
4.2.1 Quantitative Results
The evaluation of the ﬁrst public performance of residUUm
was conducted using an audience survey created and col-
lected by Correia. Demographic information about the age,
gender, occupation and experience with sound and audio-
visuals was queried from each participant. For each of the
three two-part questions, the audience was asked to rate the
performance on a Likert scale, from 1 to 5, based on the va-
riety and diversity of the presented visuals, the perceptual
relationship between the audio and visuals and perceptual
impact of the performers actions upon the visual presenta-
tion. The second part of each question was open-answer.
Participants were asked to complete one sentence about the
audio and visuals, the relationship between them and the
overall performance.
The results of the survey are shown in Fig. 3. Most par-
ticipants, who answered, felt that the visuals in residUUm
were diverse and varied. residUUm’s particles are diverse
in shape and varied in hue and opacity. 27 viewers felt
the relationship between the sound and visuals were good.
And, most felt there was a fair to clear causal relationship
between the performer’s actions and visual feedback. The
low responses for both questions may account for the events
triggered by keyboard controls, which were hard to discern,
or the lack of visual feedback for sonic events.
4.2.2 Qualitative Results
We performed thematic analysis on the results of the open-
answer questions following the step-by-step guide with six
phases of analysis provided by Braun and Clarke. We started
by getting familiar with the feedback data, generating ini-
tial codes, then searching and reviewing themes, and ﬁnally
deﬁning and naming themes[3]. Five themes emerged from
the thematic analysis of qualitative data collected from the
audience:
Theme 1. Viewing Experience:“Fun”as a motif was men-
tioned in response to all three open-answer questions: the
variation of visuals, the perceived audio visual relationship
and as a critique of the overall performance. The presenta-
tion was described as “evocative” and “engaging,” the view-
ing experience as “palatable” and “tangible.”
Theme 2. Interaction: Audience members described the
interaction in terms of the interface and the relationships
between the particles. The cursor was a “focal point,” mak-
ing the production easy to follow along with the performer’s
actions. One participant suggested that residUUm would
easily adapt to a gestural interface using the Kinect or Leap
Motion. The interaction was noted for promoting “interest-
ing ideas” for creating sound.
Theme 3. Audio-Visual Aesthetics: The aesthetics of
residUUm was likened to cartoons and recalled Norman
McLaren’s animations as well as video games; the colors
“beautiful,”“hypnotic,”“bold” and, the performance “hand-
some” and “visually nice.”
Theme 4. Integration: The relationship between the au-
dio and visuals was perceived as seamless by most, “like
274
Figure 3: The questions were rated from the least to
the most diversiﬁed visuals, from poor to good au-
dio/visual relationship, and the last rated the per-
former’s actions from obtuse to clear. The aster-
isk(*) denotes the number of participants who did
not provide an answer.
graphic and sound were giving birth to each other.” The
integration between the two modalities was “inseparable,”
“traceable,” and “onomatopoeic.”
Theme 5. Performance Clarity: The relationship be-
tween the audio and visuals was described as clear enough
to follow and “well established,” although the function of re-
lationship was not discernible for the entire duration of the
performance. The ability of viewers to detect the causal-
ity of eﬀects beyond the main mechanic of drawing shapes
to generate sounds was “obscure.” Two participants men-
tioned that causal actions beyond the particle generation
(i.e. the keyboard eﬀects) were hard to depict as they were
“unclear what other changes the parameters did” until after
they were explained.
4.3 Performance Strategy 2 — a learned
approach to audiovisual composition
residUUm was presented and performed, by the ﬁrst author,
to an audience at the Sound/Image Colloquium on Novem-
ber 7, 2015 at the campus of the University of Greenwich,
London.9
This performance sought to address the obscurity of the
causal eﬀects and visibility of the interface. The ﬁrst step
was to decrease the upper limit of sizes at which particles
are generated. Bigger shapes commandeered large percent-
ages of the canvas eclipsing smaller neighbors, which forced
viewers to speculate about what audible, but visually oc-
cluded interactions were taking place between particles be-
neath and around them. Secondly, the visuals were mod-
iﬁed to introduce contrast in the canvas. Thresholds were
set to trigger changes in Saturation and Brightness of the
9https://youtu.be/AAQIPeOyCpk
background. This change added monochromatic moments
to disrupt the monotony of the color permutations within
the background and shape transitions. Thirdly, two graphic
styles were created to visually indicate collisions as shown
in Fig. 4, which were only perceptible through sonic events
during the ﬁrst performance. The line thickness was vari-
able (controlled through the keyboard) for one and static
for the other. Lastly, a parameter to adjust the framerate
was added to aﬀord the performer the ability to vary speeds
throughout the audio and visual composition. At a contin-
uous 24 frames per second, no opportunity permitted the
observer’s gaze to rest, or the performer to build suspense,
tension or anticipation.
Figure 4: Visual collision between particles
The aim of this performance was to create a learned
causal relationship between the performer’s actions and the
projected result as observed by the audience. The particle
system was introduced to the audience by slowly increas-
ing the number of shapes and their accompanying sounds
to the canvas. The author interacted with individual and
groups of shapes to familiarize the observer with the causal
eﬀects of cursor as larger collections of shapes were gener-
ated to coexist on the same canvas. The lifespans of the
particles were varied over diﬀering periods of time while
colors evolved in the background to inﬂuence the percep-
tion of their hues [15]. Collisions were triggered to show
how they were represented by a graphic style. The per-
former’s actions responded to the spontaneous contrasted
visual events by tempering movement within the canvas.
The framerate was decreased at irregular, increasing inter-
vals until a speed at which visual patterns appeared. The
patterns, which interrupted the operation of the system,
created multilayered interactions visually and audibly. A
visual impression, which acted as an underlying rhythmic
structure helped to support the audible composition like a
visual beat. The framerate was slowly increased with peri-
ods of rest between slower speeds to emphasize the relation-
ship between the discrete visual beating and the continuous
audio composition. Upon reaching the normal 24 frames
per second, the lifespan of currently spawned shapes were
decreased until the din transitioned to silence.
4.4 Discussion of Performance 2
The author was able to follow the planned strategy for the
performance, but discovered that using keyboard controls
imposed new obstacles on usability. The cursor was used
to indicate the shape and color of the particles and new
keyboard controls were added to make adjustments to the
graphic style of the collisions and framerate. The keyboard
controls which regulate the lifespan of the particles and the
graphic drawing style oﬀer audible and visual feedback to
275
the performer. However, other than the visual feedback
from the canvas about the descending or ascending framer-
ate, the performer is unaware of the precise framerate. A
solution is needed to oﬀer usability and causal cues for the
user and the observer, respectively. The visible interaction
of the performer is the primary tenet of a successful AVUI
[8]. Finding solutions to expand interaction without rely-
ing on the keyboard as a performance interface needs to be
addressed.
There are two ways this performance can be evaluated.
Using an audience study to compare the new version of
residUUm with the original could investigate how the changes
made to the system eﬀect the quality of the visuals, the re-
lationship between the sound and visuals, the perception
of causal actions of the performer, the overall performance
and interface visibility. However, there are new questions
to pose that examine only this performance. A visible in-
dication has been added to the collision events, which leads
to inquiries about the visual expectation for sonic events
that occur in nature, the visual representation of a sonic
event in which bodies with various sizes and sound proper-
ties adopt characteristics from the physical world, life expe-
rience and memory. In addition, deﬁning the minimal visual
characteristics necessary for an audience to distinguish sub-
tle diﬀerences between similar events deserves investigation.
The visual contrasts, pacing and variation of timing using
the framerate, their eﬀect on the composition of vision and
audition individually and as an integrated couplet may be
another line of inquiry. The ability to generate patterns,
which is currently described as implied audio, using visuals
was a consequence of varying residUUm’s operating speed.
At slower framerates the audio continues to provide con-
tinuous feedback from the mapped particles, however, the
response from the visuals are divorced from their united cou-
pling. Examining visual beats that occur without a paired
audible response in an audience setting may reveal ﬁndings
about linkages between audition and visual counterpoint,
consonance and dissonance and, the impact of layered vi-
sual interactions on the performer and observer experience.
5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This paper examines mapping and performance strategies
used in residUUm, an AudioVisual User Interface for au-
diovisual performance. Two performers utilized diﬀerent
approaches that layered interactions as a method to ex-
press causal audiovisual relationships while performing with
residUUm’s shared interface. This multilayered approach to
visible interaction aimed to examine the challenges of per-
forming with and observing an AVUI.
residUUm, as an audiovisual tool, is limited by the key-
board interface of the laptop [11]. We propose two methods
to create a visible interface through which all actions of the
performer are clearly projected to the observer. Yielding
part of the interaction to the system to negotiate dynamic
relationships between particles may aﬀord the user to fo-
cus attention on higher level interactions and contribute
to a collaborative role with the machine as an external in-
ﬂuence on internal audiovisual interactions [10] [11]. Cur-
rently, many of the local and global attraction forces pro-
grammed in residUUm are hardcoded. Dynamically map-
ping the forces to represent spatial, sonic and color rela-
tionships may aid both the observer and the performer with
creating improved, visible interactions.
