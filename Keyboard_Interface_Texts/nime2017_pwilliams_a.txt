ABSTRACT
While there are a great variety of digital musical interfaces
available to the working musician, few oﬀer the level of im-
mediate, nuanced and instinctive interaction that one ﬁnds
in an acoustic shaker. bEADS is a prototype of a digi-
tal musical instrument that utilises the gestural vocabulary
associated with shaken idiophones and expands on the tech-
niques and sonic possibilities associated with them.
By using a bespoke physically informed synthesis engine,
in conjunction with accelerometer and pressure sensor data,
an actuated handheld instrument has been built that allows
for quickly switching between widely diﬀering percussive
sound textures. The prototype has been evaluated by three
experts with diﬀerent levels of involvement in professional
music making.

1. INTRODUCTION
Electronic percussion has been commercially available since
the 1980s. Their use, and the sounds they can produce
have become more sophisticated and they are used in many
genres of music.
Sales of electronic drum-kits have been steadily increas-
ing for year, and now appear to be outselling their acous-
tic counterparts. [11] The Electronic Percussion Industry
Council (EPIC) has recently been established to help pro-
mote and educate in the use of electronic percussion. [2]
These instruments are clearly popular and are likely to con-
tinue increasing in popularity.
In many music circles a distinction is made between the ti-
tle of Drummer and Percussionist. Whilst drummers are in-
deed percussionists, there are percussionists who have great
success without sitting behind a drum kit. Other electronic
percussion formats are produced, such as the MalletKat,
but electronic percussion seems to have evolved mostly from
the drum-kit and the drum-pad. [14] What of percussion-
ists who are not drummers? Would they not beneﬁt from an

interface that caters to their highly reﬁned set of gestures,
that can cover a myriad of sounds and control possibilities?
Commercial electronic percussion products have become
increasingly sophisticated since they ﬁrst became popular
in the eighties. But the reasons for the continuing increase
in their uptake amongst musician’s remain the same. Ben
Meyer reviewed these advantages which are summarised in
table 1. [13]. A review of drumming forums revealed some
common criticisms, whilst these criticisms may not be uni-
versally applicable or accurate, they give some indication
as to consumer perception, and therefore Digital Musical
Instrument (DMI) design requirements.
In music technology circles there are interfaces that present
a variety of possibilities for capturing gesture for musical
purposes. They are not in any way restricted to the drum-
kit paradigm and many of them, such as Navid Navab’s
Gesture Bending and Greg Beller’s Synekine Project, have
been applied with percussive eﬀect. Performers such as Alex
Nowitz, Andrew Stewart have also achieved expressive and
sophisticated musical performances using non-conventional
music controllers (Wii remote and T-stick), but these ex-
amples seem to be the exception rather than the rule [23,
25].
The physical form and method of interaction with an
instrument using physical modelling was investigated with
Physmism [8]. One of the ﬁndings was that a well designed
and natural feeling interface can easily be appreciated by
a musician when exploring the possibilities that physical
modelling can provide.
[15, 16, 24, 7] Despite the great artistic potential of these
technologies, the commercial trends seem to be pointing
even more towards the portable rather than the expressive.
DrumPants, Aerdodrums and Freedrumall do away with the
need for a drum surface to provide a small physical footprint
and quick set-up, and seemingly sacriﬁce some degree of
nuance in the process. [3, 1, 4]
Numerous studies have investigated the impact of cuta-
neous transfer of audio information in various Human Com-
puter Interaction (HCI) scenarios. O’Modhrain and Essl
developed Pebble Box and Crumble Bag to ”uncover in-
stances of coupling, however loose, between the haptic and
auditory senses”[19]. In Playing by FeelO’Modhrain lays
out a model of motor skill acquisition in the practice of a
musical instrument where the methods a musician employs
to monitor the state of their instrument and their own per-
formance progress through various stages, she argues that
haptic feedback can play an important role in learning a
new instrument [17]. Cook also considers haptic feedback
as a potentially valuable tool in a digital musical instru-
ment. He employs a solenoid in his Haptic Maracato open
up this feedback modality within the format of a shaker [10].
Amongst the most valued qualities of acoustic instru-

ments is ability to transfer the more detailed aspects of
music, beyond timing and overall dynamics. These details
are clearly important to the musician, but also have an im-
pact on the audience. Many electronic percussion instru-
ments cannot distinguish between the strike of a drumstick
and the tap of a ﬁnger. Clearly this is a shortcoming, one
only has to consider the care that drummers take in choos-
ing the weight, material, design and general style of their
sticks. The ability to completely change sound, and make
noises that would not normally be possible with an acoustic
instrument are the cherished advantages of a digital ap-
proach.
Shakers are a sub–group of percussion instruments that
can be found in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and mate-
rials. They can be found in various forms in most cultures
and date back to at least three thousand years ago. [20]
Most musicians are familiar with their use at some level,
and for most humans, a shaker, in the form of a rattle, is the
ﬁrst music instrument they are likely to hold. Interaction
with these instruments is both instinctive, and suﬃciently
intricate to allow for expressive use. This paper describes
a prototype DMI – bEADS (see ﬁgure 1) which has been
designed in the hope that such an instrument open up the
world of Electronic Percussion to a new group of musicians.
Unlike Cook’s Haptic Maraca, bEADS is modelled after a
generic form of shaker where the performer’s hand is in con-
tinuous contact with the primary resonant material of the
instrument. This model was chosen as it is more typical
of the shakers that are in common use across music genres,
allows for the exploration of standard playing techniques
related to grip variation (implemented as pressure sensor
readings) and mimics shakers where a more signiﬁcant level
of cutaneous information transfer might occur.
2. AN ACTUATED DIGITAL SHAKER
bEADS stands for Extended Actuated Digital Shaker. It
takes advantage of the gesture vocabulary associated with
an acoustic shaker, extends the possible interaction and
sonic capabilities of shaken idiophones and is actuated to
provide a realistic, credible user experience.
2.1 Construction
The shaker housing was made from laser-cut 6mm MDF. It
housed all of the following equipment with the exception of
the laptop running the Max/MSP patch.
A Grove - IMU 10DOF motion sensor was used as an
accelerometer. Gyroscope information was not used in an
attempt to reduce latency in the Arduino code. A single
5 mm Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) was sandwiched inside
the shaker housing. An Arduino Uno was employed to send
IMU and FSR data to Max/MSP which generated both
audio and haptic output. These signals were sent to the
three watt class D stereo acoustic ampliﬁer board powering
Figure 1: bEADS
the two 1 watt audio exciters, which were attached to the
inside of the shaker housing.
2.2 The Synthesis Engine
Taking inspiration from PhISEM, as described in [9], a syn-
thesis engine has been created to mimic some of the qualities
of shaker instruments.
The accelerometer data is used to create an amplitude
envelope, this envelope is applied to a white noise signal.
A threshold is then created by multiplying the envelope by
a user deﬁned factor. When the enveloped noise exceeds
the threshold a collision is modelled with an impulse signal
output. The envelope is then applied to the series of impulse
signals.
This stochastic signal is then sent to a bandpass ﬁlter.
Instead of attempting to simulate existing materials, control
of the ﬁlter parameters is carried out by manipulation of
the shaker, thus extending the expressive capabilities of the
instrument.
2.2.1 Colouration
During the initial stages of software development a simple
soniﬁcation approach was used to explore the possibilities of
bEADS. Assigning the frequency of elementary wave forms
to direction of force led to entertaining results. This led to
the metallic and Cuica modes described below.
2.2.2 Mapping
14
Figure 2: Schematic of bEADS circuitry
Sound synthesis is controlled via motion and pressure via
the shaker, whilst various parameters and mappings can be
deﬁned via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the laptop
running Max/MSP. See ﬁgure 3.
The accelerometer x, y and z data is converted from
Cartesian to spherical coordinates so that magnitude and
direction can be used for mapping. A constant approxi-
mating acceleration due to gravity is subtracted from the
magnitude value.
2.2.3 Envelope
The magnitude of the spherical accelerometer data controls
the amplitude of the synthesised sound, and by implica-
tion the envelope. Two line objects provide overlapping
envelopes for attack and decay 1.
The attack and decay times, and their gain values can be
altered via the GUI.
2.2.4 Band Pass Filter
The x value of the accelerometer is mapped to the centre
frequency of a band-pass ﬁlter, this results in diﬀerent ﬁl-
tering eﬀects depending on the orientation and rotation of
the shaker whilst in use.
Depending on user selection via the Max/MSP GUI, the
width of this ﬁlter can be changed during performance by
increasing or decreasing grip pressure.
2.2.5 Metallic Sound
When the metallic colouration is selected via the GUI, di-
rection of force (azimuth and polar angles) control the fre-
quencies of two dissonant sine waves.
The balance between metallic sound and collision sounds
is controlled by the grip pressure.
2.2.6 Cuica Sound
When the Cuica colouration is selected the frequencies of
two sawtooth waves are modulated by force direction (as
with the metallic colouration) and by grip pressure. The
tighter the grip, the higher the pitch.
2.2.7 Haptic Feedback
Haptic and audio signals are sent to separate transducers in
the shaker housing.
Depending on the user selection via the GUI the haptic
feedback can either follow the attack portion of the enve-
lope, or the entire synthesised sound.
1It should be noted that in this scope attack and decay do
not refer to standard ADSR parameters, but rather two line
objects that govern the overall response to a given accelera-
tion. Attack, in this instance might roughly equate to attack
and decay, and decay representing sustain and release. In
reality they overlap somewhat.
Figure 3: Coarse overview of the bEADS system
It was determined during development that when haptic
feedback was governed by the entire acoustic amplitude the
experienced became confusing. The preferred condition is
obtained by using the attack portion of the signal.
Attempts to use the synthesised audio signal as the haptic
feedback source were unsuccessful as often these signals did
not result in the shaker housing resonating at a frequency
that could be detected via cutaneous sensation.
A sawtooth wave at 40 Hz was chosen as the base vibra-
tion signal. This provides a high energy whilst still feeling
natural. The selected envelope is then used to control the
amplitude of this signal, which is subsequently ﬁltered to
ensure that any audible aspect of the haptic signal is re-
duced.
2.3 Evaluation
Three experts were selected to help evaluate bEADS. They
were all male, aged between 38 and 53 and heavily involved
in music in various ways. They all play percussion instru-
ments. There were separate evaluation sessions for each
expert. Evaluation took between three and four hours per
person.
Evaluation took the form of a series of simple musical
tasks, directed, informal interview, comparison to a selec-
tion of three acoustic shakers and open experimentation
with the instrument. Video was recorded during evaluation
and used further scrutinise interaction with the shaker.
2.3.1 Playing with a Metronome
This test was carried out ﬁrst as it is a basic exercise and
should therefore be possible if bEADS is to function prop-
erly. The feedback settings were also alternated to ascertain
how eﬀective the actuated design was. See table 2.
All three subjects were able to play along with a metronome,
without instructions as to how to play. This test shows that
the interaction is instinctive, and that bEADS is, at least
at this elementary level, a functioning musical instrument.
There was no signiﬁcant variation in Likert scores for
playability between settings. However, all three expressed
a strong aesthetic preference for having the acoustic and
haptic feedback from the shaker. Each musician was asked
to play in tempo with a metronome set at 120 bpm, for one

minute, using a basic eighth note rhythm. See ﬁgure 5.
2.3.2 Informal Interview
Each musician was encouraged to play with bEADS, and
the other three available shakers(see Figure 6) whilst dis-
cussing and evaluating a set of qualities and design aspects
that had been chosen after reviewing various approaches to
musical instrument evaluation. [18, 6, 22] These discussions
continued throughout the rest of the testing session.
The overall response from the three musicians was posi-
tive. Feedback is summarised in table 3.
In addition to traditional shaker gestures and sounds, all
three musicians found that new gestures could be used for a
diﬀerent set of musical eﬀects. They felt it could be used as
a sound eﬀects controller. One expert stated that he felt it
was an instrument in it’s own right and could be composed
for.
There was a consensus that the size of the shaker, com-
bined with using grip pressure as a control gesture, led to
fatigue in the hand.
The mapping of x value from raw accelerometer readings
to ﬁlter centre frequency (see section 2.2.2) led to some con-
fusion. It made the shaker very sensitive to rotation about
the z axis, which was aﬀected by how the user happened to
be initially holding it.
2.3.3 System Usability Scale
An adapted System Usability Scale(SUS) questionnaire was
used to determine how easily the control and GUI concepts
were understood.
bEADS scored well – between 60 and 92.5. According to
[5] this equates to an adjective rating between OK and Best
imaginable.
Expert B scored the highest, signiﬁcantly higher than ei-
ther Expert C or Expert A. This ﬁts with his observed play-
ing – he appeared more conﬁdent than Expert A or Expert
C, but less adventurous. Lower scores might be equated
with an instrument that was more nuanced and complex,
or a performer trying to decipher some subtle behaviour
that they had detected.
2.3.4 Comparison to acoustic shakers
The experts were asked to play with each of the four shakers
and line them up from best to worse for each of the qualities
and design aspects discussed in section 2.3.2.
bEADS scored well in experienced freedom and possibil-
ities, and explore-ability, on average beating all three of
the other shakers. bEADS got it’s worst rating for timing
control and for learn-ability. Expert B and Expert A both
stressed that they believed it was just a matter of getting
to know the instrument. This result, combined with obser-
vations made in test 2, led to an experiment (see section
2.4) which uncovered latency and jitter issues which were
16
Experienced Freedom
and
possibilities
Expert A and expert B were excited by the possibilities, which they stated were
beyond those of a normal shaker. Expert C felt that he needed more time to really
judge this aspect. See Explore-ability
Perceived control and
comfort
With the exception of Expert B, the experts found the size, unfamiliar response and
use of grip pressure led to fatigue in their hands.
Perceived stability,
sound quality
and aesthetics
bEADS was judged to be stable and produced a professional quality sound. The
volume produced was considered to be too quiet for anything other than solo practice.
Learn-ability The control of ﬁlters, pitch and cross-fading between sounds, combined with be-
havioural diﬀerences from acoustic shakers, were considered to be something that
required time to master. All felt that this could be accomplished with time. Expert
A observed ”The more stories you can tell, the longer it takes to learn them”
Explore-ability The musicians initially approached bEADS with a behavioural model built on prior
knowledge of acoustic shakers. Expert C, being the least experienced musician
amongst them found it more challenging to master rhythmic control of the new in-
strument. This became an obstacle to exploration. All three had diﬀerent comments
with regard to explore-ability, all were connected with learn-ability The professional
musicians were most inclined to continue exploring.
Feature controllability Overall the evaluators felt that, once they knew how to control the various features,
that they were easy to control, or could be learnt. Expert C found controlling with
orientation most challenging.
User experience bEADS was found to be interesting, inspiring and enjoyable by all the experts. Expert
B noted that holding the sound source in your hand made it feel like a real instrument.
He considered haptic feedback to play an important role in this. All three found the
wires somewhat frustrating. As noted above in perceived control and comfort, grip
pressure led to hand fatigue.
Timing Controllability Opinion was divided. Expert B found it no more or less diﬃcult than other shakers.
Expert A and expert C felt it was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Only expert C felt that it
was signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult.
Categorisation It was felt unanimously that bEADS could be described as instrument like, or as an
extended instrument
Table 3: Key observations from experts
not immediately apparent during development.
2.4 Latency and Jitter
The bEADS shaker unit was placed on a thin cushion on
a table. The audio output from bEADS and the in-built
microphone signal were routed to separate channels of a
Zoom R16 multitrack recorder. The bEADS shaker housing
was then struck gently with an open palmed hand twenty
times.
The resulting recordings were then mixed into a stereo
ﬁle in Matlab. The diﬀerence in onset times between the
microphone and bEADS output signals obtained using the
measure tool in Sonic Visualiser was taken as Latency. Jit-
ter was calculated from the diﬀerences between all possible
pairwise combinations of the latency readings.
Latency and jitter were both found to be far higher than
the recommended target values. See table 4.
In a study of latency tolerance for theremin performance
it was noted that subjects over the age of thirty were less
perceptive of latency. All the experts use in this study are
over this age threshold. However, all subjects in this study
were able to detect latency of around 100 ms with similar
accuracy. In the same paper it is pointed out that a church
organ can have several hundred milliseconds of latency, and
can still be played with practice. [12]
The jit.fpsgui object is used in the bEADS patch to report
frame update rate. This reports a value for frame update
between 4.5 and 5 ms. This would result in jitter greater
than the commonly used 1 ms benchmark, but not as high
as the recorded values. Further investigation was carried
out by recording the raw accelerometer data from within
Max/MSP. These recordings showed that new values were
being updated every 20 ms. The origin of this jitter is still
the subject of investigation.
Average Jitter
Latency Max Min Average SD
115.3 ms 21 ms 0 ms 8.55 0.006
Table 4: Results of a simple latency test
These values require further study and explanation. In
a parallel study an experiment has been designed to shed
more light on why such high levels of jitter were not imme-
diately apparent in development or evaluation. [21]
3. CONCLUSIONS
A prototype of an actuated digital music shaker instrument
has been designed, built, and evaluated by three invited
experts.
It is believed that such an instrument would provide musi-
cians who do not play kit drums, particularly percussionists,
with a tool to experiment with the freedoms and creative
possibilities of digital musical instruments.
The current implementation can be improved upon by
choosing higher performance components, reducing latency
and Jitter, more closely modelling the behaviour of an acous-
tic shaker and allowing for integration with other systems
via protocols such as Open Sound Control (OSC). Future
iterations of bEADS could take advantage of technologies
such as concatenative synthesis to extend the sonic palette
of the instrument.
The high latency and jitter of bEADS is surprising given
that the experts felt that the instrument behaved predictably
with regard to timing. This could be an interesting area of
17
further research, both to verify the results obtained during
this study, and to understand this phenomena.
The author believes that the reﬁnement of the existing
mappings, GUI controls, and their integration into a single
ampliﬁer and control unit, combined with a more reﬁned,
perhaps wireless or entirely self contained shaker housing
would result in an attractive addition to the world of elec-
tronic percussion. This belief is supported by the positive
reaction of the selected experts who helped evaluate the
instrument.
