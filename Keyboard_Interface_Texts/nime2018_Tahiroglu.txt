ABSTRACT
This paper introduces various ways that idiomatic gestures
emerge in performance practice with new musical instru-
ments. It demonstrates that idiomatic gestures can play an
important role in the development of personalized perfor-
mance practices that can be the basis for the development
of style and expression. Three detailed examples – biocon-
trollers, accordion-inspired instruments, and a networked
intelligent controller – illustrate how a complex suite of fac-
tors throughout the design, composition and performance
processes can inﬂuence the development of idiomatic ges-
tures. We argue that the explicit consideration of idiomatic
gestures throughout the life cycle of new instruments can fa-
cilitate the emergence of style and give rise to performances
that can develop rich layers of meaning.

1. INTRODUCTION
The ideal of “expression” suggests a contingent and spon-
taneous quality of performances with new musical instru-
ments that is encompassed by the term situated interaction
[13] — interactions inﬂuenced in real-time by relationships
and exchanges between various actors, roles, technologies
and environments, which may include musician, composer,
luthier, instrument, audience, performance environment. It
is signiﬁcant that this in-the-moment musical interaction
with the instrument provides primary information for co-
ordinating upcoming performative actions and guiding the
musician through the sound world of a particular instru-
ment. The situated quality of musical interactions further
informs performative style —the ways a musician adds par-
ticular variations to the characteristics of the performance
through gestures that are idiomatic to the instrument and
expressive of the musician’s intent [18].

This paper documents the authors’ experiences and reﬂec-
tive observations on the development and emergence of id-
iomatic gestures in our own performance practices with new
instruments of our own design. The concept of idiomatic
gesture elaborates on Vasquez et al.’s discussion ofidiomatic
composition in the context of NIME [41] with a new focus
on the repertoire of physical actions involved in the per-
formance of a new instrument and their role in conveying
or fostering extramusical meaning in NIME performances.
We argue that the development of idiomatic gestures is in
part what enables ‘NIMEs’ to go beyond sound producing
tools or demonstrations to performative (or what are com-
monly called “expressive”) musical instruments. Scholars
and artists have long attempted to ﬁnd ways to understand
the complex nature of musical expression – the so-called ‘E’
in NIME [11]. Certainly one aspect of this notion of expres-
sion inheres in the gestures that emerge from the complex,
personal, and embodied relationship between the performer
and instrument. In this regard, understanding idiomatic
uses of gestures in the context of new musical instruments
can reveal a new set of design values for us to explore in our
development of and interactions with NIMEs, which will
shed light on the challenge of creating ‘expressive’ NIME
performances.
In the following sections, we ﬁrst present an overview of
related work that elaborates the concept of idiomatic ges-
tures in the context of music performance, then we dis-
cuss examples from our own NIME practices in terms of
idiomatic gesture. Following that we will discuss the key
features in contextualising idiomatic gestures in NIMEs and
conclude our paper with future work.
2. STYLE AND FORM OF IDIOMATIC GES-
TURE IN MUSIC PERFORMANCE
Jensenius [24] highlights a variety of disparate senses of the
term gesture, calling upon authors to clarify their intended
meanings. While in NIME we often tend to associate ges-
ture with actual physical movement, and correspondingly
the physical characteristics of a musical instrument, there is
also a long tradition of describing music in terms of compo-
sitional ‘musical’ gestures, e.g., [20]. Hatten deﬁnes human
gesture as “any energetic shaping through time that may be
interpreted as signiﬁcant,” where signiﬁcance is gauged in
terms of aﬀective, modal, or communicative meaning inter-
preted by an observer [21]. For the purposes of the present
paper, we use the term to denote physical actions that are
imbued with meaning, and given the context, we are con-
cerned with those involved in the course of musical perfor-
mance. To this we add two caveats. First, referring back to
Hatten and consideration our situated perspective, we stip-
ulate the meanings in question are not necessarily commu-
nicative or intentional; they may be contingent, emergent,
126
and individualized. Second, as we shall see in the case of
bio-controllers in §3, the physical actions do not need to
involve large-scale motion, and can be minute or isometric.
The relationship between so-called ‘musical gestures’ and
gestures that involve actual physical movement is debatable—
whether metaphorical, analogical, or perceptually-rooted—
but nonetheless it is noteworthy that some authors also dis-
cuss musical gestures as being idiomatic to musical styles
or forms. Broyles asserts that two stylistic “streams” un-
derlie all classical music – a sonata style and a symphonic
style, which are independent of actual orchestration and are
distinguishable by “idiomatic gestures” that are evident in
melodic, textural and formal material [3]. He argues that
even solo pieces such as Beethoven’s Piano Sonata, Op. 2,
No. 1 can be stylistically symphonic due the idiomatic use
of symphonic gestures. Palmer [35] employs a similar ap-
proach to the use of idiomatic closing gestures in tonal mu-
sic, as means of closure that builds up some expectation on
the listener about how the piece will conclude.
In traditional music performance the term ‘idiomatic style’
has been used to draw attention to the importance of the
physical properties of a particular instrument on perfor-
mance practice [2]. For instance, taking advantage of a
ﬁguration more idiosyncratic to violin, Neacsu [32] presents
the idiomatic gesture that Beethoven wrote, which has to be
played on three diﬀerent strings. Violinists described this
gesture as bariolage or baterie; it usually involves a repeated
open-string note, with or without open strings. Similar id-
iomatic gestures are found in some of Beethoven’s piano
works, taking the advantages of motives and motion in the
composition [32]. Similarly, “double staccato” is considered
as one of the playing techniques on the Paetzold ﬂute [1].
Double staccato has been introduced as an idiomatic ges-
ture with a very eﬀective playing technique for situations
where overblowing is used. This idiomatic gesture enables
the player to select harmonic overtones with agility [8].
In contemporary research, accounting for the use of ex-
tended techniques for instrumental music, gestures in music
performance have been identiﬁed in terms of high-level de-
scriptors [28]. Further classiﬁcation of gestures in music
performances have been presented in multiple categories [5,
23]. As a result of a shared ecological knowledge of gestures
[15], shared expectation of sound producing movements and
concept of their aﬀordances with design constraints in dig-
ital musical instruments have also been discussed [30, 22].
Moreover, Dahl, et al. [10] had come to analysis of move-
ments observed in music performance as highly idiosyncratic
through speciﬁc classiﬁcation of gestures appearing in mu-
sical performance. While we can trace a particular interest
in developing a gestural language with a focus on classi-
ﬁcations, most of what follows in development of NIMEs
similarly lacking in idiomatic gestures, lack of established
set of playing techniques.
Paine [34] identiﬁes several aspects for computer musi-
cians to consider when developing a gestural language that
can ensure authenticity, illustrating sound-action coupling
in a more seamless manner. He emphasises the resulting
notion of gestures as forms of structural evolution for music
performance. Cook [9] formulates his approach to idiomatic
gestures with a music composition Pico I for Seashells and
Interactive Glove that introduces a particular idiomatic ges-
ture for the Pico Glove instrument, moving the hand in and
out of the shells that triggers note-generation algorithms.
Malloch and Wanderley [31] also puts an eﬀort in the T-
Stick project to develop notation standards for the new mu-
sical instrument. One of the main threads in their work is
to attempt to transform primary process of developing a
vocabulary of gestures idiomatic to the interface.
It is there already in Choi’s [7] suggestion for formalis-
ing a component model of gestural primitive throughput as
a design principle of new musical instruments. This model
identiﬁes performer’s movements as musical idioms, orienta-
tion towards the musical gestures. In this model, idiomatic
gestures appear when performer’s movement transfers the
gestural primitives into auditory signatures. Choi places the
idiomatic expression at the very core concept of the styles
and forms of idiomatic gestures, through essential aspects
of the auditory signatures that are derived from the instru-
ment’s oscillations in relation to performative movements,
investigating performer’s expressive intentions. Perhaps we
will agree that there is nothing new in the central idea. Mu-
sicians, composers, have always concerned themselves with
the idea of expressive gestures that communicate the true
performative intentions. The notion of performative inten-
tions, has a central position in this paper. We will elaborate
our discussion on idiomatic gestures presenting our three
particular projects, reﬂecting on our own NIME practices.
These projects were chosen as they provide experiential in-
put on idiomatic gestures regarding the work itself and the
work surrounding it.
3. IDIOMATIC GESTURES IN BIO-
CONTROLLERS
If gestures are associated with the physical properties of
the instrument, are there idiomatic gestures for a musical
instrument or controller that has no physical embodiment?
Over the years of developing interfaces that use physiologi-
cal sensors to control music (so called “biocontrollers”) the
answer appears to be yes. For example, from the moment
that real-time bioelectric measurement of muscle tension for
musical control was possible, [26], a language of biophysical
gestures was created. One only has to look at the ﬁrst per-
formances of Tanaka 30 years ago using the BioMuse [39]
alongside the more recent performance of Donnarumma us-
ing his Xth sense bioacoustic sensor [12] to see the com-
monality of gestures. As the performer stresses and strains
the muscles of the arm, a language of torsion, ﬂexion, and
extension emerges. In a piece known as the Biomuse Trio,
this language was transcribed by the authors directly into
the musical score [29] using a cannonical taxonomy of ges-
tures. The idiomatic ﬂexing and straining gestures were
further combined to create multi-gestural gestures. For ex-
ample, in one passage of this piece, the performer imagined
shaping an object between two hands. This yielded simulta-
neous and coordinated ﬂexion and extension of both hands
and forearms creating a compound idiomatic gesture within
the idiomatic vocabulary.
While Biomuse Trio mainly used gestures that are clearly
idiomatic for the BioMuse, one of the discoveries of this
work was gestures that are not idiomatic. For example, the
concept of “arm throw” to trigger a musical event was aban-
doned in subsequent compositional work because in per-
forming the gesture, it was too diﬃcult to create a precise
temporal event and the gesture was not at all idiomatic of
biophysical performance.
The concept of “integral music control” opened up the
possibility for completely removing physical gesture - using
only physiological indicators of the performer’s emotional
state as a means of creating and interacting with sound
[25]. Are there idiomatic gestures for an interface that has
no movement? Like the biophysical control described above,
the answer is yes. While there are no gestures inﬂuenced
by the physicality of the instrument (in fact, there are no
physical gestures at all), there are idiomatic aﬀective ges-
tures. Stem Cells, a piece created for aﬀective gestures, was
127
composed to have the performer traverse a set of emotions
in order to move the piece forward [27]. For example, the
piece ended with the performer slowly achieving a relaxed
state which controlled a series of ﬁlters causing the complex
sound structure to slowly collapse to a single tone. This
emotional gesture was idiomatic in that it took advantage
of the natural relief that a performer feels at the end of a
performance. Other idiomatic gestures included anger for
controlling complex and harsh sounds and joy for control-
ling the presence of staccato sonic structures.
As with Biomuse Trio, Stem Cells also discovered non-
idiomatic gestures. For example, Stem Cells began with
the performer in a relaxed state causing a single note to be
played. Increasing agitation slowly increased the number of
tones to create a complex tonal structure. The problem is
that it is non-idiomatic to start a piece in a relaxed state.
Like the diﬃculty of creating a precisely timed musical event
with an “arm throw”, it is diﬃcult for a performer to begin
a piece in a relaxed emotional state.
4. IDIOMATIC GESTURES IN ACCORDION-
INSPIRED CONTROLLERS
This section contrasts the approaches and results in terms
of idiomatic gestures of two of the earliest controllers associ-
ated with NIME, which were developed independently but
both inspired by instruments in the acoustic accordion fam-
ily: Gurevich and von Muehlen’s Accordiatron, and Cook
and Leider’s SqueezeVox [19, 9]. Both were presented at the
very ﬁrst NIME workshop in 2001. The design of the Accor-
diatron (Figure 1) was motivated initially by the gestural
repertoire idiomatic to the squeeze box or concertina. The
designers sought to create a controller that supported ges-
tures associated with an existing musical instrument, “nat-
ural motions associated with playing a squeeze box [con-
certina],” but that avoided the acoustic limitations of that
instrument and also did not rely on augmentation [19]. The
designers eﬀectively attempted to abstract the original in-
strument down to its idiomatic gestures, and then built a
new controller to support and sense those gestures.
Theoretically, this approach provided “the ﬂexibility to
apply the sensory data from these motions and buttons to
any number of sonic parameters” [19]. In practice, however,
although performer’s motions were constrained to the ap-
propriate dimensions, ranges, and axes to facilitate roughly
concertina-like movements, the actual speciﬁc gestures in
Accordiatron performance – trajectories of motion through
Figure 1: Gurevich and von Muehlen’s Accordia-
tron
time and space – were in fact determined by a far more com-
plex set of factors than the physical properties of the instru-
ment. In fact, Accordiatron performances do not generally
involve idiomatic concertina gestures [16]. We can deduce
at least two reasons why this is the case: i) the continuous
sensors measuring hand movements are positional (poten-
tiometers) and not velocity-sensitive; and ii) the mappings
from sensors signals (and by extension, gestures) to sound
were unrelated to those in concertina performance.
We observe that the lack of a requirement to force air
through the bellows in order to activate reeds or sustain
sound results in more static gestures, and furthermore the
decoupling of the ‘stretch’ and ‘rotation’ controls gives rise
to a new gestural vocabulary. Only in the case of a com-
position that employs synthesis algorithms which explicitly
model an energetic input (‘ergotic’ systems in Cadoz’s terms
[4]) and mapping algorithms that inferred velocity from po-
sitional input do Accordiatron gestures begin to resemble
idiomatic concertina gestures.
Although also deriving from the accordion, the SqueezeVox
interestingly takes a very diﬀerent approach, which provides
a useful contrast. Its design was initially motivated by a
particular singing-voice synthesis algorithm. The accordion
was seen as a “natural” interface for a physically informed
synthesis model of the human voice due to the analogies of
breathing and articulation. Cook described the mapping as
follows: “Pitch via the keyboard, vibrato aftertouch, and
a linear strip for ﬁne pitch and vibrato are controlled with
the right hand. Breathing is controlled by the bellows, and
the left hand controls vowels and consonants via buttons
(presets)” [9]. However, of course, the idiomatic gestures
of accordion performance are not obviously related to those
involved in vocal performance. Furthermore, a control in-
terface designed for a massively polyphonic instrument is
mapped onto a monophonic synthesizer. Therefore, perfor-
mances with the SqueezeVox have a hybridizing or chimeric
eﬀect; it is not-quite-accordion and not-quite-voice. At
times accordion-like gestures appear superimposed onto a
vocal performance, and at other times the gestures are quite
novel: diverging greatly from idiomatic accordion gestures
in order to achieve a speciﬁc vocal eﬀects.
5. IDIOMATIC GESTURE STORAGE AND
RETRIEV AL IN NOISA INSTRUMENT
NOISA, the Network of Intelligent Sonic Agents , is an inter-
active performance system with three musical instruments
that are identical in their physical components but diﬀerent

nents.
128
in sonic characteristics (Figure 2). The intelligent part of
the interactive system estimates the musician’s engagement
levels in the moment of performing music with NOISA in-
struments, learns a particular playing technique from the
performer and decides what to do next [37, 38]. The sys-
tem itself provides a musical interaction in which interaction
characteristics have been reﬂected in music compositions,
speciﬁcally to be performed with NOISA system [41]. At
the same time, NOISA instruments aﬀord unique sonic pos-
sibilities to appear, reﬂecting a particular playing technique,
which is idiomatic to the characteristics of the instrument.
Idiomatic properties of the NOISA system ﬁrstly emerge
from its intelligent behaviour that monitors the performer’s
engagement as a state where the performer is connected
and only paying attention to activities related to the music
performance. The system provides autonomous support-
ing counteractions to maintain the performer’s engagement.
These counteractions are specially tailored for that particu-
lar musical interaction with NOISA instruments, which as-
sociate in a seemingly musical-responses based on the com-
plementarity of the performer and the interactive system.
Figure 3: The performance set up of the piece3
agents + 1
The functional aﬀordances of the NOISA instrument in-
volves two handles, proportional in size to human hands, of
which the left-handle works as sound producer, activating
the digital audio processes, and the right-handle regulates
the pitch content, transforming the previous resulting signal
(see Figure 2). The intervals generated as a result of the
pitch shifting algorithm (right hand), simultaneously super-
imposed with the original signal (left hand), contribute to
the richness of the instrument’s overall sound production.
In relation to the functional characteristic of the instrument
a gesture vocabulary is formulated by elaborating a portfo-
lio of two second-long movements of both handles. These
gestures were considered as idiomatic gestures with a fo-
cus on obtaining a wider range of expressive possibilities in
music performances with NOISA instrument.
The idiomatic gesture portfolio of the NOISA instrument
comprises an openness towards possible textural and tempo-
ral expansion similar to a technological implementation of
the widespread composition technique of thematic develop-
ment. Consideration of the possible new patterns to emerge
through the gestural vocabulary resulted in writing com-
positions with a focus on developing dedicated repertoire
for NOISA. The live performance of Vasquez’s composition
NOISA Etude#2 turned towards the music of performer’s
presence and communication with NOISA instruments in
the moment of playing [40]. In this composition, the major
part of the music unfolds in the performer’s intended asso-
ciations, of vague bodily sensations, with variations of the
responsive gestures of the NOISA system. Speciﬁcity, the
variations of the counteraction gestures, shifting from low
responsive to sudden clarity, is highly noted in the perfor-
mance. Investigating the transformation of the second half
of the score (see Figure 4) encounters the possibility of con-
veying the full intention of the performer through construc-
tion of conscious expectation with the musical instrument,
which gives the known characteristics of the performative
gestures as the essence of the instrument.
This gesture catalogue results in musically expressive out-
come in another composition, 3 agents + 1 by Tahiro˘ glu
[36]. In this composition, gestural patterns with short tem-
poral features have been used to construct the discrete events
in the piece with NOISA instrument. Figure 3 shows the live
performance set up of the piece. The composition exploits
what’s possible when NOISA’s idiomatic gestures commu-
nicate with the performer within a ﬂow that is tailored to
the variance and diversities of performer’s actions and re-
sponsive patterns. In the live performance of 3 agents +
1, the idiomaticity characteristics of the gesture vocabulary
emerge in the moment of playing and evolve into individual
performative gestures. These idiomatic gestures incorpo-
rate the performance and become part of the distribution
of decision-making, transforming their predeﬁned vocabu-
lary within own acoustic contexts.

6. DISCUSSION
A gesture vocabulary that is idiomatic to the new musi-
cal instrument establishes a set of playing techniques for
that instrument, which is in turn an essential component of
a developing a performance practice. The three examples
presented in this paper illustrate the complex relationships
between the performers, physical properties of instruments,
behaviours, mappings, and synthesis algorithms, which in-
form the development of idiomatic gestures. Only once such
a repertoire of gestures and techniques has been established
can the individual variations between performances begin
to develop the potential for “expression” or style.
In this context, the idiomatic gesture that gives form to a
sound-producing gesture becomes the underlying basis for
the development of a performer’s style. Revisiting the deﬁ-
nition of gesture as movement imbued with meaning, we ar-
gue that performative gestures have the potential to develop
richer layers of meaning when they are rooted in, related to,
or associated with gestures that are familiar in some way,
whether through tradition, repetition, practice, or extra-
musical reference. The development of style and expression
in traditional musical performance has been accomplished
through the necessary development of idiomatic gestures
129
informed by a similarly complex suite of forces. If NIME
performances are to acquire a semblance of the richness of
meanings through gesture as of those of traditional music
(which, we should be clear, may not and should not always
be the goal of every NIME performance), then consideration
for the development of idiomatic gestures is paramount.
There is an important social dimension to idiomatic ges-
ture as well, through the interaction of the choices, abilities,
and qualities, of the various actors in the social network
around a performance [17], as well through their unique
relationships with the unique aﬀordances of a particular in-
strument. There is an echo here, of course, with the way
idiomatic compositions enhance a shared performance prac-
tice and musical experience. A central theme in our id-
iomatic gesture discussion is the ability to convey the full
intention of the performer through building up conscious
expectations with the musical instrument. Heightened at-
tention to idiomatic gestures could further illuminate the
challenges to the situated interaction we have with musical
instruments, prompting closer collaborations between ac-
tors in the musical-social network. The idiomatic potential
emerges through the relationships of these actors and these
relationships maintain the critical importance of reﬂecting
idiomatic approach in the design of new instruments. The
NOISA project is a signiﬁcant example to such process in
which the instrument designer and composer worked to-
gether from the very early phase of the project [41].
The contrasts evident between the musical instruments
Accordiatron and SqueezeVox reveal that explicit borrow-
ing or adaptation of idiomatic gestures associated with ex-
isting musical instruments can be eﬀective, but only to a
point. Although important, neither the physical form, nor
the range, orientation, and scale of motion alone are suf-
ﬁcient in replicating idiomatic gestures. The mappings of
these features to synthesis algorithms, and of course, the
nature of those algorithms themselves, are shown to be at
least equally important. This is not to say that exact repli-
cation of idiomatic gestures should be a goal, nor was it for
the designers of these instruments. But by examining the
factors that impacted the observed divergence, and which
facilitated the emergence of new gestural repertoires, we
draw attention to important considerations for designers,
performers and composers.
The Accordiatron was explicitly conceived as an instru-
ment that would constrain motion to speciﬁc dimensions
and trajectories. Experience in practice revealed that such
constraints are not in themselves suﬃcient to determine id-
iomatic gestures. Indeed, in contrast, biocontrollers reveal
an especially challenging but enlightening complementary
perspective: interfaces with no speciﬁc external constraints
on movement. In the absence of such physical constraints,
these systems demonstrate that idiomatic gestures can be
speciﬁcally composed, for example through reference to ex-
tramusical activities, or through induction of emotional or
aﬀective states. This suggests a counter-intuitive tipping
of the balance of forces in the development of idiomatic
gestures away from the physical instrument design in iso-
lation, and toward socially- and culturally-situated forces.
For example, it is interesting to ponder what combination of
composer, performer, and instrument designer would choose
whether to use MMG or EMG in a piece that contemplates
using muscle measurement for control. Would the choice be
based on the repertoire of gestures that are available within
the lexicon of current performers? (A lexicon that is not
identical between EMG and MMG [6].) Would the choice
matter if the gestures chosen are ones that are idiomatic to
both sensor systems?
The case of NOISA suggests that programming—beyond
the static physical properties of the instrument—can play a
more active role in determining playing techniques and id-
iomatic gestures with computer-based instrument. In par-
ticular, algorithms that can learn and adapt to performers’
gestures allow this process to happen in dialogue with the
performer, thus widening the network of social inﬂuences.
Perhaps this socially-situated context around idiomatic
gestures should not be surprising if we consider the complex
interplay of cultural, musical, and technological factors that
inform the wide variety of idiomatic gestures involved in the
performance of traditional musical instruments. In violin
performance, for example, compare the seated position with
the scroll resting against the player’s heel in Carnatic music
[33] and the complex bowing patterns of Irish ﬁddling [14].
Furthermore, thenon-idiomatic gestures revealed through
experiences with biocontrollers highlight the essential situ-
atedness of interactive performances. Gestures that might
otherwise convey meaning may not be idiomatic for a par-
ticular individual, interface, sound environment, or even
a moment of a composition. These various types of id-
iomatic gestures are not only static or dynamic represen-
tations of sound producing gestures; performer, composer,
instrument designer simultaneously deﬁnes the idiomaticity
and extends its usage in the performance.
7. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have introduced the concept of idiomatic
gestures with new musical instruments. The development of
a repertoire of gestures that are idiomatic to a new instru-
ment contributes to the emergence of style, expression, and
extramusical meaning in performance. We argue that the
explicit consideration of idiomatic gestures in a NIME can
shift its reception from one with a focus on purely novelty
in terms of sounds or controls toward that of a more es-
tablished, performative musical instrument. The three par-
ticular projects presented demonstrate diverse ways that
idiomatic gestures emerge in performance practice. The
historical perspective, both in the classical era and in the
NIME period, provides evidence that building an idiomatic
gesture repertoire for a musical instrument is potentially
crucial to the full realization of expressive possibilities.
