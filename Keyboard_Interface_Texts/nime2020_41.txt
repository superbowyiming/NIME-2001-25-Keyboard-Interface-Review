ABSTRACT
Research on Accessible Digital Musical Instruments (AD-
MIs) has received growing attention over the past decades,
carving out an increasingly large space in the literature. De-
spite the recent publication of state-of-the-art review works,
there are still few systematic studies on ADMIs design anal-
ysis. In this paper we propose a formal tool to explore the
main design aspects of ADMIs based on Dimension Space
Analysis, a well established methodology in the NIME lit-
erature which allows to generate an eﬀective visual repre-
sentation of the design space. We therefore propose a set
of relevant dimensions, which are based both on categories
proposed in recent works in the research context, and on
original contributions. We then proceed to demonstrate its
applicability by selecting a set of relevant case studies, and
analyzing a sample set of ADMIs found in the literature.

1. INTRODUCTION
Digital musical instruments (DMI) have the potential for
augmented accessibility with respect to traditional ones.
Thanks to the exponential increase of computational power,
miniaturization, and available sensors, research on DMIs
has expanded during the last two decades [16] into the use
of non-conventional interaction paradigms, interfaces and
physical channels.
The term “accessible DMIs” (ADMIs) is often used to
refer to instruments designed for persons with disabilities.
The terms “assistive music technologies” [8] and “adaptive
music technologies” [9] have also been used. All these def-
initions bring about slightly diﬀerent meanings. The word
“assistive” implies an external source (technology) that pro-
vides aid to a person with disabilities to complete a task

(e.g., TTS can help a visually-impaired user to read a text).
In contrast, the word “adaptive” emphasizes the ability of
the instrument to adjust to the context and to the situa-
tion of the musician. In the remainder of this paper we use
the term ADMI, in order to emphasize aspects related to
inclusion and universal design. Nonetheless, the concept of
adaptability remains a central property of accessible instru-
ments, as discussed next.
ADMIs and related works in the context of accessible
interfaces have carved out an important niche within the
literature, including NIME (some recent examples are pro-
vided by [35, 19, 24, 21]). As indicated by Frid [8] in her
review work, several initiatives and charity organizations fo-
cusing on these topics were born in recent years, as well as
several companies producing ADMIs and having inclusive
music practices at the core of their mission.
Accessible instruments are designed and created for dif-
ferent contexts, health conditions, and impairments. The
beneﬁts of providing access to music to persons with disabil-
ities have been discussed in many of the works mentioned
above, and include rehabilitation, social inclusion, personal
expression, physical and psychological wellbeing. Cappele n
and Anderson [4] refer to the ensemble of activities enabled
by music access through the word “musicking” , originally
coined by Small [33, 4]) to subsume all the activities re-
lated to music.
Despite the publication of studies dedicated reviewing the
state-of-the-art of ADMIs [8, 19, 9, 25], there is still a lack of
contributions towards a systematic analysis of the most im-
portant dimensions of their design. As an example, Frid [8]
categorizes instrument reviewed in her work in terms of con-
trol interface type (tangibles, wearables, gaze-based, etc.),
for the purpose of making statistics on the literature.
The goal of this paper is to contribute to the advancement
of this research direction by proposing a more comprehen-
sive framework for evaluating and classifying a broad range
of ADMIs. In doing so, we discuss a set of relevant require-
ments and design choices for this class of instruments. Sec-
tion 2 presents the chosen analysis framework (dimension
space analysis) and proposes a dimension space speciﬁcally
devoted to ADMIs. Section 3 and 4 discuss the dimensions
associated to the proposed space. Finally, Sec. 5 presents a
small set of case studies, that help exemplifying the appli-
cability of the proposed framework to existing ADMIs.
2. PROPOSED DIMENSION SP ACE
Several approaches have been proposed to classify and eval-
uate the main design aspects of a broad range of “musi-
cal devices” (musical instruments, interactive installations,
games, and so on) [34, 28, 30]). Among them, the dimen-
sion space analysis proposed by Birnbaumet al. [1] is par-
ticularly appealing both for its applicability to a variety of
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020
214
contexts and for the eﬀectiveness of dimension plots, which
allow to visualize and rapidly compare musical devices along
a set of design dimensions.
Birnbaum empirically observed that the functionality of a
space is not aﬀected in plots with as many as eight axes, and
proposed seven dimensions for analyzing musical devices in
their broadest meaning: Required Expertise, representing
the level of practice of the performer; Musical Control, spec-
ifying the level of musical control exerted by the performer;
Degrees of Freedom, indicating the number of input con-
trols available to a user; Feedback Modalities, specifying
the degree to which a system provides real-time feedback;
Inter-actors, representing the number of people involved in
the musical interaction; Distribution in Space, indicating
the total physical area in which the interaction takes place;
Role of Sound, representing the category of sound role (with
three main values: artistic/expressive, environmental, and
informational).
The ﬂexibility of the dimension space approach lies in
the ability to redeﬁne the axes. In fact, alternative repre-
sentations have been proposed: Magnusson [22] presented
an “epistemic” dimension space, as opposed to the more
“phenomenological” Birnbaum space. Some other authors
proposed more specialized spaces, aimed at evaluating spe-
ciﬁc categories of musical devices: Hattwick and Wander-
ley [12] presented a dimension space for evaluating collab-
orative music performance systems. In a similar fashion,
H¨odl and Fitzpatrick [13] targeted hand-controlled guitar
eﬀects for live music and described a related design space.
Following these examples, here we resort to the dimension
space analysis approach to propose a new space dedicated
to ADMIs. The aim of this eﬀort is to reﬂect on the dimen-
sions that deﬁne their design space and to oﬀer a tool for
labeling, discussing, and evaluating such instruments. As
such, the proposed space is not intended as an alternative
representation to the one designed by Birnbaum, but rather
as a ﬁner layer of description devoted to a speciﬁc class of
instruments. Therefore, a complete description of a single
ADMI could be obtained by classifying it both along the
seven-axis Birnbaum space and along the eight-axis space
proposed in this work. The two descriptions are comple-
mentary, as discussed in the remainder of the paper.
The eight-axis conﬁguration resulting from our analysis is
shown in Fig. 1. The eight axes can be conceptually grouped
into two subsets: the four axes in the lower part of the plot
(labeled in blue) relate to the intended target users and to
the use contexts of the instrument, while those in the upper
part of the plot (labeled in green) are related to the design
choices of the instrument. These groups reﬂect two distinct
phases of the design of an ADMI, where the ﬁrst one is
more related to preliminary deﬁnition of requirements, and
the second one is concerned with subsequent choices in the
design. We discuss these two subset of axes in Secs. 3 and 4,
respectively.
3. T ARGET USERS AND USE CONTEXTS
In this section we discuss the four axes in the lower half of
the proposed dimension space (see Fig. 1).
Disability is a “complex multidimensional experience” [38]
which poses challenges for measurement and classiﬁcation.
In the “International Classiﬁcation of Functioning, Disabil-
ity and Health” (ICF) [37], the World Health Organization
categorizes problems with human functioning in three inter-
connected areas:impairments are problems in body func-
tion or alterations in body structure, and are often identiﬁed
as symptoms or signs of health conditions;activity limita-
tions are diﬃculties in executing speciﬁc activities; partic-

ipation restrictions are problems with involvement in any
area of life. Disability refers to diﬃculties encountered in
any or all these three areas of functioning.
The Washington Group on Disability Statistics [38, p.26],
an international, consultative group of experts aimed at
facilitating the measurement of disability, applies an ICF-
based approach which covers six functional domains or basic
actions: seeing, hearing, mobility, cognition, self-care, and
communication.
In the context of human-computer interfaces, Jacko et
al. [31, Ch.43] proposed a conceptual scheme aimed at deﬁn-
ing categories of impairments and their relation to the use
of interactive technologies. Speciﬁcally the authors con-
sidered ﬁve broad categories: (a) hearing impairments, (b)
mental impairments, (c) physical impairments, (d) speech
impairments, and (e) visual impairments. Each is composed
of a collection of related clinical diagnoses which, in turn,
inﬂuence certain functional capabilities that are critical to
accessing speciﬁc classes of technologies.
For the purposes of this work, categories of impairments
are further clustered into three main axes: physical, cogni-
tive, sensory (or perceptual). These three broad categories
are often employed in the literature of accessible HCI [31,
Ch.41-44]. Previous reviews on ADMIs [8, 25, 20] suggest
that target user groups can be classiﬁed into these three
categories. Moreover, the multidimensional character of
disability also means that physical, sensory, and cognitive
impairments are often intertwined.
Usually, ADMIs aimed at musicians with physical im-
pairment are designed to address a speciﬁc degree of motor
ability. With a handful of exceptions (the harmonica, the
kazoo, and possibly a few more), traditional musical instru-
ments include upper limbs (hands and ﬁngers in particular)
among their physical interaction channels, with the possible
addition of the feet (used for example to control pedals and
foot switches), and breath. Consequently, this axis indicates
the level of motor impairment addressed by the instrument
along a discrete scale of ﬁve points, each representing the
minimum motor skill level required by the instrument. The
rationale behind this classiﬁcation is that instruments de-
voted to higher levels of impairment can potentially be used
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020
215
also for lower levels of impairment. The proposed levels are
as follows (see Searset al. [31, Ch. 42] for an overview of
related health conditions and traumas):
1. Uncompromised motor skills (NC) - Includes instru-
ments dedicated to fully motor skilled users, therefore
aimed at other types of impairments.
2. Lightly compromised motor skills (LC) - Includes in-
struments for users who do not have full control of (or
have diﬃculty controlling) limbs. This could be given
by cerebral palsy, heart attack, and other conditions.
3. Heavily compromised motor skills (HC) - Includes in-
struments dedicated to people who have at least one
limb completely compromised, unable (or almost com-
pletely unable) to move. DMIs dedicated to users with
situations such as hemiplegic paralysis or paraplegia
belong to this category.
4. Quadriplegic paralysis (QP) - Includes instruments ded-
icated to people who no longer control upper and lower
limbs. These instruments can take advantage of in-
teraction channels available from the neck upwards
(face muscles tension, gaze, brain frequencies, breath,
etc.) [5].
5. Lock-in syndrome (LI) - This is a condition in which a
person is awake and conscious but can only move his
eyes. This category includes instruments that use only
eye based interaction (e.g. gaze-based or blink-based),
or electroencephalogram (EEG) based interaction.
Frid [8] remarks that a very limited amount of existing
ADMIs are speciﬁcally designed for users with sensory im-
pairments. As an example, only 3.6% of the 83 instru-
ments reviewed in her work focused on persons with visual
impairments, while 6.0% focused on persons with hearing
impairments. This is therefore a research direction that
needs to be further explored. The corresponding axis in the
proposed dimension space indicates the level of sensory im-
pairment addressed by the instrument. Unlike the physical
impairment axis, this is a continuous axis ranging in value
from low to high levels of impairment. The reason for this
choice is that diﬀerent or multiple types of sensory impair-
ments may be addressed, which makes impossible to deﬁne
a unique discrete scale of levels.
The cognitive impairment axis may include several dif-
ferent target groups, such as children with special educa-
tional needs (SEN), learning and developmental diﬃculties,
behavioral disorders, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as
well as elderly people with aging-related losses of cognitive
abilities, and persons with severe intellectual deﬁcits lacking
conceptual and/or communication skills. In the literature,
reference is often made to four levels of intellectual impair-
ment (mild, moderate, severe, profound) [2, 14, 26], ranging
from situations in which the person is able to learn practi-
cal skills and communicate, to scenarios in which the person
does not have any degree of autonomy and independence.
However these categories are not easily related to musical
abilities: for this reason, in the proposed dimension space
this is a continuous axis ranging in value from low to high
levels of impairment.
The fourth and last axis in the lower half of the proposed
dimension space is related to the use context for which
the instrument is intended. Regardless of the type(s) of
impairment of the target users, deﬁning the context of use
inﬂuences all the subsequent design choices. Harrison and
McPherson [11] make a distinction between two broad cat-
egories of ADMIs. On one side, “therapeutic devices” are
meant to provide a means for persons with disabilities to
enjoy the health, social and psychological beneﬁts of music
making, demonstrated by music therapy practices. Instru-
ments in this class often have a low-barrier to expressive
music making, and work particularly well in group music
workshop contexts, or as part of music therapy sessions.
On the other hand, the category of “performance-focused in-
struments” refers to instruments which allow the performer
to reach high levels of expression and virtuosity, similarly
to traditional instruments for able-bodied performers. In-
struments in this category often require larger amounts of
practice and are particularly suited for inclusive music per-
formance contexts, such as orchestras accessible to perform-
ers with disabilities.
It has to be noted that therapy and performance are not
mutually exclusive use contexts and may co-exist in the de-
sign of an ADMI. Therefore, in the proposed dimension
spaceuse context is a continuous axis ranging in value
from therapy to performance, depending on the aims of the
instrument.
4. DESIGN CHOICES
Having deﬁned the potential target groups and the use con-
texts of the instrument, the remaining dimensions relate
to fundamental choices in the design of the ADMI. These
can strengthen some aspects of inclusion rather than oth-
ers, inﬂuencing the accessible qualities of the instrument.
By analyzing previous works in the literature, we extracted
four dimensions of design which are especially relevant for
accessibility. These are represented in the upper half of the
proposed dimension space (see Fig. 1) and are discussed
next.
Adaptability has long become a key concept in the ﬁeld
of accessible HCI. When designing for persons with disabil-
ities, every user has diﬀerent and individual requirements
and needs, and adaptive interfaces have the potential for ac-
commodating a wide range of users. Jackoet al. [31, Ch.43]
discuss several adaptive interfaces in the context of sensory
impairments. An analysis of the ADMI literature shows
that existing instruments generally allow for limited adapt-
ability to the speciﬁc needs of an individual user. Thus, this
remains one of the ultimate challenges in this context, as ac-
knowledged by various scholars [8, 19, 6]. Some instruments
may include the possibility of customizing parts of the in-
terface and instrumental features. However a deeper form
of adaptability should be based on user models with respect
to their abilities and should consequently include the possi-
bility of modifying the interface, the employed interaction
channels, and the musical mappings. An emerging trend
amounts to using interactive machine learning techniques in
order for an instrument to learn preferred or idiosyncratic
gestures of an individual user, and to map the learned ges-
tures to musical parameters. A notable related example
is the Wekinator software [7], in which various supervised
machine learning approaches are used to build musical map-
pings through training examples. Interestingly, this sofware
has been used in a recent project aimed at building cus-
tomized musical rehabilitation devices for children with se-
vere motor impairments [17].
Regarding the design novelty of the instrument, a dis-
tinction can be drawn between instruments that are de-
signed from scratch having persons with disabilities as tar-
get users, and adaptations of existing instruments. The
deﬁnition “adapted instrument” is often used to refer to a
modiﬁcation of a traditional or pre-existing instrument, ob-
tained through either mechanical, electroacoustic, or digital
means: in this case the focus is thus shifted towards the
“assistive” facet of technology. On the other hand, in the
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020
216
case of completely novel instruments the focus is shifted to-
wards the “accessible” facet of technology, which calls for
cyclical, participatory design approaches that only recently
started to enter the mainstream of DMI research [23]. Sim-
ilarly to some of the axes discussed above, there is a contin-
uum of possibilities in between these two dichotomic alter-
natives. As an example ADMIs employing existing control
metaphors (e.g., the piano keyboard) may be assigned an
intermediate rank along this axis. Tending towards one of
the two extremes of this axis depends on the target users
and contexts of use. Although a completely novel interface
may possibly better accommodate the necessities of persons
with disabilities, oﬀering the possibility to play a traditional
instrument may provide an added value for inclusive music
practices.
The usability and the expressivity of the instrument are
largely aﬀected by the amount of physical channels that
the user can employ in the interaction. This axis thus re-
lates to the number of motor skills needed by the user. Ex-
amples are ﬁnger movements, breath, EEG features, head
movements, gaze pointing, etc. These in turn are related
to the types and levels of impairments, especially physical
ones, but also sensory and cognitive ones. This axis has
some relation with the “Degrees of Freedom” dimension in-
dicated in the space for generic musical devices. However,
that axis indicates the “number of input controls” and is
thus focused on the sound production unit of the instru-
ment; on the other hand, this axis shifts the focus to the
perspective of the users and their functioning.
The fourth and last axis in the lower half of the proposed
dimension space is related to the degree of simpliﬁcation
designed into the instrument. The word “simpliﬁcation” in
this context is once more borrowed from the literature of
accessible HCI, where it is often used to refer to simpli-
ﬁed interfaces aimed at reducing the cognitive load and/or
simplifying motor actions required to complete a task [31,
Ch.23]. However, here we use this term in a wider sense: the
degree of simpliﬁcation of an ADMI along this axis refers
to all the aspects of the instrument design aimed at aiding
the user in completing musical tasks. These may include en-
larging of elements of the visual interface, but also temporal
quantization of musical events to compensate for rhythmic
diﬃculties, simpliﬁed gestures to play chords or arpeggios,
etc. Related concepts have been investigated in the context
of DMIs for novices and non-musicians (beginning with the
“low entry fee with no ceiling on virtuosity” claim by Wes-
sel and Wright [36]), and are discussed by McPherson et
al. [25]. Correspondingly, the Birnbaum space includes the
dimension “Required expertise” . Here, however, the focus
is not on user expertise, but rather on user abilities and
on the related design simpliﬁcations aimed at providing an
engaging and rewarding experience.
As a ﬁnal remark, it has to be noted that the adapt-
ability axis plays a special role in the deﬁnition of the
space, as it can aﬀect the remaining dimensions related to
design choices. As an example, a high level of adaptability
may imply that the instrument can address various levels of
physical impairments, or be equally suited to music therapy
contexts and to performance contexts through ad-hoc setup
changes, and so on. Therefore, in the case of an instrument
with highadaptability it would be recommended to clas-
sify it according to the most common use case, or provide
a judgment that reﬂects the maximum level attained for a
given axis.
5. CASE STUDIES
In this section we review 8 ADMIs, including academic
projects, commercial products, and non-academic projects
funded through charity programs. All the chosen instru-
ments appear in at least one recent reviews of ADMIs [8,
25, 20, 5]. The purpose is to demonstrate the applicability of
the proposed space to the analysis of existing instruments,
and to provide further discussion on its dimensions.
Figure 2 presents the visualization of the ADMIs in the
dimension space. The plots show that each of the reviewed
instruments scores extreme (high or low) values along at
least one axis. In fact, each instrument has been chosen
because it is especially relevant to discuss at least one of
the 8 dimensions.
Examples of ADMIs focused on physical impairments abound
in the literature. Miranda and coworkers developed several
Brain-Computer Music Interfaces (BCMI). One in partic-
ular [27] (Fig. 2a) was speciﬁcally designed for users with
severe motor impairments, and was tested with a patient
with Locked-in Syndrome. The instrument allows for real-
time generation of melodic lines through a reactive brain-
computer interface based on steady-state visual evoked po-
tentials (SSVEPs).
In contrast to the above, as already discussed, relatively
little work has been done regarding instruments for per-
sons withsensory impairments . One interesting example is
provided by Grierson [10], who developed an interactive au-
diovisual performance system for hearing impaired persons
( “Making Music With Images” , MMWI hereafter, Fig. 2b).
The system visualizes sound in real-time to allow hearing
impaired individuals to interact with an experiential rep-
resentation of sound. The author foresees its use in re-
habilitation mainly, but collaborative performance are also
considered as a possible use context.
One notable example with a strong focus on cognitive
impairments is provided by WamBam [15] (Fig. 2c). This
is a self-contained electronic hand-drum meant for severely
intellectually disabled users. It is shaped as a dome made of
various soft pads with diﬀerent colors and textures, which
provide acoustic and vibrotactile feedback when touched.
The authors foresee applications in music therapy sessions
mainly, but discuss potential uses also in the context of
musical performance.
Unlike the previous instruments, the MINWii project [3]
(Fig. 2d) is conceived and designed exclusively as a ther-
apeutic instrument . It is a music game which lets players
improvise or play songs by pointing at a virtual keyboard
with color-coded keys, using a Wiimote Pistol. Diﬀerent im-
plementations of the system were used both with children
suﬀering from behavioral disorders and with elderly patients
suﬀering from mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, also taking into account possible related motor im-
pairments.
The Skoog [32] (Fig. 2e) is a commercial DMI which is
presented as a “tactile instrument” and consists of tangible
interface that can be paired with a compatible mobile de-
vice. The interaction metaphor is loosely based on a drum
instrument, and provides an example of extremesimpliﬁ-
cation, as potentially complex musical events are produced
by pressing on one of ﬁve colour-coded buttons. The instru-
ment is said to be used both for performance and therapy,
in particular it is used with children with SEN and ASD, as
well as individuals with physical impairments.
One of the few examples of ADMIs with a high degree of
adaptability is provided by the Clarion [29] (Fig. 2f). This
is an instrument developed through a long-term charity pro-

gram, with the goal of allowing performers with physical im-
pairments to play in an orchestra. It has a strong emphasis
on participatory design, interface adaptability to individual
needs, and exploitation of oﬀ-the shelf assistive technologies
used by persons with disabilities in their everyday lives. It
can use various alternative physical channels, including gaze
pointing and head movements, depending on the type and
level of individual impairment, but can also be played with
the ﬁngers or the feet.
Harrison and McPherson [11] present a system for adapt-
ing the bass guitar for one-handed musicians (Fig. 2g). Pos-
sibly not a DMI in a strict sense, this may be regarded as an
assistive technology that enables bass guitar playing by per-
formers users with upper-limb impairments. Speciﬁcally, it
enables MIDI-controlled actuated fretting via a foot pedal
control. As such, this project provides a notable example of
an adapted traditional instrument along theDesign Novelty
dimension.
BioMuse [18] (Fig. 2h) is a pioneering project which un-
derwent several implementations, all having at their core a
HW/SW developed speciﬁcally to collect electroencephalo-
graphic, electrooculographic, and electromyographic signals
from a large number ofphysical channels . These are then
processed to extract a set of relevant features and map those
to MIDI events. BioMuse has been used to augment tradi-
tional musical instrument performance or as a stand-alone
DMI, in the latter case being suitable also for performers
with physical impairments.
6. CONCLUSIONS
We have shown a possible dimension space for ADMIs de-
sign analysis, demonstrating its descriptive potential through
the analysis of some state-of-the-art instruments.
There is often little information about the availability of
technologies in disability related contexts. In addition to
being a conceptual design tool, the dimension space we pro-
pose could prove to be a classiﬁcation and categorization aid
suitable for searching in catalogs. Assuming to search an in-
strument suitable for a speciﬁc musician’s condition into a
database of classiﬁed ADMIs, the system could allow quick
access to a list of proper instruments.
However, the system we propose certainly has limitations
in the ﬁeld of classiﬁcation: it does not reﬂect all the pos-
sible parameters and all the ADMI classiﬁcation systems
presented in past literature, nor does it provide a complete
deﬁnition of ADMI design choices. There are some highly
categorical variables (e.g. related to sensors choice) that
can hardly be inserted in a web chart like this.
Future works could be aimed at using this system in new
case studies to verify its eﬃciency, as well as cataloging new
instruments to highlight other design trends within the lit-
erature. New works about the relationship between impair-
ments and musical abilities could lead to a better deﬁnition
of the three axesCognitive impairment, Perceptual impair-
ment and Physical impairment , or to their discretization.
