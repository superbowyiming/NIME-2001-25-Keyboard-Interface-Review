ABSTRACT
Taking inspiration from research into deliberately constrained
musical technologies and the emergence of neurodiverse,
child-led musical groups such as the Artism Ensemble, the
interplay between design-constraints, inclusivity and appro-
priation is explored. A small scale review covers systems
from two prominent UK-based companies, and two itera-
tions of a new prototype system that were developed in
collaboration with a small group of young people on the
autistic spectrum. Amongst these technologies, the aspects
of musical experience that are made accessible diﬀer with re-
spect to the extent and nature of each system’s constraints.
It is argued that the design-constraints of the new prototype
system facilitated the diverse playing styles and techniques
observed during its development. Based on these obser-
vations, we propose that deliberately constrained musical
instruments may be one way of providing more opportuni-
ties for the emergence of personal practices and preferences
in neurodiverse groups of children and young people, and
that this is a ﬁtting subject for further research.

1. INTRODUCTION
Proponents of the social model of disability and the neuro-
diversity movement have argued that disability is socially
constructed, that there is a pressing need for greater rep-
resentation, quality of life, agency, and for the acceptance
of neurological diﬀerence as another aspect of human vari-
ation [11, 15, 16]. Pullin makes the related argument that
the inclusion of more artistic, critical and radical practices
in design for disability would beneﬁt designers and disabled
users alike through an increase in choice and creative op-
portunity [14]. There has been a recent increase in projects
that have aimed to put these values into practice, creating

opportunities for neurodiverse groups of young people to
meaningfully shape the musical direction of the groups they
perform in. The Artism Ensemble is one such example, led
by a group of young autistic musicians, in which participat-
ing neurotypical adults were often pushed out of aesthetic
comfort zone, being “asked to play things and play in ways
that defy their ‘common sense’musical sensibilities” [1, 2].
What an ensemble like this shows is that there is an emerg-
ing need for a) musical instruments that are open enough
to support these contexts, and b) resources that support
adults in reaching a better understanding of the preferences
and practices of individuals within neurodiverse groups. We
believe that amongst existing musical resources, questions
of artistic choice and the meaningful appropriation of in-
struments could be explored further with respect to neu-
rodiverse children and young people. The “least dangerous
assumption” [5] that can be made is that in an inclusive
environment with the right tools, every person would be
capable of exploring and appropriating an instrument, pro-
vided they wanted to do so.
As we will discuss, commercially available accessible in-
struments tend to oﬀer a high degree of choice and conﬁg-
urability, if set up by a facilitator. These instruments could
be considered products of ability-based design approaches
[25], as their adaptability places a focus on users’abilities
rather than disabilities. The complexity of such resources,
however, can be daunting for facilitators, and in the worst
cases may preclude the use of these instruments in schools
[24, 23]. Furthermore, the need for conﬁguration by a fa-
cilitator may place aesthetic constraints on some users, in-
hibiting deeper engagement with a DMI [9], and leading to
“involuntarily relinquished”[23] choices being made on their
behalf.
The above are the themes that have underpinned Wright’s
research, exploring the usefulness of moderately incongru-
ent interaction-design [26], and more recently, the provision
of accessible choices for sounds and interaction styles in the
design of prototype digital musical instruments (DMIs). Al-
though not a direct topic in his research, constraints have
become an increasingly dominant theme in the evaluation
and testing of these prototypes.
The signiﬁcant role of constraints in this area is not sur-
prising. As Norman [12] discusses, physical, cultural, se-
mantic and logical constraints can be used to inform a user
how to correctly interact with a design. Constraints in this
sense assume some degree of commonality of experience in
the world and that there is a correct mode of use for a de-
vice, but this may not always be the case in inclusive musi-
cal contexts. The aﬀordances of an instrument (the actions
available to an agent based on an interaction between an
object’s physical qualities and the abilities of the agent [7])
will be aﬀected by diﬀerences in the ways that neurodiverse
162
people interact with the world. As the example of the Ar-
tism Ensemble revealed, young neurodiverse musicians may
also have diﬀerent ideas of what is musically ‘correct’.
At their extremes, however, constraints in the design of
musical instruments may circumvent such problems: requir-
ing little in the way of technical demand or conﬁguration,
giving rise to “playful aesthetics”[3], and oﬀering relief from
the complexities of more sophisticated musical tools [10].
Even the simplest one-button instruments have been shown
to give rise to very individual performance strategies in
which users explored hidden aﬀordances, often turning in-
cidental physical attributes into expressive musical features
[8]. Similarly, Zappi & McPherson’s [28] study on dimen-
sionality and appropriation found that the diversity in users’
responses decreased when groups were given an extra degree
of freedom (DoF) in the control over a DMIs output. This
introduced the idea of dominant constraints, in which the
nature of a particular constraint becomes the focus of user’s
attentions, reducing the likelihood of creative appropria-
tion and the discovery of hidden aﬀordances. Constrained
DMIs of this kind are of great relevance to inclusive mu-
sical contexts, emphasizing the “individual approaches and
attitudes” [8] of individuals, and minimizing the need for
training and support.
2. APPROACH TO THE REVIEW
Our small-scale review of inclusive DMIs has the following
aims: to identify the nature and extent of any constraints
among these instruments, and to explore how these con-
straints might render aspects of musical performance more
or less accessible. We focus our discussion on technologies
from two companies — Skoog Music[17, 18] and Sound-
beam [6, 20], chosen for their prominence in SEND schools
across the UK [24] — and contrast them with Wright’s own
prototype instruments for sonic-play. The DMIs are con-
sidered from the point at which they are conﬁgured for use,
but as some of these systems are highly conﬁgurable, how-
ever, multiple use-cases will be discussed. By considering
these instruments from the point of conﬁguration, we place
our focus on those aspects of each musical system that all
individuals within neurodiverse groups will have creative
control over in their musical practice. Our review of each
instrument or system is conducted with the following three
points of focus: one, user input; two, intended usage; and
three, constraints in primary use cases. Point one consid-
ers the engagement with the input-stage of a system and
the ways that a system relates physical gestures with us-
able data. Point two establishes the intended or imagined
use-cases of the instrument. For the commercially available
instruments, this is established through a survey of promo-
tional/instructional material on each company’s YouTube
channel, which demonstrate the ways in which the design-
ers of these devices feel they can or should be used. Point
three explores the degree of constraint or complexity for
each use-case, and the extent to which there is potential for
a user to appropriate the instrument as part of a creative
practice. We do so using the concepts of hidden aﬀordances,
degrees of freedom, physical constraints and dominant con-
straints as described above. We will also introduce our own
term: stylistic constraint.
3. SOUNDBEAM 6
The Soundbeam 6 system comprises a central touchscreen
computer, which is controlled through some combination of
ultrasonic beams and wireless switches [6, 20]. The com-
puter comes pre-loaded with ‘sound-sets’“that range from
tracks which allow the exploration and performance of dif-
ferent genres” [20]. General setup of the beam sensors and
switches, as well as selecting and creating new sound-sets
is potentially diﬃcult for users with complex needs, and so
this is typically done by a music facilitator. In such cases,
users are removed from the conﬁguration process, stymieing
full appropriation of the system.
The accessible parts of the system are the beams and
switches, essentially an array of one-dimensional controls
and triggers that can be conﬁgured in a number of ways.
The wired beams are typically ﬁxed to stands, and translate
the distance between it and an occluding object to a quan-
tized pitch parameter in a pre-conﬁgured synth. The beams
can also be conﬁgured as trigger-and-hold controllers; the
user breaks the beam and a musical tone from a pre-deﬁned
sequence is generated. The system’s switches work in a
similar fashion, requiring the user to press a switch pad
to trigger one shot samples, loops, note-sequences or chord-
progressions. At this stage we can already identify designed
constraints in the Soundbeam system, which is perhaps its
greatest strength. As each of its input devices have one
DoF, the system is very open to great variety of physical
gestures.
At the time of writing, our survey of Soundbeam’s You-
Tube account [21] covered 91 videos. Of these, 48 showed
a recent iteration of the Soundbeam system in use. The
following conﬁgurations were common: the user is using the
beams only (58%); both beams and switches are available
to user (56%). Only two videos featured the use of switches
without the beam sensor, and as such, they will not be
considered on their own.
The Soundbeam system demonstrates a number of dom-
inant constraints in the way a user controls sounds with
the beams and switches. Every video on the company’s
YouTube channel demonstrates the beams being quantized
and mapped to an equal-tempered scale. This leaves no
way for the user to explore the ‘notes in between’, or other
ways of relating with pitch. This tonal restriction of the
beams alone is likely to become a salient feature, where
the pitch-constraints become the primary concern for the
user, reducing available “cognitive bandwidth”[28] for other
forms of exploration with the system. Once the switches are
added, the restricted control over set harmonic, structural
and melodic material is likely to become a yet more domi-
nant constraint.
The system oﬀers almost no secondary sensory stimuli:
the user has no physical contact with the beam sensor, and
the switches have minimal physical travel and visual feed-
back. With few physical features to explore, combined with
the probability of dominant musical constraints, it is doubt-
ful that a user would have much opportunity to explore
hidden aﬀordances with either beams or switches. Fur-
thermore, the lack of contact with the beams when con-
ﬁgured as a scalar instrument places a very high demand
on a persons accuracy of movement. This is clearly seen
in the “Soundbeam 6 Demonstration” video [21], where the
demonstrator’s linear arm movements result in erratic, non-
linear glissandi. These jagged melodies are characteristic of
the Soundbeam system.
In spite of Soundbeam’s openness to a very wide range
of physical gestures from users, it is far less open in other
respects. The system’s sound-sets provide the user with
a range of musical genres that can be conﬁgured for them,
though musically these may be considered as pastiche rather
than allowing the user to fully explore their own musical cre-
ativity and interpretation of those genres. What is oﬀered
is perhaps based on an assumption of what the user wants
or should be trying to achieve musically, denying the possi-
bility of failiure. When this is combined with the dominant
163
pitch constraints, lack of scope for hidden aﬀordances, and
an erratic melodic ﬁngerprint, the overall eﬀect is to con-
strain the gestures of users into a highly pre-determined set
of musical outcomes. We identify this lack of expressive
and creative opportunity as a stylistic constraint, where dif-
ferences in a user’s approach will do little to inﬂuence the
nature of a system’s output.
4. SKOOG & SKWITCH
The Skoog is a cuboid musical interface which communi-
cates wirelessly with sound-making apps on mobile devices
and computers [18]. Inside the Skoog is a 6-DoF sensor
that detects linear and torsional movement in all directions
[22]. Visually, however, it appears as a cubic array of ﬁve
rounded buttons arranged around the outward and upper
faces of the interface. The Skoog’s layout and pliable mate-
rials will likely aﬀord some kind of physical interaction for
most users. In spite of the higher complexity of the inter-
face, omnidirectional sensor also allows the Skoog to rec-
ognize a very broad range of gestures. This is again made
possible by the conﬁguration of its sensitivity and sounds
in a companion app.
At the time of writing, the Skoogmusic YouTube channel
had a total of 233 videos, 181 featuring the Skoog in use [19].
On the basis of these videos, we have identiﬁed the following
key use-cases for the instrument: keyboard conﬁguration,
where each face of the Skoog is given a diﬀerent note (83%)
or sample (9%); sound conﬁguration, where the instrument
is perceived to have one composite-sound (18%); and single-
button conﬁguration (2%), where only one of the Skoog’s
faces was active. We include this last conﬁguration here, in
spite of its low representation, as it bears great relevance to
the ideas of constraint that we wish to discuss.
Keyboard Conﬁguration. In this conﬁguration, the
Skoog has ﬁve active faces, each assigned to a diﬀerent
note or sample, a loose analogue of a keyboard-style in-
terface. When used with the system’s native instrument
sound-sets, physical models provide a complex relationship
between users’gestures and sounds. Press gestures on a face
will increase the volume of a note, while additional gestures
(twisting/squeezing) will modify the Skoog’s timbre. The
control of samples in this conﬁguration is simpler: each face
triggers a sample, and the volume at which they are played
again increases with pressure.
The function of the instrument in this case becomes mel-
odic, particularly when tuned to ﬁve notes and set against
an ensemble or backing track. This makes the Skoog is
an excellent interface for accessible melody making, yet as
with Soundbeam, this focus may also place high cognitive
demands on the user, serving as a dominant constraint that
distracts from the extended possibilities for stylistic and
technical variation. The eﬀects of this dominant constraint
might be lessened when recorded samples are used in such
a way that pitch-relationships are de-emphasized, but the
distribution of ﬁve samples across the cube would still de-
mand much from the user in terms of accurately triggering
desired sounds. If the tuning of the Skoog’s ﬁve notes in
a particular context such that a user cannot play a ‘wrong
note’, the Skoog would also place stylistic constraints on
the user, albeit in a milder form than identiﬁed with the
Soundbeam system.
The multiple means through which each button can be ac-
tivated does allow it to be activated through a wide range
playing techniques, as any force applied by a person or
an object will trigger some kind of sound from the instru-
ment. The Skoog is easiest to use and understand when
placed/braced on its bottom base, and when the instrument
is oriented consistently with respect to the user on repeated
sessions. In situations where the instrument is in motion,
or is not rested or braced consistently, it would be harder
for the user to remember, recognize or diﬀerentiate between
the sounds assigned ﬁve faces. As ﬁve out of six faces on
the interface are active, there is a high likelihood that when
trying to press a particular face, a user might inadvertently
trigger another when trying to grip the instrument. The
Skoog, then, works best when rested or braced, and oriented
consistently; it becomes awkward when held or moved. We
see this as a physical constraint, that encourages a prede-
termined style of interaction with the instrument through a
particular form factor.
Sound Conﬁguration. In these use-case, users inter-
acted with the Skoog as a single sound-making device, rather
than as an array of 5 faces. In these contexts, each face can
still serve as an individual input, but their sensitivity is in-
creased to the point that all samples/notes are activated by
small perturbations of the interface. This type of usage is
best seen in Skoogmusic’s video, “A new musical instrument
for children with special needs” [19, 1:03], where the Skoog
is manipulated as a whole by tilting, rocking and striking.
The harp-like output of the interface in this example is
constrained, in that each gesture leads to broadly a similar
output. The Skoog’s responses in this conﬁguration might
be seen as complex sound-events [13, 26], that change sub-
tly with diﬀerences in the style of physical engagement with
it. With only one malleable class of sound, a wider range
of actions can be supported without the above issues of
holding the Skoog or needing to orient it a particular way.
The constraints in this case are similar to those present in
a 1-DoF instrument. As a result, this conﬁguration of the
Skoog places a much lower cognitive demand on the user,
and as the example shows, might result in more diverse
playing styles and exploratory musical approaches. How-
ever, the Skoog cannot produce its own sounds, and thus
less open to the discovery of hidden aﬀordances than the
1-DoF instruments used in constrained DMI research men-
tioned above. The creative appropriation of the Skoog in
this conﬁguration would, therefore, be most likely to emerge
in the playing and gesture strategies of users.
Single-Button Conﬁguration. This third conﬁgura-
tion utilizes only one face of the Skoog, controlling a single
note or sample. It is included due to the similarity of the
interface in this context to the DMI used in Gurevich et
al.’s research [8], and because this conﬁguration can beneﬁt
users who would respond better to a 1-DoF interface as seen
in the video: “Music lesson for special needs students using
Skoog” [19].
In this case, the issues highlighted above with regard to
the keyboard-conﬁguration of the Skoog do not apply. The
instrument can be rested or braced on its inactive sides,
leaving it open to a far greater range of possible stances,
grips and orientations. This might give users more freedom
to explore how they interact with the device. However,
one possible issue remains; that the inactive faces will still
aﬀord pushing, but yield no sounds, which may confuse or
frustrate the user.
Skwitch Skoog Music have recently introduced a second
accessible interface, the Skwitch [18]: a one-button version
of the Skoog. The Skwitch is designed to clip onto a mobile
device, and like the Skoog, uses a companion app to trans-
late users’ gestures into sound. The system allows a user
to trigger tones from pre-deﬁned melodic phrases which are
either loaded as presets or composed in the app. The soft-
ware also allows a user to conﬁgure how gestures manipulate
the pitches within a phrase: triggering notes in sequence
in a forwards or backwards direction, arpeggiating notes,
164
or selecting random pitches from within the phrase. The
button can also be divided into segments, increasing the
interface’s dimensionality. At the time of our review, all
21 videos featuring Skoog Music’s Skwitch demonstrated
its use as an interface for melodic manipulation, with a
heavier reliance on touch-screen controls. The limitation
of ﬁxed pitches within a conﬁgured melody would intro-
duce the same kinds of dominant and stylistic constraints
from the point of conﬁguration as were identiﬁed with the
Soundbeam system, as the output to a variety of physi-
cal getstures will be bounded to the same melodic content.
The dominance of melody might override opportunities for
exploration of diﬀerent gestures or performance strategies,
and pre-conﬁgured melodies will limit the scope of users’
musical play. As the Skwitch is designed to work only when
clipped on to a phone or tablet, it has less scope than Skoog
to accommodate diverse physical gestures and orientations.
This again is a physical constraint.
5. SONIC-PLAY INSTRUMENTS
The eﬀects of design constraints in prototype instruments
were apparent, although the explicit focus in Wright’s own
research, which explored the design of sonic-play instru-
ments with a small group of non-verbal young people on
the autistic spectrum. Two prototype DMIs were developed
over the process of this research. Both had a Skoog-inspired
cuboid form factor, embedded loudspeaker, and embedded
audio synthesis and LEDs using the BELA platform and
SuperCollider [27]. The prototypes diﬀered from one an-
other in other respects, designed to target separate issues
identiﬁed for the design of sonic-play instruments.
Figure 1: 1st Prototype Instrument
The ﬁrst prototype (shown in ﬁgure 1) was designed to
explore the ways congruent and semi-incongruent gesture-
to-sound mappings might aﬀect the use of the instrument
in open play sessions [26]. The sensor made for this ini-
tial prototype had six segments, which could be used to
provide some expressive control over sounds. LED lights
were placed at the center of these segments. The overall
appearance of the instrument, however, was intended to
convey the impression of a single-button interface, taking
inspiration from Zappi & McPherson’s constrained instru-
ments [28]. It was hoped that the visual impression of the
instrument would be simple enough to allow a diverse range
of performance-strategies, but also leave the possibility for
ﬁner grained exploration with the sensor’s segments. The
instrument had been designed with the expectation that
users would primarily interact by pressing the sensors soft
surface, as the demonstration video shows [27]. It was also
designed to function with or without visual feedback from
the LEDs, as it wasn’t known in advance how this would
aﬀect users’play.
As this ﬁrst prototype was similar to the single-button
conﬁguration of the Skoog, it proved suitable for exploratory
play. Each of the participants in the study found at least
Figure 2: Orientations of Wright’s sound-play pro-
totype and the Skoog in six observed playing tech-
niques
one unique way of playing the instrument. The diﬀerences
in design between this prototype and the Skoog, however,
reveal interesting tensions between the nature of each DMI’s
constraints. Of the many playing styles observed in the ses-
sions, six are shown in ﬁgure 2, illustrating how the pro-
totype was used in primary directions with respect to the
player. These techniques were often repeated by partici-
pants from week to week, occasionally leading to situations
where a player would fail to produce any sound, having at-
tempted to orient the instrument properly for the repeated
technique. It is true that with the constraint of one sensitive
face, the prototype makes the production of any sound less
accessible. The addition of additional active faces solves
this problem, but also causes other issues. To illustrate
this, 2 all the orientations in which each technique would
successfully trigger a sound with the Skoog in place of the
prototype. This higher success rate has a paradoxical con-
sequence: the user is less likely to ‘fail’to produce a sound;
and more likely to press diﬀerent surfaces, or multiple sur-
faces on repetitions of a technique. This reduces the op-
portunity for unique playing techniques to have meaning,
or to have discreet replicable results. The constraints in
the prototype’s form, when compared to the Skoog, might
oﬀer a user a greater chance to meaningfully appropriate
an instrument, and comprehend diﬀerences in performance
strategies (albeit at the expense of more consistent success).
This was at its most evident with one participant’s unique
play with both prototypes. He exploited the curvature of
the instruments curved sensor by placing it face down on
the ﬂoor and, after tipping it up, allowing it to rock back
and forth under its own weight. This activity resulted in
far more chaotic and dense sounds than any other playing
techniques and was a hallmark of his play during Wright’s
research [26]. In other words, this participant exploited a
hidden aﬀordance and appropriated the prototype into a
unique personal practice. This was only clear, and possible,
because the instrument’s blank faces allowed it to be ma-
nipulated by hand, without inadvertently triggering extra-
gestural sounds. With the Skoog in its place, this hidden
aﬀordance may not have been discovered alongside sounds
from four other faces. At the very least, it is doubtful this
activity would have been carried out with such purpose and
165
clarity.
Initially, the prototype was tested without the LED lights,
as it was not certain how beneﬁcial the visual feedback
would be in supporting exploratory sonic play. When the
lights were turned on in later sessions, they had the eﬀect of
limiting users’interactions to those orientations and tech-
niques where the lights were in direct view. It encouraged
a normative mode of interaction but restricted the range
of personal playing styles that had developed without this
visual feedback. This served as an inadvertent persuasive
constraint, dictating how participants held and used the in-
strument.
The second-iteration prototype expanded on this original
design, taking on board the responses of the user group. The
size was reduced, and the build quality improved with 3D
printed parts and a pliable silicone outer shell, and the in-
strument was given an open speaker grille on its bottom face
for better sound projection. More signiﬁcant changes were
also made. The new instrument provided indirect visual
feedback; LED lights were diﬀused through the translucent
materials. Most signiﬁcantly, a small collection of switches
were added which would allow users to curate the sounds
and responses of the instruments themselves, rather than
having these choices made for them. Each switch would ac-
tivate one sound-set, and multiple active sound-sets would
also aﬀect each other, creating subtle variations with each
combination [27]. It was hoped that these switches could
be simple enough to be comprehensible (perhaps given some
time), but again have the potential for more complex play
when used in combination.
Figure 3: 2nd Prototype system: reﬁned instru-
ment with wireless switches
The open speaker grille on the updated instrument had
provoked many exploratory responses. The default sound-
set of the instrument (ﬁltered white noise) was particularly
eﬀective in highlighting the movement of any reﬂective sur-
faces in motion relative to the speaker grille (although this
wasn’t an intentional design feature). Sure enough, the play
of most participants focused on this hidden aﬀordance at
some point: the instrument was moved over ﬂat surfaces;
hands, feet, arms and ears were moved over the instrument.
As with the previous prototype, the pseudo 1-DoF design of
the instrument may have provided a clarity against which
these eﬀects became more noticeable. Many of the actions
associated with the White Noise would have been occluded
by accidental triggers from extra active faces.
The use of 1-DoF wireless switches gave users choices
about the stylistic sound and behavior of the instrument,
rather than structural aspects of a pre-composed musical
environment. The provision of this choice once again pro-
vided the opportunity for users to fail, playing sounds that
they did not like. In some cases, participants liked some
but not all of the sound-modules that the switches could
provide. On the one hand, this might mean that the user
does not always get to hear sounds he or she likes, but this
is also one way in which aesthetic choices can be made, and
preferences acquired. In the four case studies conducted in
the latter stages of Wright’s research, each participant made
some progress in comprehending these kinds of choices for
themselves, even if the range of choice was very limited.
For two of these four participants, the switches also pro-
vided access to some sounds that were pleasing, and some
that were displeasing. It is probable that, given a longer
period of use, each of these four young people would have
been capable of curating at least some aspects of their play
with the second prototype. This was only possible because
the stylistic constraints of the pre-conﬁgured commercial in-
struments were lifted, in favour of a more demanding, but
artistically accessible design. These choices, however, gave
rise to a more turbulent journey through the user testing
sessions for these two young people, raising challenging eth-
ical dilemmas. While there were gratifying peaks in these
participants experiences with pleasing sounds, there were
also phases of visible frustration with undesirable ones, the
latter not being an intended or desirable outcome.
Finally, it could be argued that the limitation of the in-
strument’s output to six sound-sets (one default, ﬁve as-
signed to switches), is a form of stylistic constraint. But
there are two key diﬀerences in the pre-coding of this proto-
type. Firstly, these sound-sets are made more accessible to
young neurodiverse users; four out of the ﬁve participants
who spent time with the instrument showed an emerging
understanding of the switches’function after ﬁve weeks of
testing. Secondly, the sound-sets interfere with one-another
when combined. When the user’s gestures are also taken
to account, the sonic design of this system leaves room for
sounds that weren’t anticipated in its design, i.e sounds can
be more meaningfully related to playing choices and style.
6. DISCUSSION
Unsurprisingly, instruments with few Degrees of Freedom
aﬀord a wide range of physical gestures, as the linear beam
interface in the Soundbeam system demonstrates. While
not strictly a 1-DoF interface, the apparently single-input
of Wright’s prototypes yielded a similar breadth in stylistic
response. Some of these responses also replicated the idea
low-DoF can lead users to explore Hidden Constraints [28,
8], only with a small non-verbal group of autistic partici-
pants. Conversely, the physical and persuasive constraints
identiﬁed in the Skoog and the LED lights of Wright’s ﬁrst
prototype had the eﬀect of restricting the diversity, but im-
proving the aesthetic consistency of play.
Finally, our small scale review reveals two separate appo-
raches to the implementation of these concepts along with
dominant and stylistic constraints. One strategy strives for
maximum participation within deﬁned bounds, the other
grants greater individual choice with increased risk of frus-
tration. The latter must be handled carefully, but it is also
possible this choice can bring new opportunities that allow
expert and non-expert musicians to“examine [their] precon-
ceptions of failure and detritus more carefully”[4], and make
the development of aesthetic preferences more accessible.
We propose that this is an area that could provide fruit-
ful grounds for further study. Previous research with con-
strained DMIs [8, 28] could be replicated with neurodi-
verse user-groups. Equally, designer/performer individuals
or teams might also tackle the question in another way, by
designing sets of instruments with varying degrees or types
of constraint, and putting them to the test in child-led en-
sembles modelled after the Artism Ensemble [2, 1]. With
further study, we hope that more detailed insight may be
166
revealed on the nature and inclusivity of constraints.
7. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We would like to thank the participating school and its
staﬀ for their assistance in facilitating the research that
contributed to this paper. It is especially important that
we acknowledge the seven children and young people at the

developing the prototype instruments presented as part of
this paper.
