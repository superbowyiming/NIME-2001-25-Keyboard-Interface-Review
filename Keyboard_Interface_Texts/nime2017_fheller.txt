ABSTRACT
Learning to play the transverse ﬂute is not an easy task, at
least not for everyone. Since the ﬂute does not have a reed to
resonate, the player must provide a steady, focused stream
of air that will cause the ﬂute to resonate and thereby pro-
duce sound. In order to achieve this, the player has to be
aware of the embouchure position to generate an adequate
air jet. For a beginner, this can be a diﬃcult task due to
the lack of visual cues or indicators of the air jet and lip
position. This paper attempts to address this problem by
presenting an augmented ﬂute that makes the parameters
of the embouchure visible and measurable. The augmented
ﬂute shows information about the area covered by the lower
lip, estimates the lip hole shape based on noise analysis, and
shows the air jet direction. Additionally, the augmented
ﬂute provides directional and continuous feedback in real
time, based on data acquired from experienced ﬂutists. In a
small experiment with ﬁve novices, most participants could
produce a sound with only minimal instructions.

1. INTRODUCTION
Learning to play an instrument is typically diﬃcult, but
while for some, producing the sound is as easy as hitting a
key and, therefore, the student can quickly focus on play-
ing songs, other instruments require decent eﬀort to even
produce the sound. The transverse ﬂute requires a steady
focused stream of air to produce sound, and “is the easiest
instrument to play badly” [4]. The simplest sound of the
ﬂute is already inﬂuenced by a series of parameters: the
angles at which the ﬂute is held, the angle at which the air
is blown into and over the embouchure, the width of the
air jet, and the air jet speed. Some of these factors can be
self-observed while playing in front of a mirror, but mostly,
corrections require an experienced teacher. As a teacher is

not always present during practice, this can easily lead to
frustration. In this paper, we present an augmented ﬂute
headjoint (Figure 1) that, using various sensors, localizes
the problem in generating the proper sound and gives feed-
back on how to solve the issue. The goal is to support
novice users during unsupervised practice by helping them
to produce a sound. We iteratively designed our augmented
ﬂute following recommendations from experienced ﬂutists
and successfully tested it with novices which were able to
produce a sound after a short time.
2. MOTIV ATION & RELATED WORK
The transverse ﬂute is composed of three parts: headjoint,
body, and footjoint. The headjoint contains the lip plate
where the embouchure is placed (Figure 2). The body as
well as the footjoint contain the mechanism to cover the key
holes to produce a particular tone.
To achieve a proper embouchure, the player has to relax
the muscles of the mouth, and then drag the lips towards
the corners of the mouth. The lip hole is then created by
letting the air go through the lips. The shape of the lip
hole has to have a longitudinal form; a round shape should
be avoided [2]. While the exact placement of the lips on
the lip plate is subject to the player’s anatomy, as general
guideline “the mouthpiece must be placed against the edge
of the lower lip where the red part of the latter begins” [1].
Fletcher analyzed the diﬀerent technical parameters of the
embouchure and their inﬂuence on sound [6]. According
to his measurements, the air jet angle is within a range of
25◦-40◦ down from the horizontal [5]. These guidelines were
34
used as references during the development of our prototype.
Most of the research on augmented ﬂutes was aimed at
increasing its expressivity by adding sensors whose readings
are used as input to additional eﬀects. Ystad and Voinier
proposed a virtually real ﬂute [13], an augmented ﬂute that
synthesizes the physical aspects and produces the sound
of an acoustic ﬂute. They used sensors to feed a synthesis
model. The cork of the headjoint was replaced with a micro-
phone to measure the air pressure inside the ﬂute. Magnetic
sensors were added to the keypads of the ﬂute to detect the
ﬁnger position. Additional ﬁlters simulating the wave prop-
agation could be applied to add eﬀects to the output sound.
The Hyper-Flute [7, 8] added sensors to the ﬂute without
compromising the original acoustic of the instrument and
technique. Thus, the placements of the sensors were strate-
gically located, e.g., pressure sensors were located on points
where the ﬂute was being held. The goal was to gather
data (from the sensors) in real time and map them to con-
trol digital sound parameters. Another augmented ﬂute was
proposed by Da Silva et al. [3]. They measured the airﬂow
velocity at two points (left and right) on the mouthpiece us-
ing two stagnation tubes from a pitot tube. The aim of this
study was to be able to control a ﬂanger eﬀect by sweeping
the frequency up and down.
There are some related projects that use augmentation
to assist learning especially for the transverse ﬂute. Siwiak
et al. [11] noticed the limited use of technology for ﬂute
pedagogy and as feedback tool for musicians. One of the
few projects is the tool proposed by Romero et al. [10]. Al-
though it is built around a recorder, the use of technology
to assist learning is important to mention. The sensor data
collected on the recorder was sent to an application that
provided feedback accordingly to assist the student. The
feedback addressed air pressure and ﬁngering. The applica-
tion also combined theory and practice.
A tool like the Blocki Pneumo Pro1 is a simple helper that
allows self-controlled learning, however, it does not produce
any sound, which forces the student to switch between the
two headjoints.

3. THE AUGMENTED FLUTE
To ﬁgure out what typical beginners’ mistakes are when
they learn to play the ﬂute, we analyzed six tutorial videos
available on YouTube. We observed what kind of errors
the students make, and how the teachers correct these: a
wrong placement of the lower lip on the headjoint, a wrong
angle of the air jet, an insuﬃcient amount of air, matching
the lip hole with the embouchure hole, and the shape of
the lip hole. In most of the cases, the teacher intervened
by manually adjusting the posture which is, obviously, only
1http://www.blockiflute.com
possible if the teacher is physically present, and thus not an
option if the student is practicing at home. We equipped
our ﬂute headjoint with sensors to detect these errors and
provide step-by-step instructions through software.
3.1 Lip Placement
To sense the placement of the lower lip on the lip plate, we
added three copper stripes as depicted in Figure 3. The
stripes are connected to the microcontroller and used as
capacitive sensors. They are isolated from the headjoint by
a thin sheet of paper and covered with a layer of paint, to
avoid direct body contact.

body contact.
3.2 Air Jet Angle
To measure the air jet angle, we use two ﬂow sensors for dif-
ferential measurement. One sensor is placed inside the bore
to measure the amount of air that is blown into the head-
joint, while the other sensor is placed on a beam attached
to the headjoint (Figure 1). To determine the position of
the external ﬂow sensor, we used stripes of thin plastic foil
to locate the angle of maximal diﬀerential pressure. Play-
ing the ﬂute was not aﬀected by the inner sensor, and only
minimal changes in sound could be detected. However, the
sound quality can be neglected as our ﬂute is designed for
absolute beginners.
3.3 Lip Hole Shape
The lip hole shape determines the width of the air jet. If
it is too wide, the air will hit the sides of the embouchure
hole and produce a windy sound [9]. Wilcocks indicated
that a wide aperture of the lip hole causes an unfocused air
jet [12]. Therefore, the amount of windy noise in a tone
is highly related to the lip hole shape. We decided to ac-
quire the lip hole shape indirectly by measuring the amount
of noise in the resulting sound. The use of cameras could
be an alternative, however, this requires additional integra-
tion of a camera into the headjoint and challenging image
processing.
As the tone produced by a ﬂute can been considered pure
due to the short harmonic development [5], we used a simple
subtractive approach to measure the amount of noise, and
thereby, the width of the lip hole. We determined the funda-
mental frequency of the tone, and fed it into thePitchEnv∼2
patch in PureData to eliminate the harmonic development
from the original signal in the frequency domain. The am-
plitude of the residual signal was then used as a metric for
the lip hole shape.

Figure 4: The user interface of our application. Pa-
rameters that are not within the speciﬁed thresh-
olds are marked red (e.g., lip placement), and green
otherwise.
Our software interface basically consists of step-by-step in-
structions to play the ﬂute’s headjoint own tone. We do
not consider the remaining body of the ﬂute, as the eﬀects
of closing holes to play diﬀerent tones can be practiced on
your own. At ﬁrst launch, the user is guided through the
diﬀerent steps of placing her lips on the lip plate, blowing air
in the correct direction and with the correct jet width, and
ﬁnally, ﬁne tuning the frequency by turning the headjoint.
Successfully achieving one of the steps unlocks the following
one. All elements are live visualizations of the sensor data,
which means that if one of the parameters drifts out of the
speciﬁed thresholds it is colored red (Figure 4). Once it is
back within the optimal range, it turns green again.

5. IMPLEMENTATION
All sensors were connected to an Arduino Micro 3 board
which communicated the data to a host computer for fur-
ther processing (Figure 5). For the diﬀerential air ﬂow mea-
surement, we used two IST FS1 gas ﬂow sensors, and the
capacitive measurements were performed using Paul Bad-
ger’s Capacitive Sensing Library. Audio was recorded using
3http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMicro
a small diaphragm condenser microphone connected to an
M-Audio FireWire Solo audio interface. The audio pro-
cessing for the lip hole shape detection was implemented
in PureData using the pitchEnv∼ and sigmund∼ patches.
The microphone was at 1 meter distance from the partici-
pant. Finally, the user interface and data analysis was im-
plemented using Processing. To determine whether the air
jet angle and the lip hole shape are correct, we used de-
cision trees that check the diﬀerent parameters against a
number of thresholds. For the lip coverage, we used sim-
ple minimum-maximum thresholds. The threshold values
for all parameters are based on an evaluation with expert
ﬂutists, which we will describe in the next section. All ses-
sions were performed in a regular oﬃce room (around 46dB)
and after oﬃce hours to decrease environmental noise.
6. EV ALUATION
We iterated over the prototype several times based on the
results of smaller evaluations.
Expert Panel: After having tested and calibrated the
system based on our own expertise, we presented the system
to four experienced ﬂutists who had 12 to 20 years of ex-
perience playing the instrument. The main purpose of this
evaluation was to calibrate the sensor thresholds to work
with a multitude of players and to determine the optimal
sensor values. After the calibration phase, we asked the
experts for comments and feedback. Three mentioned that
they could notice the capacitive sensors and that they had
to get used to the new headjoint, but switching to a diﬀer-
ent ﬂute requires the player to adapt anyways, thus it can
be considered a minor issue. One mentioned that he thinks
the sound quality was aﬀected by the additional sensors, but
was not entirely certain about it. Once the prototype turns
into a real product, the sensors can probably be integrated
in a way that sound quality remains good. We asked the
panel to answer some questions on a ﬁve point Likert scale
with 1 being the best. Half of the participants believed that
this application could be useful for beginners, with the oth-
ers being undecided (Mdn = 2.5, SD=0.96). All could easily
determine which of the parameters they had to change in
order to get a proper sound (Mdn = 2, SD = 0). The ex-
perts did mostly not feel supported by the augmented ﬂute
(Mdn=3.5, SD=1.71), but they could easily ﬁnd out how to
achieve a better result (Mdn=2, SD = 1.26). The low rating
for the question about the perceived support was probably
due to the fact that the thresholds were not yet optimal
for some of the players and therefore, the software gave in-
appropriate recommendations. However, this was solved in
the following iteration, based on the values we recorded with
the expert panel.
After integrating the feedback of the expert panel, we ran
a small pilot study with four novice users who had never
played the ﬂute before. This revealed a lack of guidance
and explanations in the interface that remained unnoticed
during the tests with the ﬂutists, mostly because they al-
ready knew how to solve the issue at hand. These problems
were ﬁxed before the ﬁnal evaluation with novice users.
Novice Users: We recruited 5 novices, 2 male, 3 female
to perform the test. None reported to have played the ﬂute
before but other musical instruments: recorder, piano and
guitar. All participants received a brief introduction on
how to produce a sound on the headjoint, and three of the
participants were asked to try making a sound on a regular
headjoint with no sensors. We did this to estimate whether
a simple explanation is suﬃcient to generate a proper sound,
but none of the three users was successful. All participants
then followed the instructions of our augmented ﬂute system
36
and only one was not able to produce a sound at all, which
was caused by an error that the system could not sense
(lips rolled over the teeth). Participants could easily detect
which parameter to change to get a better result (Mdn =
1, SD = 0.4), felt supported by the augmented ﬂute (Mdn
= 2, SD=0.5), and could easily ﬁnd out how to get a better
result (Mdn = 1, SD = 0.5)
Expert Review: To see whether our software gives proper
recommendations, we sent the ﬁve video recordings of the
novice users’ sessions to an experienced ﬂutist and ﬂute
teacher, with 18 years of practice playing the instrument
and 5 years of experience as an instructor. Overall, our soft-
ware only achieved partial agreement with the corrections
our expert would have given. The diﬀerences in recommen-
dations happened because the errors the participants made
could simply not be sensed by the ambient ﬂute (e.g., lips
rolled over the teeth, high tension in the lips), neverthe-
less, the eﬀects of these errors could be sensed. Factors like
lip tension cannot be measured with our non-intrusive ap-
proach. As we do not see our tool as a replacement for the
ﬂute teacher, but as an additional help for the students, we
believe that things like lip tension, rolling the lips over the
teeth, etc. would be covered during the ﬁrst lesson.
7. SUMMARY & FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we presented an augmented transverse ﬂute
headjoint that supports novice users during unsupervised
practice by indicating which of the many parameters that
inﬂuence the generation of sound is out of range and how to
correct the error in order to produce a proper sound. Based
on literature, we determined the four most important steps
to play a sound on the ﬂute and provide sensing mechanisms
to control these. We calibrated our sensors and thresholds
by recording the readings of four experienced ﬂutists. In
an experiment with ﬁve novice users, a brief introduction
and the augmented ﬂute were suﬃcient for most of them to
produce a sound. The intended user-case of our system is
the unsupervised practice time after the ﬁrst lessons, when
a teacher is not available and self-observation is not helpful
due to the large number of factors inﬂuencing the result,
which are partially not directly visible. The goal is to min-
imize frustration while practicing between the ﬁrst lessons.
In future iterations, the sensors should be tightly inte-
grated into a beginner’s ﬂute. Models made from ABS such
as Yamaha’s YRF-21 do not require the insulation layer for
the capacitive sensing, and the copper stripes could become
an integral part of the mouthpiece, eliminating their eﬀect
on the player’s comfort. Furthermore, the integration of
the sensors also reduces the impact on sound. Adding an
inertial measurement unit (IMU) to the set of sensors would
allow to correct errors in posture and handling of the entire
ﬂute.
