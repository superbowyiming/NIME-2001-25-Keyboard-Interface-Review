ABSTRACT
People have always used new technology to experiment
with new forms of music creation. However, the latest devel-
opments in artificial intelligence (AI) suggest that machines
are on the verge of becoming more than mere tools—they
can also be co-creators. In this article, we follow four mu-
sicians in the project Co-Creative Spaces through a six-
month-long collaborative process, where they created mu-
sic by improvising with each other and with computer-based
imitations of themselves. These musical agents were trained
through machine learning to generate output in the style of
the musicians. What happens to musical co-creation when
AI is included in the creative cycle? The musicians are from
Norway and Kenya—two countries with fundamentally dif-
ferent musical traditions. How is the collaboration affected
by cultural biases inherent in the technology, and in the
musicians themselves?
These questions were examined through focus groups as
part of two five-day workshops. Analysis shows how the
musicians moved between an understanding of machine as
tool and machine as co-creator , and between the idea of
music as object and music as process. These different inter-
pretative repertoires were used interchangeably and paint a
complex picture of what it is like being in the intersection
between different musical and cultural paradigms.

1. INTRODUCTION
Recent developments leave no doubt that artificial intel-
ligence (AI) will revolutionize how music is made. As ever
more impressive AI technologies are introduced, most of
the attention is dedicated to the generative capabilities of
the models and how authentically they can replicate vari-
ous genres of music. However, there is relatively little re-
search on how the creative process itself may be affected

by shifting the perspective and letting the machine act as
a musical co-creative partner. What happens to musical
co-creation when AI is included in the creative cycle? Co-
Creative Spaces is a research project that has taken this
question as a vantage point, and followed four musicians
through a six-month musical collaboration that resulted in
two concert performances. The musicians created new mu-
sic through interaction with each other and with virtual
collaborators based on AI. We refer to these virtual col-
laborators as musical agents, defined as algorithmic entities
that fully or partially perform creative music tasks [29]. The
musical agents in Co-Creative Spaces were created by using
machine learning (ML) on previous recordings of the musi-
cians improvising with each other, and could thus imitate
the style of the musicians in the group.
In addition to focusing on technology’s role in the cre-
ative process, Co-Creative Spaces also had an intercultural
dimension involving musicians from countries with different
music traditions (Norway and Kenya). Therefore, we direct
a critical lens at cultural biases manifest both in the tech-
nology and among the musicians themselves. This is a per-
spective that has become increasingly important in forums
within music and technology—fields that are still dominated
by men from Western countries [5]. The composition of par-
ticipants in Co-Creative Spaces gave us the opportunity to
adopt an intersectional perspective [13], where gender and
cultural variations can be problematized.
The research presented in this article is part of a project
initiated and funded by Arts Council Norway, and will be
featured in a chapter of a forthcoming book with the work-
ing title Creative practices in music . Our contribution fo-
cuses on two five-day workshops, where the musicians co-
created music with the musical agents. During the work-
shops, we conducted a focus group interview each day. The
transcriptions of these constituted the empirical material of
the project. Through an analysis of the musicians’ interpre-
tive repertoires, this article shows how the musicians oscil-
late between traditional and new understandings of music,
creativity, and culture under the influence of technology’s
dual role as a tool and co-creator. The use of interpretive
repertoires as a basis for analysis is grounded in the soci-
ological method of discourse analysis and provides insight
into how language constructs the reality of those who per-
form language acts [24].
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Co-creative musical agents
Although machine-generated music has a long history that
stretches back several centuries to experiments with me-
chanical musical automata [19], musical co-creativity is a
more recent phenomenon. Here, we define co-creativity as
a phenomenon that occurs in collaborative contexts where
both humans and machines contribute to a process or prod-
uct that is considered creative [18]. Early examples of co-
creative interactive musical agents include CEMS [11] and
The League of Automatic Composers starting up in the
1970s [7]. Since then, the number of musical agents has
proliferated. Many of these are identified and categorized
by Tatar and Pasquier [29], including several pioneering
systems [25, 21, 23, 2]. Of particular relevance for Co-
Creative Spaces is trombonist George Lewis’ improvisation
system Voyager, which he developed towards the end of the
1980s [21]. Voyager was imagined as Lewis’ autonomous
co-performer and is still in use more than 30 years later.
Central to Lewis’ music philosophy is the concept of mul-
tidominance, which he sets up as an opposition to the West-
ern aesthetic that often involves letting a dramatic fore-
ground dominate over background elements. In much African
music, however, there are many discursive layers in the mu-
sic: multi-rhythms and parallel melodies that do not harmo-
nize according to the principles of Western art music. Lewis
believes that Eurocentric music education does not equip its
students with the ability to perceive multidominant rhyth-
mic and melodic elements as anything other than noise or
chaos. Multidominance requires an inclusive attitude to-
wards the voices that contribute to the collective, where
the music emerges from the interaction. We believe that
it is Lewis’ focus on the musical interaction between hu-
man and machine and its social and cultural ramifications,
rather than the technology itself, that explains the Voyager
project’s enduring relevance. Such a focus is also what we
wanted to cultivate in Co-Creative Spaces.
2.2 Creativity as a social phenomenon
Creativity is often thought of as an individual charac-
teristic. A view of the “giftedness” of creativity emerged
around the time of the Enlightenment [1], with being born
as a “creative genius” as the pinnacle of creative endow-
ment. In recent decades, however, the focus on creativity
as an individual capacity has been challenged by theorists
who argue that creativity is a phenomenon that arises in
the interaction between multiple agents as well as in rela-
tion to the broader sociocultural environment in which the
agents operate [14, 33]. The difference between the individ-
ual and sociocultural conceptions of creativity is illustrated
in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Creativity as individual (1) and sociocultural (2).
The type of creativity that arises in groups of people can-
not be understood by studying the psychology of individual
members of the group—it arises as a result of group dy-
namics. Sawyer [26] refers to this as an emergent novelty.
Bown [6] emphasizes that such collective dynamics are in-
herent in artistic behavior. Ideas can arise, “not because
individuals think of them, but through a jumble of social
interaction. Such a view of creativity involves the possibil-
ity of being creative with nonhuman actors, such as com-
puters. In a similar vein, Co-Creative Spaces is also based
on the idea that creativity is a phenomenon that arises in
relationships—not isolated within people, but between peo-
ple and their surroundings. “Creative spaces” emerge where
ideas appear as a result of interaction—between musician
and instrument; between hand, pencil, and paper; between
collaborating people—and machines. To create is to dis-
cover the potentials that these spaces afford and to refine
them.
3. THE PEOPLE AND THE SOFTWARE
Co-Creative Spaces has consisted of the musicians Morten
Qvenild (piano and electronics), Gyrid Kaldestad (vocals
and electronics), Bernt Isak Wærstad (electric guitar and
electronics), Labdi Ommes (vocals and orutu1), and project
leader Notto Thelle. Thelle, Qvenild, and Wærstad have ex-
perience from previous projects that experimented with var-
ious forms of musical co-creation between humans and ma-
chines [31, 17, 34]. The experiences, knowledge, and tools
from these projects were consolidated into a piece of new
software specifically developed for Co-Creative Spaces, car-
rying the name CCCP (Co-Creative Communication Plat-
form)2.
A comprehensive technical description of how this soft-
ware works is beyond the scope of this paper, but here we
provide a brief description. The musical agents were trained
on a number of recordings of the project’s four musicians
engaging in collective improvisation sessions. Before train-
ing, the audio was segmented into slices based on an onset
detection algorithm. Using a feature extraction technique,
these slices were subsequently labeled according to loudness,
rhythmic, spectral, melodic, and harmonic content. The
feature vectors were then categorized using aself-organizing
map (SOM)—a type of artificial neural network that utilizes
unsupervised learning to map high-dimensional feature vec-
tors onto a two-dimensional topological grid [20]. Thus,
similar-sounding audio slices could be grouped together at
the same coordinates in the SOM. Finally, the original audio
files were encoded as sequences of indices serving as pointers
to potential audio slices in the SOM.
In run-time, these SOM sequences may be recombined in
countless ways using various sequence modeling techniques,
resulting in output sometimes appearing to mimic the style
of the material in the corpus and other times serving up
near-matches to the audio in the input stream. The music
agents “listen” to the human musicians and respond with
the recombined material according to principles that vary
between pure imitation, contrasting phrases, and an inde-
pendent and initiative-taking behavior that is more inde-
pendent of what the agent hears. These principles are based
on a number of studies of how musicians in different gen-
res improvise together by alternating between following and
leading in the interaction [31].
A more in-depth description of the algorithms that con-
stitute the main part of these musical agents can be read
in other publications [28, 32, 31]. CCCP should be con-
sidered a further development of the softwares described
in these publications, including both refinement of existing
modules and the addition of new functionality. A screenshot
of CCCP in its current iteration can be seen in Figure 2.
It is important to note that neither the technology nor
the humans involved are neutral, and that the answer to our
research question largely depends on how the technology is
designed and who uses it. Attitudes and ideas are encoded
into the products and may manifest themselves anew when
used [8]. On the other hand, it is not a goal for the music
to be neutral. On the contrary—for many people, music

one string.

is deeply personal. Some of the biases encoded into the
software may be desirable, because personal expressions are
precisely where aesthetics are emergent. We have tried to
balance these two perspectives through dialogue and aware-
ness.
4. METHOD
The research study has had a relatively narrow focus, and
the data used in the analysis for this article was collected
from ten focus group discussions between the musicians and
the main author, who moderated the discussions. The fo-
cus group discussions lasted between 20 and 40 minutes and
were conducted daily during the two five-day workshops.
The first workshop, in December 2021, featured three mu-
sicians (Qvenild, Ommes and Wærstad)—Kaldestad joined
the project later. The second workshop was held in May
2022, with all four musicians present.
In the analysis of the transcriptions from the focus group
discussions, we focused on how the musicians adapted their
language when discussing the creative process upon the in-
troduction and gradual incorporation of the musical agents.
The discourse analysis approach that usesinterpretive reper-
toires as analytical components looks at the constructive
function of language in individuals [16, 24]. Whereas so-
cial psychology traditionally assumes that individuals have
one personality and one coherent worldview, interpretive
repertoires can be used to examine how people adapt their
language—consciously or not—depending on social context,
how they want to present themselves, and what they intend
to represent in different contexts. People create and recreate
themselves every time they express themselves in different
contexts.
In the analysis, Thelle has reviewed the transcriptions and
coded the data according to a number of potential interpre-
tive repertoires. Based on the research question concerning
what influence AI may have on the creative process, the
intersection of different ways of understanding technology’s
agency, creative agency, and musical interaction was par-
ticularly important in the analysis work. The interpretive
repertoires we were left with were those that Thelle consid-
ered to be most profoundly anchored in the participants’
own formulations. The analysis has been abductive [30], in-
sofar as Thelle initially sought interpretive repertoires based
on theoretical understandings, but also remained open to al-
lowing for surprising angles that could lead to new or sup-
plementary theory.
5. RESULTS
We have identified some interpretive repertoires in the
transcribed data material that demonstrate how musicians
balance between different and partly conflicting ways of in-
terpreting music-creating practice. We present the reper-
toires as dichotomies where the musicians are apparently
pulled between different interpretations of music, technol-
ogy and creativity. One dichotomy that we have broached
several times is the understanding of the machine as tool
versus the machine as co-creator. Additionally, we propose
that regarding music as object stands in a sort of opposition
to viewing music as process.
5.1 Machine as tool or machine as co-creator
Co-Creative Spaces obviously began with a clear agenda,
suggesting already in its title that the machine can be seen
as a co-creator. However, it is far from certain that an in-
tention of this being the case means that this is actually the
view that the musicians have at all times. The focus groups
revealed a complex relationship between the two different
interpretive repertoires that represent the musical agent as
either a tool or a co-creator. For example, after interacting
with Ommes on the first workshop day (December 2021),
Qvenild pointed out that the bar for interrupting her felt
a lot higher than if it were the machine—a sentiment that
testifies to a fundamental difference in attitude towards the
musical agent as opposed to people as co-creators. As the
musical agents were trained and included in the interactions
over the first few days, it was commented that they lacked
a “dramaturgical sense”. There were discussions about how
to get the music agents to “shut up” and not be so persistent
all the time. Concurrently, the musicians revealed that they
tried to understand how the musical agents responded by
“trying many different things” and provoking responses as
if they were lab rats. This is clearly not a vocabulary mu-
sicians would use to talk about other human co-musicians.
Arguably, this is language taken from the tool repertoire.
The dual premise of wanting the machine as a co-creator
while being able to make decisions about how a co-creator
should behave has a paradoxical crux that we will return to
in the discussion.
A significant change of attitude took place during the first
week of the workshop. Already on the second day, Qve-
nild commented that “maybe we also have to shut up more
and give space to [the musical agent]”. After an interac-
tion between Wærstad, Ommes and a musical agent based
on Ommes’ vocals on the third day, Wærstad pointed out
that he felt he had moved away from an analytical attitude
towards the musical agent. He was now more preoccupied
with finding a flow without trying to understand what the
machine was doing. He experienced this change of attitude
as a movement towards a more intuition-based type of inter-
action, which is an attitude he recognizes from interacting
with people. He illustrated this by saying that he doesn’t
“try to understand how Morten’s brain works” when they
play together. Ommes had a similar experience of a gradual
acceptance of the musical agent’s contribution, but said it
was like “talking to a child”, because she felt that much of
the burden of carrying the conversation fell on her.
There was a breakthrough of sorts on the fourth day
when Qvenild played an improvisation with a musical agent
trained on Wærstad’s material from the previous days3. Ev-
eryone agreed that it sounded like an interaction where the
musical influence was mutual. Qvenild commented that it
felt like a turning point for him, because he experienced
a balance between his own playing and what the musical
agent contributed. His tactic had been to play much less
himself, and to let the musical agent appear more in the
foreground. Wærstad described this as stepping back and
“giving small seeds to the machine”. Based on this success-
ful interaction, a consensus formed around the principles of
“not giving the machine too much” and “giving space to the
machine”. These principles shaped both the further soft-
ware development and how the improvisation sessions were
set up in the second workshop half a year later.
During the five-month period between the two workshops,
Thelle and Wærstad worked on implementing changes in the
software based on comments from the first workshop week.
The algorithms were fine-tuned to ensure smoother tran-
sitions and the possibility of longer sequences that could
be experienced as more lingering. The updated software
presented the musicians with an unexpected problem. The
improvements made it more difficult to hear the differences
between the musicians and the musical agents, especially in
sessions where everyone was playing at the same time. In
order to make the contrast clear, it was decided that the
collaboration could take place in different “constellations”.
A musical agent could play with one, two, or three mu-
sicians at a time, but when a musician’s “virtual double”
was introduced into the collaboration, this musician would
hold back or temporarily stop playing. Sequences of such
constellations were agreed upon in advance of each session,
making it more obvious “who” the machine was.
Qvenild wondered if the musical agents had become “too
polite”, and missed some aggression in the newer responses.
3https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjersaPuI6w
Based on this and similar comments, a new function was
added to make the musical agent capable of making dras-
tic and random changes from time to time. The musi-
cians experienced this additional feature as providing ex-
citement, which they appreciated. It is noteworthy that, in
the project’s final phase, there was talk of making the ma-
chine more aggressive and unpredictable, whereas this was
less desired in the initial phase. The desire to be provoked
and thrown off by the machine contrasts with how the mu-
sicians described trying to provoke responses from the mu-
sical agents at earlier stages. They went from wanting to
influence to wanting to be influenced. This change may in-
dicate that the musicians drew more from the machine as
co-creator repertoire than the machine as tool repertoire as
the project progressed.
5.2 Music as object or music as process
The second pair of interpretive repertoires that we have
chosen to focus on is the relationship between conceptualiz-
ing music as object and music as process. The idea of music
as object has become so common that it is easy to overlook
that this is not a commonplace idea in a historical context.
Our language is permeated by the music-as-object reper-
toire. We refer to music pieces, musical form, and musical
works as if they are concrete physical structures. Carpen-
ter [10] pointed out that this is an extraordinary view of
music that has emerged in Western culture in the last two
centuries. From a larger historical and cultural perspec-
tive, however, music is experienced as something one does
as part of activities, such as dance, rituals, child-rearing,
and self-expression. This is also something that Small [27]
advocates for when he claims that music should be referred
to as something one does—musicking—instead of something
that is.
The four musicians in Co-Creative Spaces all explore the
boundaries of their respective genres and are drawn between
different cultural ideals in different ways. The three Norwe-
gian musicians (Qvenild, Wærstad, and Kaldestad) are all
involved in free improvisation, which in many ways epito-
mizes a music-as-process ideal and opposes the idea of mu-
sic as object. At the same time, they are also rooted in
the music-as-object paradigm—they are registered as com-
posers and receive royalties for works that are published as
music products. For her part, Ommes’ practice is grounded
in traditional Luo music from Kenya, which she freely uses
and incorporates into her pop-oriented songwriting. This is
a device also recognizable in Norway with the populariza-
tion of folk music—a commodification of traditional func-
tional music that creates a distance between the music and
the activities that created it. The transcriptions of the fo-
cus groups are rich in examples of the tension between the
object and process repertoires. We especially look at how
the inclusion of musical agents affected this tension.
From the outset, there was an underlying artistic ambi-
tion in the Co-Creative Spaces project that it would result
in a musical work—an album release. As a result, the focus
group discussions were continually drawn between the idea
of creating music as improvised through interaction with the
musical agents (musical processes) and the idea that inter-
action with the musical agents would contribute to creating
musical form (musical objects). The concept of form was
used by the three Norwegian musicians considerably more
than Ommes. Qvenild apparently became aware of this,
and early on wondered if he was “stuck in my old self” as he
asked Ommes if she was accustomed to thinking about form
or dramaturgical elements such as crescendos in the music
of her culture. To this, she replied that Luo music often
has an activity purpose. There are musical styles associ-
ated with different rituals that must be performed in certain
ways, such as slow-paced wailing in funerals (sigweya), high
tempo and long-form narratives for dancing ( ohangla), or
loud and rhythmical for self-praise (pakruok). The common
denominator for these music styles is that the music is of-
ten circular and repetitive. Wærstad compared this to other
kinds of folk and indigenous music that also often relates to
rituals and daily tasks: “A lot of the times the beginning
and end aren’t so important. We’re very concerned about
how the song starts and how it ends”. Ommes claimed that
some of what has been exciting about the collaboration with
Wærstad is that she has been initiated in structural think-
ing: “It’s a very awesome thing to now think about a bridge
and chorus and pre-chorus and all these things. Our songs
before were really just like one way the whole length.”
Although it cost her a lot of energy to get used to both
the musical agents and improvisation in general, Ommes
claimed that a maturing took place. In the second work-
shop, during the final phase of the project, she was much
more comfortable with both. At the same time, the other
musicians noticed that her ability to adapt to them may
have come at the expense of the intercultural aspect of
the project—she took on the aesthetics of the others in
the group to a much greater extent than vice versa. Her
distinctive Kenyan vocal style was less present than the
other musicians had expected. Qvenild pointed out that
Ommes had been outnumbered both culturally and in terms
of genre, and wondered if this had created an asymmetry
where her own musical background had not come through
enough. Although she assured that she had not felt that
way, the musicians came to an agreement that both tech-
nological and methodological steps could be taken to better
accommodate the Kenyan influence in the group. For ex-
ample, the musical agents had a tendency to disfavor repe-
tition and rhythmical groove, which are already mentioned
as basic pillars in traditional Luo music and other dance-
oriented genres that are Ommes’ “home turf”. Therefore,
the decision-making parameters in the musical agents were
adjusted so that they could have more repetitive responses.
Although this only led to minor changes in the response, the
collective awareness of this cultural bias in the technology
helped the group develop methods to bypass these limita-
tions, such as allowing Ommes to take the lead more with
themes in her own style.
Towards the end of the project, the musicians moved away
from discussing how the musical agents should create mu-
sical form. This development corresponded with the pre-
viously mentioned emerging desire to give more space to
the machine. The focus shifted to curating “constellations
for interaction” between the musicians and musical agents.
For the concerts, the “score” was a detailed overview of dif-
ferent human-machine duets, trios and tutti interactions 4.
In other words, the plan was not exactly what should be
played, but what kind of interaction should happen and in
what order. Once the idea of constellations came in as a
guiding principle, the project was no longer about creating
“a piece” of music. Rather, it became focused on dividing
the improvisation sessions into different types of activities,
as shown in the setlist in Figure 3. The choice of musical
agents (named after the musicians they were based on) and
the constellations of co-creating actors became what deter-
mined the course of events. When the musicians started
talking about constellations instead of form, the discourse
edged towards the music-as-process interpretive repertoire.

6. DISCUSSION
The analysis of the interpretive repertoires used by the
musicians in the focus groups demonstrates that the inclu-
sion of AI in the co-creative process led to new insights.
Accepting the machine as a co-creator turned out to be a
lengthy process, even though this was a premise for the
project itself. The musical agents were initially referred
to in terms that revealed a machine-as-tool repertoire, but
through repeated interactions, attitudes changed. As a re-
sult of the change in attitudes, the interaction and the entire
co-creative process also changed. The attention to possible
cultural biases in the technology and among the musicians
raised awareness in the group that also had an influence on
the creative process.
As previously mentioned, there is something paradoxical
about the desire to design a co-creator. The ability to influ-
ence how a co-creator behaves and makes decisions makes
it very easy to disapprove of the contributions it makes. As
humans, we have the power to implement technological “so-
lutions” in the machine pertaining to what we immediately
perceive as “un-musical” contributions. Between people, it
is different. To the extent that one tries to “fix” one’s co-
players, it happens at a much more abstract level where
social codes and communication are essential in order not
to step on anyone’s toes. Eventually, the musicians’ con-
tributions must be accepted for what they are, or else the
group dynamics will break down. When both designing and
playing with musical agents, however, the process of finding
technological solutions to musical problems can continue to
the extent that genuine interaction never is established. If
one always has the attitude that one can change the ma-
chine, it will forever stay a tool and never become a co-
creator.
A main finding in the project is therefore that the musi-
cians underwent a shift in focus, and became conscious of
changing themselves more than the machine. As the project
progressed, there was considerably less talk about making
the machine “good enough” and having it conform and more
talk about “how it can change me”. The musicians’ gradual
acceptance of the aesthetics of the musical agents as genuine
artistic contributions made it possible to give more space
for the musical agents’ creative agency. This contributed
to an improvement in both the individual performative ex-
periences and the combined result of the interaction. This
attitude change shows that it is not given that the machine
can be experienced as a co-creator. It is only when human
musicians are open to attributing creative agency to the
musical agents that a dialogue can develop, and interesting
new trajectories can be discovered.
There was also an apparent change of attitude among the
musicians also with regard to the other pair of interpretive
repertoires—music as object versus music as process. In
particular, the Norwegian project participants used struc-
tural concepts such as“form”and“work”when talking about
the creative process, demonstrating a tendency towards a
view of music as object despite actively trying to acquire a
more process-oriented view in their improvisation practice.
Qvenild’s point that Ommes was in a cultural minority led
to a realization that a balance had to be imposed. This in-
sight coincided with the realization that the musical agents
did not necessarily have to “create musical form”. The mu-
sical agents were adjusted to be more repetitive, and the
musicians introduced rules in order for Ommes to estab-
lish her “cultural signature” by taking the lead more often.
The fact that the musical agents were initially more or less
agnostic to rhythm and groove is a good example of how
algorithms can reproduce cultural asymmetry, such as has
been documented in many technology fields [8, 22, 4, 12, 15,
3]. It is worth noting that the software developers Thelle
and Waerstad (who are also the authors of this paper) were
not particularly diverse, so the issue of cultural biases in
technology turned out to be timely.
The analysis of the interpretive repertoires music as ob-
ject and music as process indicates that the cultural biases
manifest in the musical agents reflect the biases inherent in
Thelle and Wærstad’s aesthetic preferences. In a broader
sense, it can be said that this represents the predominantly
Western view of music as a structural concept, with the con-
sequence that the musical agents were developed with the
idea of creating something rather than doing something.
Through the focus groups, the musicians gradually turned
from formal thinking to thinking in terms of types of ac-
tivity. In this regard, they drew more tactics from the
music-as-process interpretive repertoire towards the end of
the project. The music performed at the concerts was thus
not “objects”, but rather what Cage [9] describes as “occa-
sions for experience”.
7. CONCLUSION
The main finding of this study has been that machines
can be musical co-creators, but this requires that people
are prepared to adapt to the aesthetics of technology, and
not just try to create the technology in their own image. By
providing the insight that playing less and giving the musi-
cal agents more space, the musicians in Co-Creative Spaces
demonstrated that striking a balance between viewing the
machine as a tool and co-creator can take musical creation
in directions that are different from interactions between
people. When taking the agency of the machine seriously,
co-creative spaces between humans and machines open up,
and this can provide valuable new perspectives for musi-
cal co-creation in general. We posit that creativity arises
in the absence of full control. It emerges when one’s own
will is attuned to what the environment affords and leads
to surprises. Musical agents are not replications of people.
They are something different, which the musicians learned
to take seriously. They also manifest the attitudes of those
who develop them, and co-creation with agents proved to be
a constructive way to challenge oneself to accept alternative
perspectives.
Co-Creative Spaces is a clear example of how artificial
intelligent technologies and machine learning can lead to
new forms of creative practices in music. It also clearly
demonstrates that technology development is a part of the
creative process. Instead of fearing that machines will take
over music, it may be better to invite them to a co-creative
dance.
