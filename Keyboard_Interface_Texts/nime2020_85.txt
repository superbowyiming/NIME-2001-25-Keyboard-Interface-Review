ABSTRACT
Percussive ﬁngerstyle is a playing technique adopted by
many contemporary acoustic guitarists, and it has grown
substantially in popularity over the last decade. Its foun-
dations lie in the use of the guitar’s body for percussive
lines, and in the extended range given by the novel use of
altered tunings. There are very few formal accounts of per-
cussive ﬁngerstyle, therefore, we devised an interview study
to investigate its approach to composition, performance and
musical experimentation. Our aim was to gain insight into
the technique from a gesture-based point of view, observe
whether modern ﬁngerstyle shares similarities to the ap-
proaches in NIME practice and investigate possible avenues
for guitar augmentations inspired by the percussive tech-
nique. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis on the
transcribed interviews: our ﬁndings highlight the partici-
pants’ material-based approach to musical interaction and
we present a three-zone model of the most common percus-
sive gestures on the guitar’s body. Furthermore, we exam-
ine current trends in Digital Musical Instruments, especially
in guitar augmentation, and we discuss possible future di-
rections in augmented guitars in light of the interviewees’
perspectives.

1. INTRODUCTION
The steel-string acoustic guitar is one of the most widespread
types of guitar; its popularity is normally associated to
the accompanying style of the American/European singer-
songwriter. However, the same instrument has been at the
centre of a radical wave of innovation in the approach, the
repertoire and the technique involved: that of percussive
ﬁngerstyle (Figure 1). It is a set of techniques for the solo

guitar performer, aimed at playing layered arrangements
rich in rhythm patterns that are reminiscent of a full band.
This style was born between the 1980’s and the 1990’s
out of the pioneering work of artists such as the late Michael
Hedges; over the last decade, however, it has seen a remark-
able rise in popularity and it has evolved into a commu-
nity of players, mainly thanks to online media outlets. The
strong visual appeal of the percussive technique is surely
one of the driving factors of its success; also, the ingenu-
ity of the arrangements has a way of inspiring guitarists
and other musicians who may be inclined to experiment on
their instruments beyond traditional capabilities. In fact,
similar styles are already being explored on the ukulele1,
the harp 2 and the double bass 3.

This article is motivated by the desire to analyse the per-
cussive ﬁngerstyle phenomenon within the context of New
Interfaces of Musical Expression (NIME). This analysis can
bring lessons in the design of new musical interfaces, and
especially in augmented guitars; likewise, it could inspire a
reﬂection on the emergence of new techniques on existing
NIMEs, how they develop, and if there is a way to encourage
such a phenomenon in the design of new interfaces.
We present an interview study that we carried out with
percussive acoustic guitar players. Firstly, we looked into
how each musician interprets modern ﬁngerstyle: their ap-
proach to composition or arrangement, the way they per-
ceive the instrument and their artistic intent. We investi-

gated their use of available technologies in music productio n
and in sound ampliﬁcation. The participants were then in-
troduced to the concepts of instruments’ aﬀordances and
constraints through the practical example of a guitar with
the body covered in bubble wrap, followed by a descrip-
tion of instrument augmentation; ﬁnally, they took part in
a ideation session where they described their preferred in-
teractions with the instrument, suggested possible routes to
augment the guitar and commented on their expectations
from augmented instruments.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Notes on Percussive Fingerstyle
An academic description of modern ﬁngerstyle is still in
deﬁnition, and an attempt with any musicological rigour
is beyond the scope of this work. However, documentaries
[26], online resources4 and recent theses [5] paint the picture
of a style that aims to reproduce the rhythm, the presence
and the musical complexity of a full pop, funk or rock band.
The many historical roots of percussive guitar include the
Ghanan high-life style, Flamenco percussion, acoustic blues
guitar pioneered by Bukka White and Robert Johnson5, and
the British folk school of Davy Graham and Bert Jansch [5].
Michael Hedges is regarded as initiator of modern ﬁn-
gerstyle: the use of both hands for fretting, plucking and
hitting the instrument and the use of harmonics and timbral
control to achieve layers in the musical texture have all be-
come common traits of later artists. His use of altered tun-
ings has the dual purpose of making open, complex chord
voicings easier to play and extend the instrument’s range
towards the bass [24].
Percussive ﬁngerstyle’s current popularity owes much to
the work of Andy McKee 6, Antoine Dufour, and the label
CandyRat Records. Their blueprint helped shape the style
into a visually attractive package of virtuosity in the per-
formance, skilful composition and instrument experimenta-
tion.
2.2 Gestures, Guitars and Augmentation
The rich gesture vocabulary present in percussive ﬁnger-
style performances and the players’ drive for experimenta-
tion suggests a brief survey of current gesture-based aug-
mentation, especially on guitars.
Gesture-based augmented instruments intervene in the
gesture-to-sound mapping: they change the eﬀect of sound-
producing gestures [12, 17], give sound-facilitating or ancil-
lary gestures a meaning that produces or modiﬁes sound
[31], or introduce new sound-aﬀecting gestures into the ex-
pressive space of the instrument. Examples of augmented
guitars of this family is Reboursi` ere’s Multi-modal Gui-
tar [25] and L¨ahdeoja’s electric guitar with a classiﬁer for
percussive interaction [14]; however, sensors to detect the
player’s movement for MIDI or audio control are a widespread
paradigm in commercial augmentations [10, 30].
More fundamental re-designs of the augmented guitar are
based on the decoupling of the mapping between the gesture
and the sonic event [18]: historically, the MIDI capabilities
of hexaphonic pickups (e.g. Roland GK3) have made this
decoupling possible on the guitar. The decoupling might be
partial if the acoustic sound generation of the instrument is
kept [7] or active sound control intervenes on its acoustics
[2]. Otherwise, the guitar’s interface can be reproduced as
a gestural controller for a sound-synthesising module, as is

the case for the Jammy MIDI guitar [10] and the SynthAxe,
a MIDI instrument from the 1980’s [3]. The decoupling
allows the reassignment of the instrument’s aﬀordances and
constraints, in line with the possibilities oﬀered by other
Digital Musical Instruments (DMI) [16].
Instrument augmentation can also oﬀer new perspectives
in the relationship between the player and other players, the
audience, or the player themselves. GuiART explores the
control of many layers of the performance through looping
and sound modiﬁcation [17]. The Sensus Guitar [30] is a
commercial product that gives the player both a complex
sensing interface and possibilities in the realm of collabo-
rative music [28]; Turchet and Barthet’s Ubiquitous Gui-
tar explores the involvement of another person in guitar
playing via mobile interface control [29]. Augmented in-
struments can also support learning, enhance accessibility
or remove encumbrances during speciﬁc activities such as
playing along to a video [1].
3. STUDY METHODOLOGY
A semi-structured interview study was carried out with ﬁve
professional musicians who had published original percus-
sive ﬁngerstyle pieces. The composition of the participants,
four men and one woman, covers a wide age range (19-55)
and a varied musical background, from self-taught to vary-
ing degrees of classical or formal training. None of them
was familiar with NIME literature, and they had varying
knowledge of current commercial DMIs. The interviews
were arranged between December 2019 and January 2020
either at Queen Mary University’s Media and Arts Tech-
nology recording studio or remotely, via Skype.
The interview sessions were scheduled to run for about
one hour. Questions, performances and activities were ar-
ranged around the following main topics, in running order:
• Performance of an original piece : the participants
were asked to play a percussive piece of their own com-
position, up to about one minute, and to provide a
verbal description of the piece.
• Approach to performance and composition : the
questions included a subjective deﬁnition of percus-
sive ﬁngerstyle, the background of the musician, main
inspirations, their relationship with percussive ﬁnger-
style as a technique and as a community, comments on
their approach to songwriting and live performance.
• Current technologies : the artists were asked to
describe the equipment used for performances, they
commented on the role of audio eﬀects in their per-
formance, and gave their opinion on technology com-
monly used by solo musicians such as loopers and oc-
tave pedals; ﬁnally they were invited to discuss about
the perceived limitations of their current equipment,
and how they could be overcome in the future.
• Wrapped guitar performance : participants were
asked to perform the same piece they selected for the
start of the interview with a guitar whose body was
wrapped in bubble-wrap, leaving only the strings ex-
posed (Figure 2). They could then report on their
thought process, and highlight their diﬃculties.
This task has a double aim. Firstly, the user is made
aware of new constraints in their interface, and we can
observe the artist exploring other suitable aﬀordances.
Moreover, this practical example is useful in preparing
the participant for the following discussion around re-
designing constraints through augmentation.
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020
441
Participants calling in via Skype were oﬀered the pos-
sibility of using an unplugged electric guitar for the
task, as the solid body does not allow meaningful
sound-producing interaction.
• Gesture-based guitar augmentation : the inter-
viewees were handed a set of drawings of the guitar
from three perspectives, front, upper shoulder and
lower shoulder. This was the basis for a discussion
about the preferred location for their interactions with
the instrument’s body; this context was also used to
discuss the design of an ideal guitar from a purely
functional and non-technical standpoint. The partici-
pants were not asked to draw or produce a prototype,
but rather to discuss about features they would like to
see implemented and how the implementation of such
features would change their relationship with the in-
strument and aﬀect their creative output.
The recorded interviews have been transcribed, then we
conducted an inductive thematic analysis (outlined in Braun
and Clarke [4]). Transcriptions of the interviews were coded
and organised into themes, enabling us to examine any com-
mon narratives and highlight trends, diﬀerences or unicity
in each theme.

not allowed to touch the parts covered in bubble-
wrap whilst playing.
4. RESUL TS
We present in this section results from the thematic analysis
by reviewing each theme.
4.1 Subjective Deﬁnitions of Percussive Fin-
gerstyle
Percussive Fingerstyle was described in part as the product
of the desire to provide a complete solo performance, espe-
cially of a modern pop/rock song, by using all the sonic pos-
sibilities oﬀered by the acoustic guitar; continuous research
and innovation on the instrument has the aim of “elevating
what you can do with a box and six strings ” (P4):
P1: “It’s trying to sound like a full band on one acoustic
guitar, by playing bass, harmony and melody and also try-
ing to emulate a drum-kit. It’s the eﬀort to make the guitar
sound bigger than it normally is in pop music.”
The desire to perform a complete musical idea without
relying on the use of recording studio time, other musicians
or Digital Audio Workstations (P3, P5 ) also motivates per-
cussive ﬁngerstyle’s pursuit.
Some participants hinted at the removal of subjective,
cultural and stylistic constraints as a conscious goal, in an
ongoing exploration of all the possible aﬀordances of the
instrument:
P3:“It’s the power of curiosity, it’s taking a set of resources
and totally re-thinking their potential, utility and persp ective
on the musical instrument. ”
Michael Hedges, and in particular his album Aerial Bound-
aries, was cited as an inspirator of the movement, as well
as the inﬂuence of Mike Dawes and his work in percussive
guitar tuition. The transformation of the steel-string guitar
from “campﬁre instrument ” ( P2) to a unique tool with its
own repertoire was also a common theme:
P5:“Michael Hedges, Alex De Grassi, Pierre Bensusan and
the acoustic Pat Metheny all brought the steel string guitar
to the level of concert instrument. They were the ﬁrst ones
to write speciﬁcally on the acoustic guitar, and they gave it
its own stage and its own space.”
4.2 The Instrument, Composition and Perfor-
mance
Information about the artists’ compositional process was
collected from their description of theit original piece and
questions about their approach to songwriting. All partici-
pants pointed to a routine of continuous discovery of chord
voicings, patterns, drones and rhythms, which they grad-
ually elaborate upon and collate to form a musical piece.
This process is supported by their learning method: play-
ers reported to make the eﬀort to not learn an entire piece
of music, but rather extrapolate techniques and inventions
to be re-used and re-interpreted in a more personal context
(P3).
The interviews mention a feeling of “ not being always in
control” of the composition ( P2, P4). Sometimes, an ac-
tive role is attributed to the instrument or the music itself,
and the composers describe themselves more like enablers
or observers:
P4:“Good songs come quickly and naturally and I connect
with the song that is trying to come out. You don’t really
realise fully what’s happening.”
Particular relevance is given to the experimentation with
tunings, promoted as part of the compositional process: a
diﬀerent song often requires a diﬀerent tuning. One partic-
ipant reports:
P5:“I intentionally change tuning after composing a piece
so that I don’t end up writing the same piece twice! ”
4.3 T opology of Percussive Interaction
The interviewees were asked to comment on where and how
they interacted with their guitar: their explanations and
their drawings allowed to identify a set of commonloci of
interaction, a simpliﬁed map of percussive ﬁngerstyle tech-
nique. Figure 3 shows the three most common positions of
the hand in percussive hits. Resting around the soundhole
aﬀords a kick drum sound above the strings with the wrist,
a snare-like sound when the strings are hit with four ﬁngers,
and a more tonal tom-like hit when the upper shoulder is
hit with the thumb.
The formula of wrist as kick, ﬁngers/ﬁngernails as snare
and thumb as tom is repeated in two other hand positions:
moving from the soundhole to the upper right shoulder, the
wrist and the thumb can rest on the top whereas the ﬁngers
can hit the side of the guitar, giving a deeper, drum-like
snare sound (P1, P4). A third position around the lower
right shoulder achieves the same snare sound but gives the
bass drum more thickness and loudness (P4).
More details to the rhythm are added by using accents,
akin to a drummer’s hi-hat patterns or ghost notes. They
are tapped by the left hand on either of the upper two shoul-
ders, but more commonly they are single-ﬁnger taps on the
strings, a technique borrowed by slap bassists such as Victor
Wooten (P2). In fact, the percussive parts are organically
integrated into the playing rather than being a separate

hole. Zone 2: hand wrapping upper shoulder. Zone

interaction: the phrasing adds detail to the rhythm, and
conversely the rhythm pattern is moulded around the hand
position on the strings:
P3:“Most percussion happens as a byproduct for a gesture
I’m already doing to another eﬀect. The less eﬀort I need
to make, the better.”
4.4 Wrapped guitar performance
All participants used the provided wrapped guitar in Fig-
ure 2, exceptP2 who was interviewed via Skype and there-
fore used a Gibson ES339 electric guitar. The performances
showed that the disrupting eﬀect of the task was dependent
on how much the player’s technique relied on body sounds.
Players P2, P3 and P4 were able to play the full piece
with minimal changes. For those players, the interaction
pattern mainly rests around the soundhole and the loss of
percussive abilities on the body is limited to the wrist-kick
movement. In those arrangements, however, the percussive
element is often happening at the same time as string pluck-
ing: the wrist-kick always accompanies a bass note struck
with the thumb. Removing the percussion, the rhythm is
still implied in the string technique.
Other participants had arrangements that relied more
heavily on accessing Zones 2 and 3, as well as the reversed
left-hand position seen in Figure 1. They had to funda-
mentally re-think their arrangement, starting from the em-
bodied reference of its original sound. Some tried using
the neck but were frustrated by its lack of resonance; ulti-
mately they all resorted to muted string tap sounds to re-
produce rhythm. They described the experience as a “ﬁght
with muscle memory ” (P5): the ﬁght against the embodied
movements was complemented by a dissatisfaction with the
timbre of the alternative solutions (P1).
4.5 Discussing T echnology and Guitar Aug-
mentation
4.5.1 Approach to T echnology
In the descriptions of the artists’ use of current technol-
ogy, audio eﬀects were reportedly used as “polishing tools ”
(P2, P3) to enhance the guitar’s acoustic sound, rather
than modifying it for musical eﬀect. Careful positioning
of multiple acoustic transducers on the guitar is coupled
with signiﬁcant equalisation, to get both a natural string
sound and good response from the percussive hits (P1).
Reverb eﬀects are sometimes used to enhance the decay of
drony sounds in compositions, and were viewed as “creators
of space ” (P4). Loop stations are used to build upon ideas
during composition, but their use as a live performance tool
imposes constraints on the structure and on the delivery of
the song:
P3: “ The problem is that it feels like your song is taking
5 minutes to start: it feels quite predictable and slow as
a listener, unless the act of laying foundations for a track
becomes part of the entertainment.”
4.5.2 P articipants’ Suggestions
In the ideation session, the musicians were asked to dis-
cuss the features of an ideal guitar with which they would
overcome their perceived limitations, or ﬁnd new expres-
sive possibilities. A frequent remark was that some gestures
have a mismatch between the force needed to produce sound
and the loudness of the outcome: hammer-ons with the left
hand (P1) and drumming “rolls” on the soundboard ( P4)
require a lot of force, therefore they feel unnatural during
quiet parts of a composition, and have a reduced expressive
dynamic range.
Other examples hinted at the separation of the layers of
the composition, to give them a more distinct sound qual-
ity. The vocal quality of the melodies would be enhanced by
longer and possibly controllable note decay, as could long
drones (P1, P5); magnetic actuators (E-Bow) are already
used by some participants to that eﬀect. The selective appli-
cation of eﬀects and sound overlays (synth and piano sam-
ples) was proposed as a way to enrich particular techniques:
a practical example would be to enhance the sensation of
“space” through the use of reverb swells only on chords and
harmonics ( P4).
An outlier is P2’s suggestion of an intelligent instrument
with real-time computational creativity capabilities throug h
the creation of AI musicians. Playing with virtual musi-
cians was regarded as a desirable performance tool, on the
condition that the AI-driven part would also have a visual
element for the purpose of audience engagement.
4.5.3 High-level Design Suggestions
When confronted with the idea of having digital technology
on their own wooden instrument, most players conﬁrmed
that they would approach an augmented instrument with
the same drive for sonic exploration that informs their cur-
rent compositional approach:
P5:“[An augmented guitar] would make me think diﬀerent.
When I play I’m thinking, if I’m hearing sounds I would try
to follow them. I would move towards exploring the sound,
rather than the physical instrument.”
We were cautioned against drifting away too much from
a simple instrument: Pat Metheny’s Pikasso guitar, an in-
strument with 42 strings, was used byP5 as an example of
a device that appears to have endless possibilities but ends
up being used to always make the same sounds.
A perceived limit of digital interfaces seems to be the lack
of spontaneous, nuanced control:
P4:“Being at the mercy of computers is frustrating, because
it cuts the level of spontaneity and unpredictability in the
performance. The best performer is the one that gives you
a diﬀerent interpretation of the piece every time. I’m a bit
hesitant to mechanise those real-time human decisions.”
Finally, one participant demonstrated an awareness of
the meaning of their ancillary gestures, arguing that mu-
sic needs an element of “intangibility” :
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020
443
P4: “ The intangible is what makes music music: on the
one hand, you can say that physically [the gesture] produc-
ing nothing, but it’s a part of that person getting lost in the
piece, and what makes the audience completely captivated.”
4.6 Discussion
4.6.1 V irtuosity and Material-Based Interaction
All players described a compositional process that matches
the description ofmaterial-oriented musical interaction [20]:
the creative process is seen as a negotiation between the
player and the instrument, and its sonic outcome is not fully
anticipated. The top-down approach of conveying a musical
idea is complemented or even superseded by the bottom-up
inspiration that comes from the experience of the device’s
constraints [16].
A consequence is that the creative output is highly inﬂu-
enced by what De Souza called the instrument’s idiomaticity
[6, chapter 3]: the space in pitch, chord voicing and timbre
that the interface aﬀords most naturally. An exploration
based on the geometry of the guitar will favour positions
that are easier to reach, or require less eﬀort to play in
sequence.
De Souza also observed how the change of tunings, cen-
tral in modern ﬁngerstyle, was useful to jazz guitarist Kurt
Rosenwinkel: he reported to change the tunings across com-
positions, in an act of “voluntary self-sabotage” aimed at
breaking the embodied geometric idiomaticity of standard
E-A-D-G-B-E tuning [6, chapter 4].
4.6.2 P ercussive Fingerstyle NIME
There are important similarities and diﬀerences between
what we observed in percussive ﬁngerstyle and NIME prac-
tice, as described for example by Morrealeet al. [19]. Mod-
ern ﬁngerstyle researches the broadest possible palette of
sounds and wants to connect guitar playing to as many
music-making practices as possible, rather than perfecting
a single craft: the desire to connect diﬀerent practices is one
trait of NIME design. On the other hand, where NIME and
DMIs are normally designed to every speciﬁc need [16], per-
cussive ﬁngerstyle looks more like the attempt to enhance
the guitarist’s expressive capabilities to their physical limit,
without re-engineering the instrument.
It seems, however, that the approach behind percussive
ﬁngerstyle is not inentionally limited to acoustic tradition al
instruments. We observed how our artists seemed keen on
our hypothetical discussion about digital instrument aug-
mentation. The literature has accounts of unexpected ap-
propriation of highly constrained NIMEs [8, 33], albeit not
by NIME practicioners themselves. We infer that there
may be a practice within the NIME community analogous
to modern ﬁngerstyle guitar, whose purpose is to ﬁnd af-
fordances and develop virtuosic technique beyond the ba-
sic sound-producing capabilities expected from the instru-
ment. This subset of players, or the encouragement of such
practice, could arguably be named “percussive ﬁngerstyle
NIME” .
4.6.3 Interpreting Design F eedback
Our participants’ considerations on high-level design deci-
sions in augmented instruments are quite consistent with
current literature on control and appropriation.
Firstly, we showed that the players argued for a small
number of simpler aﬀordances in an augmented instrument.
Zappiet al. ’s study [33] also underlines how reducing the
degrees of freedom of a musical interface enhances the gran-
ularity in its appropriation.
However, fewer degrees of freedom do not imply a re-
duction of micro-diversity or of predictable control over the
instrument. Jord` a [13] deﬁnes micro-diversity as the abil-
ity of the instrument to enable expressive deviation [27], by
means of control over details such as diﬀerences in tempo,
timbre, intensity and voicing. Plus, the degree of HCI con-
trol that proﬁcient practice expects is the ability to predict
the instrument’s state at any given time [32], regardless
of how non-linear the control interface is [21]. The desire
for micro-diversity, expressed as spontaneity in the perfor-
mance, emerges from the players’ critique of loopers and
P4’s description of spontaneous control at p. 4.5.3.
Finally, we propose a design decision based on P4’s ac-
count of the need for an “intangible” gesture space in live
guitar performance. We intend to limit our augmentation to
those gestures that have an obvious sonic meaning, in other
words, any tactile interaction on the instrument. The soni-
ﬁcation of ancillary gestures of guitar players (investigated
e.g. in [15]) will be outside the scope of our work. The
challenge there is to complement the musician’s thought
process and the communication with the audience, and also
avoid HCI’s “Midas touch” [11], the eﬀect of a controller re-
sponding with sound to involuntary or purposeful non-sonic
gestures.
4.7 Future Research
We considered how to involve our participants’ suggestions
in future studies and prototypes.
The perceived lack of dynamic range in the percussion
suggests a number of solutions: examples are the reinforce-
ment of the percussive hits through active control, or even a
total de-coupling of percussive interaction through the vir-
tual physical model of a plate or a drum, similar to Pardue
et al.’s violin work [23]. We intend to evaluate these models
and use them as research probes: understand how diﬀerent
technologies are appropriated, and whether the relaxation
of physical limitations translates into more perceived aﬀor-
dances.
The players’ desire to separate diﬀerent techniques sug-
gests an investigation into real-time classiﬁcation of gui tar
gestures, including percussive interactions. Each separated
layer could be given a wider dynamic range, be processed
by diﬀerent eﬀects, or control a diﬀerent synthesised sound.
This task-based improvement may not give the instrument
any new aﬀordances [22]; however, classifying capabilities in
an augmented guitar open up to the new and growing ﬁeld
of AI in augmented instruments. Machine understanding
of the player’s gestures could be coupled with a degree of
computational creativity, following the example of simpler
NIMEs such as Hantrakul and Kondak’s gesture follower on
the ROLI Lightpad [9]. this more ambitious target could
help deﬁne the identity of Intelligent Instruments and the
future direction of augmented instruments.
5. CONCLUSIONS
The interview study has given us important initial insight
into the percussive ﬁngerstyle technique; we outlined the
most common types of interactions and a simpliﬁed map
of their locations. Our ﬁndings suggest that percussive ﬁn-
gerstyle players have developed a method of performance
and composition around the constraints of the musical in-
strument, that is reminiscent of NIME practice. This aﬃn-
ity seems to be preserved in their exploratory attitude to
digital instrument augmentation. Their expectations from
musical technology, on the other hand, are akin to those
of expert players using traditional techniques: they include
the search for micro-control and carefully contained unpre-
dictability. The role of ancillary gestures as an “intangible”
but irreplaceable element of musical performance was also
discussed in the context of gesture-based augmentation.

We suggest that percussive ﬁngerstyle could be gener-
alised as the search for all non-obvious aﬀordances and the
development of solo virtuoso practice on constrained musi-
cal interfaces: it could be extended to many other instru-
ments and even NIME. We also propose, as part of our
future research, a range of probes built around our partici-
pants’ suggestions to improve the dynamic range of percus-
sive hits and enhance micro-diversity in a DMI interface;
we will also look into the integration of classifying capabil-
ities and limited computational creativity in an augmented
guitar.
