ABSTRACT
This paper discusses a new approach to acoustic amplitude
modulation. Building on prior work with electromagnetic
augmentation of acoustic instruments, we begin with a the-
ory of operation model to describe the mechanical forces
necessary to produce acoustic amplitude modulation syn-
thesis. We then propose an implementation of our model as
an instrumental prototype. The results illustrate that our
acoustic amplitude modulation system produces control-
lable sideband components, and that synthesis generated
from our corresponding numerical dynamic system model
closely approximates the acoustic result of the physical sys-
tem.

1. INTRODUCTION
Recent expansion of electromagnetically (EM) augmented
instruments illustrates a growing interest in acoustic synthe-
sis. These approaches access new properties of an acoustic
instrument through EM excitation, and are capable of gen-
erating sonic results strongly resembling electronic sound
synthesis.
A particularly challenging aspect of augmented EM in-
strument design is the description and evaluation of under-
lying system dynamics. Many augmented acoustic instru-
ments demonstrate complex sonic behaviors without mod-
iﬁcations [6, 10]. Complexity arises from interactions be-
tween acoustic instruments and EM augmentations. Non-
linearities within these systems, including signal modula-
tion, are even more diﬃcult to account for and still more
challenging to control [19, 20].
Our investigation focuses on acoustic amplitude modula-
tion (AAM) of driven harmonic oscillators. The aim is to

use a dynamic model approach to AAM and present an EM
augmented harmonic oscillator capable of producing acous-
tic amplitude modulation.
2. PRIOR WORK
We adopt the deﬁnition of acoustic synthesis as a ”sound-
generating process in which synthesis is carried out in acous-
tical terms: frequency, spectrum, waveform, amplitude, mod-
ulation, and so on.” [5]. Early systems exhibiting acoustic
synthesis include the Helmholtz synthesizer [18], and later
the Rhodes Piano ”tone-bar” system [21]. Recent EM Aug-
mented instruments include actuation of strings [2, 3, 8,
14, 17], metal bars, asymmetric tuning forks [4, 24], and
non-pitched percussion [19, 20]. In these instruments, EM
actuation is presented as an alternative to conventional ac-
tuation, providing means to shape or sustain sound in new
ways [17].
2.1 Acoustic Signal Modulation
Two notable historical precedents exist in acoustic signal
modulation synthesis. Both systems were developed for
the electronic organ: the Hammond Tone Cabinet and the
Leslie speaker, shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Patent images for therotor tremulantused
in the Hammond Organ (left), and the ”mercury
slip-ring assembly” used in the Leslie Speaker Cab-
inet (right). [7, 12]

The Hammond design produces AAM synthesis, whereas
the Leslie design produces Acoustic Frequency Modulation
(AFM) synthesis by exploiting the Doppler eﬀect through
rotation of directional sound sources [9]. The Hammond
Organ Company implemented arotor tremulant invented by
B. Hartsough to produce a tremolo-like eﬀect using acoustic
amplitude modulation [7]. Hammond modiﬁed an existing
tone cabinet, the D-20, to include a rotor drum in the DXR-
20 and XR-20 tone cabinets [26]. The Hammond rotor drum
generates acoustic AM using a spinning drum with slotted
vents that ﬁlter sound generated from small speakers. The
Hammond and Leslie systems are limited by rotational rate
and sound propagation, thus limiting the frequency range
to exclusively narrow-band (tremolo-like) modulation.
We encountered similar limitations in earlier prototypes
utilizing a rotating aperture and tuning fork design, due to
the high RPM’s required to produce higher frequency side-
band components. In an eﬀort to overcome this problem, we
oﬀer a Time-Varying Damping (TVD) solution presented
ﬁrst as a theory-of-operation in Section 3 and then as an
instrumental prototype in Section 4.
3. AAM THEORY OF OPERATION
3.1 Signal Modulation
Signal modulation is the process of combining two signals
into a third signal containing desired properties of both sig-
nals, such as frequency sideband. In the time-domain this
corresponds to multiplication of carrier and modulator sig-
nals with the mathematical form,
A(t) = M(t) ×C(t) = M(t) ×C0 cos(ωct) (1)
where A(t) is the resultant signal, M(t) is the modulator
signal, and C(t) is the carrier signal with constant fre-
quency ωc. Equation 1 applies for all forms of Amplitude
Modulation (AM), including Acoustic Amplitude Modula-
tion (AAM). To illustrate sideband generation, we assume
constant frequency for a time-varying modulator envelope
function M(t) = cos(ωrt). Then A(t) is of the form:
A(t) = cos(ωrt) ×C0 cos(ωct+ δ)
= 1
2C0[cos((ωc + ωr)t+ δ) −cos((ωc −ωr)t−δ)]
(2)
with δ the phase angle. A(t) includes the desired sideband
components in the set ωAM = {ωc±ωr}in cos(ωc+ωr) and
cos(ωc −ωr) shown in equation 2. This amplitude modula-
tion through the nonliniearities of two or more frequencies
is known as intermodulation.
Harmonic sidebands of the form ωAM = {ωc ±n·ωr|n∈
N}occur when the carrier signal is overdriven. Intermod-
ulated sidebands occur as a linear combination of the car-
rier and the modulating signal, which produce a continuous
range of sidebands that can intersect harmonic sidebands.
Additionally, the frequency of the modulator need not be
constant and any M(t) can be used to modulate a carrier
using the Fourier Transform. AAM synthesis of sidebands
components arise by the same principle in a physical system.
3.2 Dynamic System Model
We describe AAM as a dynamic system under a Single De-
gree of Freedom (SDOF), illustrated in Figure 2. The sys-
tem consists of an acoustic carrier harmonic oscillator and
a modulator-actuated TVD mechanism, where mand kare
mass and spring constants, respectively. The oscillator is
driven by F(t). The system is described by the equations
of motion (EOM) in sections 3.3 and 3.3.2.
System inputs for the carrier and modulator signals are
deﬁned as two generic oscillators or unit generators, where
⨂
car corresponds to the carrier signal and ⨂
mod corre-
sponds to the modulator signal. These signals are then
transformed into electromagnetic force as described in [15].
3.3 SDOF Equations of Motion
If an object’s position is directly related to acoustic ampli-
tude, then we can model acoustic amplitude as a function
of position with a SDOF. This section develops the theory
of tracking the position of mass m.

3.3.1 Driven Harmonic Oscillator
When the object’s natural frequency is actuated, it is in
resonance. The natural frequency ωc of a harmonic oscil-
lator is dependent on mass m and spring constant k, given
by the relationship k= ω2m. Its position X(t) satisﬁes the
following diﬀerential equations:
mx′′(t) + ξx′(t) + kx(t) = F(t) (3)
x′′(t) + ξ
mx′(t) + ω2x(t) = F(t)
m (4)
where m is the mass of the object and ξ is the material’s
damping coeﬃcient. The carrier signal is generated by actu-
ating the system’s consistent natural frequency, using input
signal ωs. This produces the driving force denoted in Equa-
tion 5. Under EM actuation, an input’s signal frequency is
typically one half ( n= 2) or one fourth ( n= 4) the carrier
frequency [15].
F(t) = F0(cos(nωst) + 1) = F0(cos(ωct) + 1) (5)
When one strikes a tuning fork, its sound gradually de-
creases in volume. This corresponds to the transient dissi-
pation of energy after an initial force, described by x1 and
x2 in equation 6. The coeﬃcients of x1 and x2 are zero if
the mass is initially at rest. With constant and positive m,
ξ and k, with the mass initially at rest, the motion of mass
m is govern by the steady state solution in Equation 7:
X(t) = c1x1(t) + c2x2(t) + Acos(ωct) + Bsin(ωct) (6)
X(t) = Acos(ωct) + Bsin(ωct) = M0 cos(ωct+ δ) (7)
where Aand B depend on F0 and are then reformulated as
M0 and the phase angle δ.
9
When the driving frequency ω is equal to the carrier fre-
quency ωc, the coeﬃcient M0 is given as:
M0 = F0√
m2(ωc −ω)2 + ξ2ω2
= F0
ξωc
(8)
where ωc−ω= 0. This expression is only correct when m,ξ,
and k are constants, yet the inverse relation in equation 8
suggests amplitude M0 can be modulated by varying either
the driving frequency F(t) or damping value ξ.
3.3.2 Modulation via TVD
The driving frequency must be held constant to produce
a consistent carrier signal, thus we produce Acoustic Am-
plitude Modulation using Time-Varying Damping (TVD),
using a similar approach found in variable impedance actu-
ators and variable dampers utilized in anti-oscillatory sys-
tems such as robotics, active vehicle suspensions, and earth-
quake mitigation systems [27, 16, 11]. This is best achieved
if certain conditions are met:
1. The object is driven at its resonance frequency i.e.
m2(ω0 −ω)2 = 0
2. Change damping value ξ is small enough so that the
natural frequency is the same, yet big enough to change
the amplitude of ωc.
ξis now a function of time, whereX(t) satisﬁes the following
diﬀerential equation:
x′′(t) + ξ(t)
m x′(t) + ω2x(t) = F(t)
m (9)
The position of a mass under TVD can only be solved nu-
merically, but we can illustrate periodic damping modula-
tion based on the relationship in Equation 8. We chooseξ(t)
such that M(t) is unipolar and sinusoidal and then combine
it with Equation 7.
M(t) = F0
ξ(t)ωc
= F0
ξ0ωc
(cos(ωrt) + 1)
X(t) = M(t) cos(ωct+ δ)
= ( F0
ξ0ωc
+ 1) cos(ωrt) ×cos(ωct+ δ)
= C0[cos((ωc + ωr)t+ δ) −cos((ωc −ωr)t−δ)]
(10)
where C0 is the combined constant coeﬃcient. If the modu-
lating signal is periodic, the measured sidebands are ωAM =
ωc ±ωr. This formulation of intermodulation produces side-
bands consistent with Equation 2. We later solve for X(t)
numerically with ξ = cos( ωrt) and compare the synthesis
model to the acoustic synthesis of the AAM Prototype in
Section 5.2.
4. AAM PROTOTYPE
4.1 Design
Figure 3 illustrates the basic conﬁguration of the AAM pro-
totype design. This design contains all the functional ele-
ments of the dynamic system model presented in Section 3.2
consisting of the following active components:
1. Acoustic Carrier Harmonic OscillatorA driven
harmonic oscillator composed of an EM actuator and
a tuning fork.
2. Modulator-Actuated TVD: An actuated TVD mech-
anism, consisting of an EM actuator and an acoustic
damping surface or medium.
3. Stabilization Mechanism: spring-loaded stabiliza-
tion frame restores the tuning fork to the zero position.

components 1. Acoustic Carrier Harmonic Oscilla-
tor, 2. Modulator-Actuated TVD, 3. Stabilization
Mechanism
4.1.1 Acoustic Carrier Harmonic Oscillator
A harmonic oscillator consisting of a tuning fork produces
the acoustic carrier signal in the AAM prototype. The sym-
metric tine movement of the fork generates an eﬃcient, al-
most perfectly sinusoidal motion in the stem. Since, their
motions are coupled, modeling the position of the tines di-
rectly describes the motion of the stem and its acoustic
eﬀect [23]. A cylindrical EM actuator drives the tines of a
steel tuning fork at half or one-fourth its natural frequency,
since both positive and negative magnetic ﬂux attracts fer-
romagnetic objects [15]. This conﬁguration produces two
salient carrier signals, the natural frequency ωc1 and twice
its natural frequency ωc2.
4.1.2 Modulator-Actuated TVD
Displacement of the fork tines determines the amplitude of
the periodic output signal, thus modulating the displace-
ment of the forks through damping produces amplitude
modulation. The second EM actuator applies force to the
ﬁxed stem and causes it to pivot slightly. Since the angle
is small and contact area is small, TVD is linearlized and
modeled as horizontal displacement of the tines in Figure 3.
Contact between the tuning fork tine and damping mate-
rial on the carrier AM actuator produces the modulator-
actuated TVD eﬀect. This corresponds to a nonsinusoidal,
periodic modulation signal. Since the constant signadrivel
frequency from the carrier electromagnet continues to excite
the tines, the natural frequency of the tuning fork appears
to remain the same. This is likely because damping only
occurs to a limited cross section of the tine, while the rest
of the tuning fork is unaltered.
10
4.1.3 Stabilization Mechanism
A third component is a suspension system consisting of a
three-leg base with a hole for a tuning fork and two com-
pression springs. Two end-blocks control the tension of the
springs to accommodate diﬀerent diameter harmonic res-
onators. This construction provides restoring-force to re-
turn to the mass’s equilibrium position.
4.1.4 Isolation and Ampliﬁcation
Additional non-active components decouple the force gener-
ating noise from the desired AAM signals and acoustically
amplify the signals. Using a T-Frame design we separate the
structure holding the electromagnets from the tuning fork
and stabilization mechanism. This decreases signal bleed
caused by vibration and other noise generated by the EM
actuators. Sound isolation pads further reduce propagation
of noise through a table or stand. To amplify the desired
signals, we employ a thin soundboard acoustic resonator
consistent with surfaces commonly used to amplify tuning
forks.
4.2 Implementation
Our implementation of the AAM prototype, pictured in Fig-
ure 4, implements the three active design elements listed in
Section 4.1. The components described below are the same
as those evaluated in Section 5.2. The physical components
and speciﬁcations are as follows:
•Tuning fork with a natural frequency of (ωc = 419.41 Hz),
driven at half it’s natural frequency ( ωs = 209.7 Hz).
•EM actuators (two) E-77-82 [13].
•Damping material consisting of a 0.27mm thick coated-
cloth with a synthetic rubber adhesive. In resting po-
sition, there was a small gap of approximately 2mm
between the tine of the fork and the surface of the
damping material.
•Spring suspension system consisting of three-leg base
made from 3D printed ABS plastic, two small steel
compression springs with the with a length of 35mm
and a diameter of 9mm tension springs, and adjustable
steel end-blocks.
•Sound board made from cedar wood, with the dimen-
sions 381 mm, 254 mm, 12 mm (L,W,H), resting on
laterally conﬁgured hardwood stands with the dimen-
sions 152 mm, 25 mm, 25 mm (L,W,H).
•Hardwood frame supporting and isolating the EM ac-
tuators, and acoustic isolation pads (not pictured)
lifting separately the soundboard and the hardwood
frame.
•SMSL SA-50 Class D 50 Watt ampliﬁer for the EM
actuators with signals generated on a MacBook pro
running max 7.
5. EV ALUATION AND RESULTS
5.1 Method
To compare the dynamic system model and the AAM pro-
totype, we developed three tests involving manipulation of
the modulating frequency ωr The ﬁrst test consisted of ﬁve
non-continuous modulations at ﬁxed modulator increments
of approximately 83 Hz, between 5 Hz and 420 Hz, each last-
ing 7 s, with 2 s silence in between. The second test consists
of a 40 s linear envelope function sweep from 0 Hz to 210 Hz
and back to 0 Hz. We also wanted evaluate for overmod-
ulation in the AAM prototype, so we created a third test
where ωr > ωc. This was accomplished through increasing
ampliﬁcation of the modulator ωr, resulting in additional

plitude modulation with parametric control of side-
band components.
harmonic sidebands [22]. Our rationale for developing these
comparisons was to conﬁrm our model describes the audible
sideband component behavior in common applications for
AM in music audio synthesis. The results of these tests are
presented in 5.2.
5.1.1 Synthesis Evaluation Method
To evaluate the AAM prototype and the dynamic model
together, we constructed a numerical model in Matlab to
synthesize audio using equations from Section 3. These sim-
ulations were then synthesized and analyzed in Section 5.2,
at a sampling rate of 44100 Hz at 16 bit resolution.
5.1.2 Acoustic Evaluation Method
The AAM prototype was tested in a -60dB environment,
with an Earthworks QTC50 omnidirectional microphone at
a distance from the soundboard of 20mm. The audio was
recorded in Ableton Live 9 using a Focusrite RedNet audio
interface with a True Precision pre-amp, at a sampling rate
of 44100 Hz at 16 bit resolution. The AAM prototype setup
was identical to the speciﬁcations described in Section 4.2.
Analysis was conducted using the open-source Baudline
time-frequency analyzer. We generated spectrograms using
the Fourier transform with a transform size of 32768, and
a Hanning window, with a hop-size of 256 using optimal
(100%) Drift Integration [25].
5.2 Results
Figure 5 shows the spectrograms for the three tests de-
scribed in Section 5. The model simulated the production
of primary harmonic sidebands in the modulated condition.
The third column in Figure 5 shows the results for the over-
modulation conditions. This resulted in prominent second
and third sideband harmonics, and inconsistent higher har-
monics.
Additional components, including a low-frequency sweep
in the sweep test from 0 Hz to 105 Hz to 0 Hz, and a 205 Hz
component in both tests are primarily attributable to signal-
bleed from the ωr and ωs. A third component at approx.
105 Hz appears in both the modulated and overmodulated
AAM prototype spectrograms, and is subharmonic gener-
ated from vertical oscillation of the tuning fork against the
soundboard [23]. It is interesting to also note the pertur-
bations along the linear striations in both tests. We posit
these resonances are likely resulting from nonlinearities in

modulation test (top row), continuous-sweep test (bottom row)
the physical system, speciﬁcally from the non-sinusoidal pe-
riodic motion in the TVD implementation.
Results for the non-continuous step modulation test in
the top row of Figure 5, show certain sidebands appear-
ing more clearly with certain modulator frequencies. For
instance, the ﬁrst three steps AAM prototype are clearly
accounted for in the dynamic model synthesis, whereas the
last two steps are nearly indiscernible in the modulated con-
dition and only weakly visible in the overmodulated condi-
tion. This is likely a result of eﬃciency problems in the EM
actuator discussed further in Section 5.3.
Speciﬁc to the continuous-sweep test, there are intersec-
tions of the sidebands ofωc1 and ωc2, which generate greater
sound intensity. These are shown as noticeable vertical stri-
ations in the modulated and overmodulated iterations of the
test, shown as both dark and bright streaks in the AAM pro-
totype spectrograms. These areas denote nodes and anti-
nodes, where the modulation frequency and its multiples
form relatively simple integer ratios of the carrier frequency.
Comparing the dynamic model and the AAM prototype
further shows that the loudest sidebands at 105 Hz are con-
siderably more prominent in the AAM prototype, while the
model produces strong sidebands at twice the modulating
frequency [15]. The Klang mode, roughly 6.25 times the
natural frequency, of the tuning fork is also present in the
AAM prototype evaluation.
5.3 Additional Observations
5.3.1 Improving Implementation of TVD
Additional experimentation found that the EM actuator in
the TVD system is ineﬃcient at generating displacement or
movement of mass mat frequencies above 80 Hz, with a de-
creasing eﬃciency toward an upper limit of approx. 350 Hz.
This is consistent with prior observations of EM transduc-
tion [15].
Given this limitation, it is worth noting that an EM mod-
ulated TVD system still produces AAM at signiﬁcantly
higher modulation frequencies than previous acoustic sig-
nal modulation systems discussed in Section 2. Therefore,
development of a more suitable implementation of TVD
system oﬀers the best opportunity for increasing modula-
tion frequency range and improving overall eﬃciency. This
would also allow analysis on the speciﬁc weight of sidebands
between the numerical and physical model.
Another limitation of this prototype is the relatively quiet
production of the acoustic signal, which in turn adversely ef-
fects the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Improvements might
include the use of diﬀerent acoustic ampliﬁcation, such as
horns or more eﬃcient soundboards, or through the appli-
cation of acoustic or transducer electric ampliﬁcation.
6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
6.1 AAM Prototype Extensions
Materiality is a notable feature of acoustic synthesis systems
and EM augmented instruments [5, 14]. We consider here
features that we plan to investigate in future work:
•Live Input: Substitution of the oscillator driven mod-
ulator with a signal-corrected live input.
•Feedback and DSP: Create self-feedback using a
pickup or via acoustic feedback, or using sonic trans-
ducers to modify the signal through subtractive or ad-
ditive synthesis.
12
•Multi-Degree of Freedom Systems: Generating
complex timbres using a set of harmonic oscillators
ampliﬁed on the same resonator or network of res-
onators.
•Material Variation: Utilization of diﬀerent sound-
boards, dampers, harmonic resonators, and actuators.
•Scaled Implementations: Develop a set of physi-
cal eﬀects at a diﬀerent scale that can operate inside
electronic systems [1].
6.2 Conclusion
In this paper we introduce a new approach to Acoustic Am-
plitude Modulation. Starting from prior work in acoustic
signal modulation and EM augmented instruments, we de-
velop a dynamic model to explain the underlying mechanics
of AAM. A prototype AAM instrument is implemented in
the form of a driven harmonic oscillator with controllable
time-varying damping modulation. Sonic results show that
consistent acoustic sideband components can be produced
and manipulated in an acoustic system utilizing a driven
harmonic oscillator 1.
Our results also show that a dynamic model describes
the primary sideband harmonics generated by the physical
system. AAM and more broadly, acoustic signal modula-
tion, point to a new direction in EM augmented instrument
research. It is one that oﬀers rich sonic possibilities for in-
struments and eﬀects, and nearly limitless variation through
materials, processing, and conﬁguration.
