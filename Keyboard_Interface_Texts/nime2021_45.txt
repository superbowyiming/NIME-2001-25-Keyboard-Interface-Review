ABSTRACT
Block-based coding environments enable novices to write code that bypasses the 
syntactic complexities of text. However, we see a lack of effective block-based tools 
that balance programming with expressive music making. We introduce Toneblocks1, a 
prototype web application intended to be intuitive and engaging for novice users with 
interests in computer programming and music. Toneblocks is designed to lower the 
barrier of entry while increasing the ceiling of expression for advanced users. In 
Toneblocks, users produce musical loops ranging from static sequences to generative 
systems, and can manipulate their properties live. Pilot usability tests conducted with 
two participants provide evidence that the current prototype is easy to use and can 
produce complex musical output. An evaluation offers potential future improvements 
including user-defined variables and functions, and rhythmic variability.

Introduction
The ubiquity of personal computing and internet technologies has led many educators 
to embrace programming as a means to foster creative thinking in youth. Building on 
Dewey’s philosophy of experience [1] and Piaget’s theory of constructivism [2], 
Papert’s Logo programming language enabled a hands-on approach toward learning to 
code with simple instructions and visual art [3]. Building on Logo’s innovations, 
Guzdial proposed the Media Computation approach to introducing computing in which 
learners manipulate a range of images, audio, and other media files [4]. “MediaComp” 
curricula and technologies have been widely used and adopted. As early advances in 
computing education demonstrate, an experiential and tailored approach to teaching 
supports a wide range of learners in gaining valuable problem solving skills [5]. 
Block-based programming is an increasingly common paradigm used to introduce 
novices to programming, allowing users to drag, drop, and snap together code blocks 
to form scripts [6].  This approach can be less intimidating, and it allows developers to

define and limit the available blocks to support a specific topic or activity (e.g. loop-
based music synthesis). Scratch, the most widely used block-based environment [7], 
allows users to create games and animations and manipulate sounds.
The intersection of computer programming education and music has seen a number of 
innovations including the text-based environments EarSketch [8], and Sonic Pi [9]. 
Scratch supports musical sequences and event triggering with a keyboard or controller 
like the Makey Makey [10], and has even been used as the basis for entire curricula 
introducing code through music [11][12]. However, musical content is expressed in 
plain, single-note statements (Figure 1) limiting opportunities to incorporate logic 
within musical sequences. Further, advanced uses like syncing rhythmic content 
requires difficult and unintuitive workarounds, seemingly due to a lack of an audio 
timing system. Often users opt to import music outside of Scratch for their projects 
[13]. Blocky Talky [14], another block-based programming environment, allows users 
to network and program the musical and interactive behaviors of synthesizers and 
sensing devices.
Toneblocks builds upon the foundations set by Scratch and Blocky Talky by leveraging 
modern frameworks such as the Web Audio API and reconsidering how the affordances 
of a small set of blocks might promote fun interactions with music synthesis.
Toneblocks Design
The current Toneblocks prototype consists of an interactive, block-based interface, 
audio output, and documentation. The core functionality is built on Blockly [15], a 
framework for creating block-based programming editors, and Tone.js [16], a 
framework for creating interactive music in a browser. Toneblocks is written in HTML, 
CSS, and Javascript, and is hosted via GitHub Pages. 
The interface presents a scaffolded introduction for making music with visual code and 
consists of a toolkit containing available blocks, a workspace in which they can be 
dragged, and an embedded tutorial. The toolkit includes blocks for standard datatypes

like integers and booleans, programming constructs like conditionals and lists, and 
custom music blocks such as synth, loop, and volume. The introductory tutorial 
displays a simple musical example that can be copied and run. Additional controls 
include a “Start” button, global tempo and volume sliders, and an animated 
oscilloscope. Synthesizer parameters and note inputs can be modified in real time. Live 
manipulation during playback is intended to foster a sense of play enabling users to 
jam and improvise in response to emergent features of their sound system [17].
Music Blocks
Designed entirely around synthesis and sequencing, Toneblocks introduces four new 
music blocks: synth, volume, a 4-note loop, and an 8-note loop. The synth block takes a 
unique name to handle routing, and has a drop down menu for wave type: sine, square, 
triangle, sawtooth. The loop blocks control the sequence of pitches, which are 
repeated indefinitely at the specified subdivision: 1n, 2n, 4n, 8n, 16n. Each input to the 
loop block accepts a MIDI note number or an operation that  resolves to a MIDI note 
number (Figure 3). Empty slots are rests. The vertical layout of the sequence blocks is 
intended to encourage users to build nested computational operations resulting in 
complex, generative musical scripts. While synths are monophonic, more than one can 
be dragged into the workspace enabling polyphony and rhythmic syncopation. As

indicated above, loops are editable during playback allowing users to experiment with 
computational operations and make changes based on immediate auditory feedback.
Usability Testing
We conducted an initial round of usability testing in which we asked participants to 
complete four tasks, designed to scaffold users’ introduction to Toneblocks, and then 
engage in a semi-structured interview. We hoped first to evaluate how quickly users 
understood its interface, and second to observe whether and how it could be used for 
open-ended experimentation and play. For example, Task 1 specified a musical output, 
“Create a four note loop that arpeggiates over a C Maj7 chord in eighth notes, played 
by a synth with a triangle wave oscillator…”, while Task 4 simply stated “Make music 
however you see fit.” To be clear, while Toneblocks is intended to provide an 
approachable environment introducing concepts in coding, these initial tests seek to 
capture the usability of the current, early-stage design rather than learning gains of 
the participants.
Two adults, both with college experience in music making and programming, 
participated in the experiment. Due to COVID-19, each session was conducted 
remotely within Zoom and recorded with consent for later analysis. Participants shared 
their screens while one researcher timed each task and took notes on participant 
actions and verbal feedback. The researcher did not help participants and interjected 
only when unforeseen bugs occurred, e.g. to suggest a user scroll down once a resizing

issue concealed a portion of the screen. During the semi-structured interview, the 
researcher asked users to reflect on their experiences, to identify difficulties they 
faced, and to suggest improvements.
Usability Results & Feedback
Participants completed each task with relative ease, taking under 2 minutes each to 
complete the first two, and 7-11 minutes to incorporate, randomization and logical 
operators in open-ended explorations. One participant employed low MIDI pitch values 
and multiple synth blocks to explore rhythmic sounds and syncopation, a surprising 
workaround to incorporate percussion that we had not explored in our own testing.
Participant feedback from testing sessions was largely positive and insightful. 
Participants understood how their code translated into audio, and felt that the 
computational and mathematical operant blocks allowed for randomization and 
interactivity in the music they created.
As past researchers note [18], blocks-based code often becomes difficult to navigate, 
debug, and maintain as more concurrent scripts are added in disorganized 
arrangements. Our participants' actions reflected such difficulties as their scripts grew 
in complexity. Participants noted a desire for user-defined variables and functions to 
simplify redundancies, as well as advanced musical options like variable length loops 
and note durations, and note-triggering outside of a loop.
Conclusion & Future Work
The Toneblocks prototype is a block-based musical programming web application. 
Early evidence suggests that Toneblocks presents an easily usable interface for 
creating music with blocks, despite some complications. Two users who participated in 
a usability study and interview possessed prior experience in music making and 
computer programming, and they engaged with and pushed Toneblocks accordingly. 
Testing with novices is necessary to identify barriers that users without code or music 
knowledge face. Future work will incorporate variable-length loops, note durations, 
and rhythmic patterns, as well as coding constructs including user-defined variables 
and functions. We hope that this work sparks discussion on how to approach the 
design of blocks-based interfaces to promote authentic music-making and expressive 
play.
