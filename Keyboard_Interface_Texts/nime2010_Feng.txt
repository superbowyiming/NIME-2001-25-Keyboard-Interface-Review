ABSTRACT 
 
Irregular Incurve is a MIDI c ontrollable robotic string instrument. 
The t welve i n d e p e n d e n t  s t r i n g-units compose the complete  
musical scale of 12 units . Each string can be plucked by a motor 
control guitar pick. A MIDI keyboard is attached to the instrument 
and serves as an interface for real -time interactions  b e t w e e n  t h e  
instrument and the audience. Irregular Incurve can  also play pre -
programmed music b y  i t s e l f .  T h i s  p a p e r  presents the de sign 
concept and the technical s olutions to realizing the functionality 
of Irregular Incurve. The future features are also d iscussed.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Most robotic musical inst ruments, like player pianos,  a r e  
developed based on the  prototype of traditional instrumen ts only 
for people. Unlike traditional instruments , Irregular Incurve is 
designed as an acoustic instrument played by a robot. Twelve 
strings of same thickness b u t  d i f f e r e n t  l e n g t h s  a r e  l a i d  o u t  o n  a  
sound box. The robot operates  twelve corresponding guita r picks 
to pluck each string. The musical scale of this instrument can be 
potentially expanded through connecting it with more robotic 
musical instruments of the same type . 
The design philosophy behind  Irregular Incurve is to visualize and 
enhance the aesthetic expression of the music generating process . 
The designer believes that the enjoyment of music appreciation 
does not only happen at the moment when music reaches the 
audience, but is also stimulated by watching the visual 
interactions between the musician and the instrument. Irregular 
Incurve attempts t o  enlarge this imagination about  music by 
visually expressing the beauty of mechanical movements.

2. DESCRIPTION 
2.1 Acoustic Sound 
 
Irregular Incurve applies  a similar acoustic principle a s  a 
traditional acoustic guitar does . Instead of mounting strings on the 
neck, each string is mounted on an independent steel pipe. T he 
steel pipes are fix ed onto a curved shower rod by three p i e c e s  
acrylic panels. Also mounted on the shower rod are  twelve robotic 
arms, which can pluck twelve  strings respectively with g u i t a r  
picks or mute them with fabric felt . The twelve strings are of the 
same thickness with different lengths. Each length is

mathematical calculated to get a comp lete musical scale. Through 
a guitar tuner mounted at the end of the steel pipe, the musician 
can modify the tension of the strings to generate different tones.

A hand made bridge transfers t h e  v i b r a tion of the string to a 
spruce-wood sound box that sits under all the steel pipes.  The box 
is built in an arc shape to get harmonic sound.

2.2 Robotic Motor Control 
 
In order to achieve an aesthetic movement of plucking the stri ngs, 
Irregular Incurve utilizes a combination of two servomotors for 
each robotic arm. 
 
Figure 5. Fish Wire Pull Down The Arms  
 
One motor controls the rotation of the arm; another one controls 
the up -down movement of the arm. The duplex control system 
would sacrifice the speed of plucking.  However, it enhances the 
flexibility of the mechanical mechanism and enables the robotic 
arm to perform more complicated movements  o f elegance. A 
piece of fabric felt is attached on each arm as a muting system for 
each string. The p icks are  m o u n t e d  o f f  t h e  a x i s  o f  t h e arms to 
avoid retouching the strings when move back to the original 
position. 
 
 
Figure 6. Picks Are Off The Axis Of Arms  
 
The servos using in Irregular Incurve are Hitec HS -82MG and 
Hitec HS -635HB. They bot h provide enough torque with a 
relative fast speed. The complete  movements of plucking a string 
are comprised of three steps:  
1. Rotate and move down the arm.  
2. Raise the arm. 
3. Rotate the arm back.

Figure 7. 3D Rendering of Mechanisms 
 
The movements of plucking each string  can reach a speed of one 
per second by utilizing the duplex motor system. If financially 
permitted, a control system composed of multiple high -speed 
servomotors would be considered to increase the arms’ speed to 
5~10 per second. 
One Arduino Mega and  three  Pololu micro motor controller s are 
equipped t o  program the whole set of twenty -four m o t o rs to 
complete complicated movements. Using Pololu as additional 
motor controllers allows all servomotors to work simultaneously. 
In other words, all the strings can be plucked at the same time.  
2.3 User Interface 
 
Irregular Incurve is MIDI compatible, which makes it potentially 
a uni versal performing instrument. The instrument  m a t c h e s  the 
twelve-note information to its twel ve strings. ‘Note On’ message 
indicates plucking a string. ‘Note Off’ message indicates damping 
a s t r i n g .  Because each pluck take s one second to accomplish, a 
‘Note Off’ message will not be performed within that period.  
In order to give musicians more control of this instrument , an 
additional function is added o n the keyboard. It is the ‘Mute All’ 
key, which will trigger all the arms to damp the strings.  
Also, Irregular Incurve can play algorithmic composed music by 
itself. The instrument contains  a n A rduino library, which can 
transformat the stored musical information to  c o r r e s p o n d i n g  
strings.

BACKGROUND 
 
The a e s t h e t i c  c h a r a c t e r s  o f  I r r e g u l a r  I n c u r v e  a r e  i n s p i r e d  b y  a  
virtual instrument animation (Acoustic Curve) produced by 
Animusic, a n d  GuitarBots, a  r o botic guitar instrument that  
produces rich and unique sounds.  
4. FUTURE FEATURES 
 
Servo Motor s can easily generate noise s. Audience feedback 
indicates the noises can be developed into a feature  of Irregular 
Incurve. The noise can also be controlled in a certain way to 
cooperate with musicians’ performances. 
Additionally, i nteractive light effects can be added in tune with 
the acoustic sounds produced by Irregular Incurve. 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Irregular Incurve, as an experimental prototype, achieves its goal 
of expressing both v isual and audio impact of robotic music 
generation. It is machined in a way for robots to express their own 
aesthetic character s. It is an experiment that brings  a new concept  
to robot design.
