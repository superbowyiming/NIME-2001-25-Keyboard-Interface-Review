ABSTRACT
Play and playfulness compose an essential part of our lives
as human beings. From childhood to adultness, playfulness
is often associated with remarkable positive experiences re-
lated to fun, pleasure, intimate social activities, imagina-
tion, and creativity. Perhaps not surprisingly, playfulness
has been recurrently used in NIME designs as a strategy to
engage people, often non-expert, in short term musical ac-
tivities. Yet, designing for playfulness remains a challenging
task, as little knowledge is available for designers to support
their decisions.
To address this issue, we follow a design rationale ap-
proach using the context of Live Looping (LL) as a case
study. We start by surveying 101 LL tools, summarizing
our analysis into a new design space. We then use this de-
sign space to discuss potential guidelines to address playful-
ness in a design process. These guidelines are implemented
and discussed in a new LL tool–called the “Voice Reaping
Machine”. Finally, we contrast our guidelines with previous
works in the literature.

1. INTRODUCTION
From childhood to adultness, playfulness is often associ-
ated with remarkable positive experiences related to fun,
pleasure, intimate social activities, imagination, creativity.
In NIME context, in particular, playfulness has been used
as a strategy to engage people, often non-expert, in musical
activities [22, 16, 25]. In addition, at least two other reasons
make us believe that playfulness could be a relevant topic
for NIME research.
Firstly, playfulness has been linked to several positive as-
pects potentially useful in music, such as creativity [23, 30]–

arguably essential for any artistic activity. Similarly, in the
context of computers, some potential beneﬁts include im-
proved performance, potential to improve learning, higher
user satisfaction and attitudes, and positive subjective ex-
periences [29].
Secondly, for the particular case of NIME, because clas-
sical approaches towards learning (e.g. pedagogical meth-
ods, teachers, and schools) are almost inexistent, we believe
playfulness could be a useful strategy for engaging people
in practice, yielding in the development of skills in the long
term. This direction is suggested by Oore [21] when sharing
his personal experiences in learning two NIMEs. Similarly,
in sports and psychology literature, some authors highlight
the importance of play–in addition to practice–for the de-
velopment of expertise [7].
Despite this relevance, designing for playfulness remains a
challenging task, as little knowledge is available for design-
ers to support their choices. For example: in case we want
to design a playful NIME, how should we proceed? How
can we make sure we are properly addressing playfulness in
our design? In other words, what kind of design decisions
should one make so that the resulting NIME is playful?
Figure 1: The Voice Reaping Machine.
These are the questions we try to address in this paper
by exploring the notion of playfulness in the NIME con-
text. For this goal, we follow a design rationale approach,
focusing on Live Looping (LL) as a case study. To start, we
survey 101 LL tools, summarizing our analysis into a new
design space. We use this design space to discuss potential
guidelines to address playfulness in a design process. These
guidelines are implemented and discussed in a new LL tool–
called the “Voice Reaping Machine”, presented in Figure 1.
Finally, we contrast our guidelines with previous works in
the literature.
2. BACKGROUND
87
Playfulness is an ambiguous term with diﬀerent usages in
the literature. For instance, Nijholt [20] deﬁnes that inter-
faces are playful when“users feel challenged or are otherwise
persuaded to engage in social and physical interaction be-
cause they expect it to be fun.” Alternatively, video game
researchers [5, 17] address playfulness as a quality that en-
riches products’ market value via a set of pleasurable user
experiences, such as sympathy, relaxation, or nurture.
For the context of this work, we deﬁne playfulness as a
context-speciﬁc tendency that leads people to engage in vol-
untary, inventive, and imaginative interactions with a sys-
tem [26, 29]. In this sense, it relates to open-ended inter-
actions driven by individuals’ intrinsic motivation, where
enjoyment is the ultimate goal.
The notion of playfulness has been extensively discussed
in the Human-computer Interaction (HCI) context. A de-
tailed survey is beyond the scope of this research–we rec-
ommend [29] for further details. Here, we focus on a central
issue: the state/trait nature of playfulness.
An early study to address playfulness–as deﬁned here–in
the context of HCI is [26]. The construct is deﬁned as a
trait–a pattern in an individual’s behavior that is recurrent
over time. In other words, playfulness was considered as a
characteristic present in certain personalities that yields a
predisposition to be playful–no matter the tools used in the
interaction or the context. This characteristic is also known
as “autotelic personality” [26].
On the other hand, some authors argue that playfulness
could potentially be addressed as a state–a short-timed con-
dition, where several context–speciﬁc factors related to the
interaction (e.g. the diﬃculty of the task executed, the abil-
ity of the individual in dealing with that tasks) could impact
the achievement of this playful state. In this case, the as-
sumption that the context of the interaction has little or no
impact on playfulness is no longer valid: in fact, here the
context becomes critical.
Considering playfulness as a state, [27] suggests that play-
fulness could be investigated through the lenses of the ﬂow
theory [8]. This theory relies on the ﬂow state: an opti-
mal condition, characterized by a high degree of enjoyment
and involvement, in which people become totally immersed
in performing an activity due to a perfect balance between
the challenges oﬀered by the tasks and the skills possessed
by the individual. If the activity is too easy, it yields bore-
dom; if too challenging, it yields anxiety. Dimensions that
compose ﬂow include: (1) Control, deﬁning the sense of
control users feel over the process and the activity’s out-
come; (2) Attention focus, deﬁning to what extent users
were distracted or absorbed while performing the activity;
(3) Curiosity, representing the degree of imagination and
curiosity stimulated while performing the activity; and (4)
Intrinsic interest, deﬁning to what extent users were volun-
tarily engaged and motivated by the activity.
2.1 Playfulness in NIME
There is a relatively little amount of research dedicated to
playfulness–as deﬁned here–in the context of NIME. In ad-
dition, for some of the cases that do address playfulness [16,
25], little eﬀort is made to either justify design decisions or
discuss which characteristics have made that particular de-
sign playful. Here, we cover two works that go beyond this
limitation.
The ﬁrst one is [22]. In this practice-led research, play-
fulness was used as central guideline for designing simple
fun–focused musical interfaces (i.e. toy-like instruments),
aiming at non-musicians.
Four projects are presented: (1) The Piano cubes, two
square jam jar embedded with tilt sensors, each one mapped
to the direction and the tempo of a four-notes piano arpeg-
gio; (2) The Bullroarer, a digital version of this ancient mu-
sical instrument composed of a piece of wood and a rope; (3)
The Stretch, a latex rubber surface embedded with slider
variable sensors in a square frame; and (4) The “When I
think of heaven”, a wall-sized square instrument that com-
bined four diﬀerent Stretch interfaces with two drum pads.
For each of these, the author discusses motivation and evo-
lution of the designs, summarizing his experience in three
key conclusions: (1) Novices tend to enthusiastically ex-
plore playful interfaces when these are open ended and hide
user’s lack of expertise; (2) Social collaboration can be use-
ful to encourage play; and (3) Mapping is one of the most
challenging steps in designing playful interfaces.
It is important to note that playfulness here is limited
to toy-like interfaces which, although fun and simple to
use, could potentially be quickly mastered and forgotten by
users. This characteristic is often undesirable in the context
of NIME [28].
Another example, more recent, is [19]. The author intro-
duces the D-Box, a simple and straightforward (i.e. only
three basic sensors are available for performers to interact
with) DMI that, despite its simplicity, was purposely de-
signed to be opened, and modiﬁed (i.e. hacked) by its users,
aiming at playful engagement in this hacking process. In
this sense, the author follows the idea of designing for ludic
engagement, as deﬁned by [11].
This DMI was investigated over two workshops in the
UK with 17 diverse-backgrounded participants focused on
understanding how they use the D-Box. Results–presented
according to three stages: before participants opened the
D-Box, during the hacking, and after D-Boxes were anony-
mously exchanged among participants–focused on issues such
as: (1) Sense of ownership after the hacking (i.e. partici-
pants reported connection to their own hackings, and dis-
appointment with the one received in the exchange); (2)
Patterns in the exploratory behavior when hacking the in-
strument (i.e. the caution random walk); and (3) The lim-
ited initial aﬀordances. Little is said, however, about the
design process of the instrument, and about how playfulness
was built throughout this process.
3. METHODOLOGY
Our work has four basic underlying assumptions:
1. Playfulness is a state, and because of that, people can
be more prone to playfulness depending on the char-
acteristics of the context;
2. Performers can achieve a state of playfulness in the
context of musical practice with NIME;
3. The NIME itself plays a role in achieving this playful
state (i.e. it is possible to design instruments that are
more “playfulness inducers” than others); and
4. We can foster this playfulness by addressing the con-
ditions that might lead to ﬂow.
Framed by these assumptions, our goal is to explore how
to design NIMEs that eﬀectively facilitate playfulness among
performers. For this, we decided to use a design rationale-
inspired methodology [18], aiming at describing and rea-
soning our decisions throughout our design process. Our
methodology is based on ﬁve steps: a) choose a case study ;
b) survey of existing tools ; c) create a design space ; d) ex-
ploring potential guidelines for achieving playfulness ; and e)
iteratively prototyping solutions. These steps are presented
in the following sections.
88
3.1 Choose a case study
For the scope of this study, we decided to focus on the con-
text of Live looping [2]. Live looping is a musical technique
based on looping audio samples recorded in performance
time by the performer himself/herself.
We believe that choosing LL as case study is beneﬁcial
for two reasons.
First, because LL tools share a standard set of core func-
tionalities (e.g. record, play, stop, and overdub), diﬀerent
LL tools might allow performers to achieve the same kind
of musical results (i.e. one performer could likely replicate
the same musical excerpt in diﬀerent LL tools). How these
functionalities are implemented, however, (e.g. a pedal, a
desktop application, etc.) is speciﬁc to each individual tool.
We believe this restriction is essential to allow comparison
between diﬀerent implementations.
Second, artists such as Reggie Watts1 and Dub Fx2 demon-
strate how LL tools aﬀord a new particular set of skills, built
upon their skills with their musical instruments (in the case
of these artists, the voice). This new set of skills suggests
that LL tools can be considered as musical instruments by
themselves, and are therefore representative as case study.
3.2 Survey of existing tools
There is a wide variety of devices that implement LL. As
a ﬁrst step, we have surveyed and analyzed live looping
tools produced by the music technology industry, academic
studies, and independent developers. In total, 101 tools
were surveyed. The result of this survey and analysis is
available online3.
This survey allowed us to get a sense of how designers
approached the design of new LL tools, especially concern-
ing similarities and diﬀerences of each one. This allowed us
to develop the design space [4, 13] introduced in the next
subsection.
3.3 Create a design space
From our survey of LL tools, we identiﬁed ﬁve dimensions
representing relevant aspects of LL tools. We planned to
make these dimensions orthogonal, with little or no intersec-
tion between them (the only exception concerns the visual
feedback). These dimensions are:
Looping capabilities: Deﬁnes the range of musical possi-
bilities provided by the looping device. It is a continu-
ous scale that ranges from basic (set of standard func-
tionalities consisting of record, overdub, play, stop,
and delete, as implemented in the Boss RC-1) to ad-
vanced (e.g. individual layer control, as in the Loopy)
functionalities;
Input capacity: Deﬁnes the amount of standard input
controls visible to the user for the interaction (e.g.
buttons, knobs, touch screen, etc). This dimension re-
lates to the notion of input capacity as deﬁned by [13],
concerning the capabilities of an input device for cap-
turing information from user interaction. Here, it
is represented by a continuous scale from low (as in
the Ditto Looper, which has only a foot-switch and a
knob) to high (as in the Roland MC-09, which provide
approximately 51 buttons, 8 knobs, and 4 sliders);
Mapping directness: Deﬁnes how the looping function-
alities are made accessible for the user via the input
controls. This accessibility can be direct (i.e. similar
1https://reggiewatts.com/
2https://dubfx.com/
3https://goo.gl/9a7m9Z
to an one-layer mapping [14]), when a certain func-
tionality is directly accessible to users when they use
a input control (e.g. pressing a foot-switch to record
and overdub in the Vox Lil’Looper). Contrarily, this
accessibility can be indirect (i.e. similar to a multiple-
layered mapping [14]), when users need to navigate in
the interface until the point they are able to either
enter a “looper mode” or ﬁnd the desired functional-
ity (as found in multi purpose software such as the
Ableton Live);
Visual feedback role: Deﬁnes what role visual feedback
plays in the looper. This role can be: a) Limited,
where visual feedback–if present–happens only when
user interacts with input controls (e.g. the Digitech
DL-8); b) transparent, where visual feedback allows
users to quickly infer the current status of the system
(e.g. the Boss RC-1); and c) ornamental, where visual
feedback works as aesthetic decoration for the device,
with no correspondent in terms of functionality (e.g.
the drawing aspects of the Illusio);
Visual feedback intensity: Deﬁnes how much of vi-
sual feedback the device can provide, ranging from
low (e.g. the single small LED provided by the TC
Ditto Looper), to high (e.g. the full monitor screen
visual interface of the Freewheeling).
3.4 Explore potential guidelines for achieving
playfulness
Considering this design space, our surveyed tools, and pre-
vious works in the literature, how can we design live loopers
that facilitate playfulness? We propose three key guidelines
presented in the following subsections.
3.4.1 Advanced looping capacity
All live looping tools share a basic set of functionalities that
are at the core of live looping performance (i.e. record, over-
dub, play/stop, and clear). Few are, however, the tools that
go beyond this basic set, expanding the musical possibilities
of live looping.
In order to address the conditions that may lead to ﬂow
(and therefore promoting playfulness), we argue that pro-
viding advanced looping capacity is essential. Curiosity
raised by the new musical possibilities might yield exploratory
use, which has been linked to ﬂow’s intense concentration
and enjoyment [12]. Furthermore, advanced functionalities
may aﬀord the development of new skills for expert users,
without compromising the basic functionalities for novice
users. This aspect can help users ﬁnd their own balance
between challenge and skills–essential for achieving the ﬂow
state.
One straightforward design strategy for implementing high
looping capacity is either to incorporate extra functionali-
ties provided by existing tools or to brainstorm innovative
functionalities not yet addressed these existing tools. An-
other strategy is to “absorb” expert techniques inside the
tool–as suggested by Cook’s third principle [6].
3.4.2 Low input capacity and direct mappings
Providing low input capacity means reducing the number
of standard input controls immediately visible to users for
the interaction. Additionally, providing direct mappings
means that functionalities–both basic and advanced–should
be directly accessible via input controls.
The motivation is trying to make the device easier to get
started with by: a) reducing confusion that a high num-
ber of input controls may cause to new users; and b) cou-
pling the reduced number of input controls with the usage
89
of direct mappings (e.g. arguably, providing a single button
for navigating many diﬀerent functionalities could result in
more challenging initial ease of use). This aspect, again,
could help users with diﬀerent levels of expertise to ﬁnd the
balance between challenge and skills required for ﬂow.
Another argument is that, because mappings are direct,
performers could spend less time dealing with actions that
do not have a direct impact in the musical outcome (e.g.
interface navigation). As a result, we allow them to better
focus their attention on the musical activity–another key
requirement for the ﬂow state.
It is important to note that this guideline does not neces-
sarily yield NIMEs that are“easy to use”or“easy to master”.
The number of input controls can be low and their mapping
direct, but still it may be challenging to meaningfully con-
trol them in a musical sense. A practical example is the
theremin, which, despite intuitive and easy to get started,
is arguably hard to master. This idea of instruments with
“low entry fee and high ceilings”, discussed in [28].
3.4.3 Transparent and intense visual feedback
This guideline means that visual feedback should be pro-
vided and guided towards: a) allowing user and the audi-
ence to infer what is going on inside the device (i.e. visual
feedback should be transparent); and b) exploring highly
visible visual displays as output, so that they can be easily
perceived by performer and audience.
The importance of visual feedback for NIME has been
discussed by several previous works [9, 24]. We believe this
guideline may facilitate playfulness and ﬂow because it may
help in promoting transparency–that is, how much people
(mainly the audience and non-expert users) perceive the
connection between the performer’s gestures and the sounds
produced [10]. Furthermore, visual feedback also aﬀords
potential to make the tool more intuitive [15], contributing
for initial ease of use.
Some concrete strategies on how to implement this guide-
line can be found in the literature. Examples include using
visual metaphors, and exploring perceptual sound parame-
ters (e.g. loudness) [1].
3.5 Iteratively prototype solutions
The previously mentioned guidelines led us to develop low-ﬁ
prototypes of new live looping devices–represented in Fig-
ure 2 4. Some of them evolved to the “Voice reaping ma-
chine”, that is presented in the next section.
4. IMPLEMENTATION
The LL tool designed to implement these guidelines is called
the Voice Reaping Machine (VRM)–already presented in
Figure 1. The tool is composed by: a) an iPad application
developed in C++/Openframeworks; and b) a modiﬁed-
keyboard that works as two foot-switches.
In the following subsections we discuss how we imple-
mented each guideline in this particular prototype.
4.1 Advanced looping capacity
In addition to the standard basic functionalities, the VRM
presents three innovative functionalities when compared to
existing LL tools: a) the capacity of easily setting the play-
back position of the looping; b) the capacity of easily reset-
ting a new looping area inside the original loop; and c) the
capacity of creating additional voices to the loop, by com-
bining either two playback positions or two looping areas
4Videos of these prototypes can be found in: https://
youtu.be/7OpCP26LXxA; https://youtu.be/CAiVWvVFaqI;
and https://youtu.be/oRpVfqern6s
Figure 2: Several prototypes were designed for
exploring our guidelines. In addition to paper
sketches, we also built (A) a video prototype; (B)

ble; and (C) another functional prototype using the
computer’s trackpad.
playing together at the same time. This process is shown
in Figure 3.
The combination of these functionalities makes the VRM
unique when compared to existing LL alternatives, provid-
ing it with a peculiar advanced looping capacity.
4.2 Low input capacity and direct mappings
Concerning the standard basic functionalities, the VRM em-
ulates the foot pedal-based interaction style used by the
most simple loopers in our survey. As a consequence, all
standard basic functionalities are directly accessible via the
modiﬁed keyboard. For example, to record, the user needs
to press the foot-switch at the beginning and again at the
end points of the musical phrase to be looped. The same ac-
tions allow overdubbing if executed whenever some musical
material is looping. Play and stop can be also be directly
accessed via the foot-switch. Clearing is possible by holding
the main foot-switch by two seconds.
Regarding the three advanced functionalities, they were
made accessible via incremental touch interaction and di-
rect manipulation of the object of interest (the sample), as
follows:
One ﬁnger added: The user is able to control the play-
back position of the looper (the ﬁnger X position), and
the volume of the playback (ﬁnger Y position);
Two ﬁngers added: The user is able to set a looping
subarea, where the begin position is the left-most ﬁn-
ger X position, and the end position is the right-most
ﬁnger X position. In both case, volume is deﬁned by
interpolation of the Y position of both ﬁngers;
Three ﬁngers added: In this case, users can perform
both actions deﬁned above at the same time. In other
words, they can: a) set and control a looping subarea

ﬁngers result in redeﬁning the looping area; (C) three ﬁngers result in controlling the playback position and

Four ﬁngers added: Here, users are able to select two
looping subareas (as a doubled ‘two-ﬁngers added’).
4.3 Transparent and intense visual feedback
Visual feedback is at the core of the VRM, and was de-
signed in order to highlight the high level mechanisms of
the looper [3]. It basically consists of a timeline showing
the waveform of the recorded loop and a gray line indicat-
ing the playback position of the loop. In addition, live audio
input is provided by the interface, in order to allow input
monitoring.
All elements are responsive to user actions (e.g. recording
or overdubbing changes to background color to red, areas
outside a looping subareas are made gray, and so on), al-
lowing performer and audience to infer accurately what is
happening inside the device (i.e. transparency). For this
goal, all the tablet screen is dedicated to the interface, in
order to maximize visual feedback intensity.
5. DISCUSSION
We note that there is still some open questions raising from
our work. For instance: If the VRM is more playful than
other LL tools, is it because of the strategies we used?
What consequences would this playfulness bring for the LL
practice–in particular, for user engagement, willingness for
practice, and skill development?
To clarify these questions, further empirical investigations
are needed. Such studies would complement the formative
evaluation used here, derived from our design rationale-
inspired methodology, and would allow us to concretely as-
sess strengths and weaknesses of the VRM.
Finally, our guidelines were contrasted to other guidelines
from the literature. This contrast is summarized in Table 1.
Despite the diﬀerent contexts (musical toys, live looping,
etc), it is interesting to note how the idea of simple interac-
tion seems somehow always present–by allowing novices to
simply produce musical results above their capacity [22]; by
exploring everyday objects potentially familiar to users [25];
or by providing a low input capacity as proposed here. We
believe further research is needed in this direction.
6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have explored the notion of playfulness
for NIMEs, speciﬁcally in the context of live looping tools.
Our main contributions are: a) a survey and analysis of 101
existing LL tools; b) the deﬁnition of a design space for LL;
c) a set of design guidelines for playful LL tools, using our
design space as baseline; and d) a practical implementation
of these guidelines in a new LL tool, the “Voice Reaping
Machine”. In the larger picture, we hope these contribu-
tions can provide some preliminary knowledge on how to
eﬀectively address playfulness in a NIME design.
