ABSTRACT
In this paper we draw a picture that captures the increas-
ing interest in the format of modular synthesizers today.
We therefore provide a historical summary, which includes
the origins, the fall and the rediscovery of that technol-
ogy. Further an empirical analysis is performed based on
statements given by artists and manufacturers taken from
published interviews.These statements were aggregated, ob-
jectiﬁed and later reviewed by an expert group consisting of
modular synthesizer vendors. Their responses provide the
basis for the discussion on how emerging trends in synthe-
sizer interface design reveal challenges and opportunities for
the NIME community.

1. INTRODUCTION
Over the last ten years a constant growth of the interest in
modular synthesizers (short: modulars) could be observed
(see Figure 2). New specialized companies were set up, ded-
icated to this format, trade fairs (Suberbooth, KnobCon,
SynthFest) appeared all over the world to give a wider audi-
ence access to this previously relatively unknown/forgotten
technology. But where does all this interest come from?
Contrary to our Western mindset of progress and consume-
ﬁxation, where typically new technologies surpass outdated
ones, it now seems that musicians are actively choosing re-
gression. They prefer limited devices as analog synthesizers
over the more ﬂexible machines they use everyday such as
PCs and smart/mobile devices. At ﬁrst glance this may
seem illogical or even paradoxical - like a step back on the
ladder of evolution - but comparable with Darwin’s ﬁnches,
who developed highly specialized beaks or with dwarf ele-
phants who lost their body size (allopatric speciation), we
as musicians also adapt, consciously or unconsciously, to
internal and external inﬂuences (needs vs. zeitgeist).

What can we as designers, researchers and developers do
to learn from this development and create concepts, ideas
and tools for the musician of tomorrow?
In summary this paper contributes to the community by
capturing the current state of cultural and social impact
of modular synthesizers and provides starting points for re-
search and design experimentations based on these insights.
2. A HISTORY OF THE MODULAR
With the advent of broadcast technologies in the ﬁrst half of
the 20th century (radio, telephone), engineers and inventors
began to apply their new knowledge to the ﬁeld of music in
order to solve contemporary problems. The ampliﬁcation
of the voice and of acoustic instruments in the context of
ever louder live music [12] as well as the creation of new
instruments, that support the low frequency spectrum of
bands, led to new artistic expressions [13] as well as creative
possibilities. Soon they realized that they could use the
same technological building blocks, they already used for
ampliﬁcation and sonic manipulation of real world noises,
to generate new, to this date even unheard, sounds.
2.1 The Rise
The brake through of such sound generators came with
the industrialized manufacturing of transistors [5] which re-
placed the tube as the former key building block of electron-
ics and led to cheaper, smaller and more durable devices.
As two pioneers of audio synthesis Robert Moog and Don-
ald Buchla [21] independently developed synthesizers on the
East and West Coast of the United States in the 1960s.
Although both systems were able to generate sounds both
used diﬀerent technological approaches as well as mindsets
for their machines. Moog focussed on subtractive synthesis
(frequencies are dampened/removed from harmonically rich
waveforms such as square waves) whereas Buchla designed
additive synthesizers (harmonically pure waveforms such as
sine waves get sonically enriched by folding). As diﬀerent
as their synthesis techniques, they designed completely dif-
ferent interfaces for controlling their sound generators.
Where Buchla designed new interface paradigms to open
up musicians’ minds (sequencers, logic an trigger modules
leading to algorithmic compositions), Moog identiﬁed the
musicians’ need to ﬁnd familiar input methodologies (key-
board: see Figure 1.2) to ease the entry to the easily over-
whelming possibilities of audio synthesis. Moog’s approach
led to a huge commercial success and helped to establish
the synthesizer in popular music. The inﬂuence of Buchla’s
machines is still present in generative and experimental elec-
tronic music [8] today. Both approaches are indeed diﬀer-
ent in the way they are played and controlled, but similar
in the way the signal ﬂow is patched. With patch cables
musicians could route the audio signals and control voltages
(CV) of basic modules (VCO, VCF, LFO, ENV, VCA). The
same set of modules opens up nearly inﬁnite routing vari-
ants to constantly generate new sounds, melodies, or noises.
The patching approach was inspired from switchboards (see
Figure 1.1) popularized through the telephone. Jacks for
injecting CV and knobs/faders for manually entering such
voltages were the interface of choice [3].
2.2 The Fall
The fall of the the analog modular began with the advent
of polyphonic synthesizers and portable consumer products
(Minimoog1) [20]. Beside the advantages of analog syn-
thesis, this technology also had some drawbacks. Analog
circuitry needed heat up time to hold tune and even af-
ter preheating, the synthesizers’ tune still drifted causing
problems during live performances or recording sessions.
Further, building polyphonic modular systems was expen-
sive and space consuming. The production of chip sets that
performed as VCOs, VCFs and VCAs helped to build and
decrease the costs polyphonic instruments. These products
came internally pre-patched and in smaller packages than
modulars. They contained key-beds, control wheels and well
designed user interfaces, had fewer sound design capabilities
as modulars but convinced due to simplicity and convenient
handling. Patch bays and jacks for injecting CV and audio
disappeared from synthesizer’s control surfaces. Faders and
knobs were the interface of choice [2].
The development of the FM (frequency modulation) tech-
nology for broadcasting applications in the 1930s opened up
a new method of sound synthesis in the 1980s. The dig-
ital implementation of FM synthesis done by Yamaha in
the 1970s led to synthesizers (DX7: see Figure 1) which
convinced with sounds that could neither be produced by
additive nor by subtractive synthesis [6] and brought tun-
ing stability and sound presets to further ease synthesizers’
handling. FM synthesis positioned itself as the deﬁning
sound of the 80s and outperformed analog systems in price,
polyphony and stability, therefore contributing to the de-
cline of analog synths which were displaced to large studios
or collectors. Personal computers, calculators (see Figure
1.3), digital watches and game consoles made their way into
the homes of thousands of families in the 80s and made dig-
ital products and sound sources prominent in the consumer
market and in listening habits. This opened up the advent
of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) [26]. Interfaces of digi-
tal synthesizers adapted to current technologies. Faders and
knobs were mainly replaced by buttons and displays.
2.3 The Renaissance
With computers becoming ubiquitous, powerful and thus in-
dispensable the computer today often totally replaces phys-
ical gear. Software instruments, virtual emulations of iconic
equipment and music applications oﬀer independence of mu-
sic hardware. Advantages are space and portability related,
a reduction in price leading to better accessibility for new
societal groups but mainly of practical nature with features
as preset managing and handling the whole process all in

Table 1: 35 Eurorack-manufacturers evaluated 20 statements with a 7-level Likert-scale (-3, +3). The inter
quartile range (IQR) was used as a measure of clustering around the median (m). Items of very high cluster
(IQR <= 1.5) or high spread ( IQR >= 3) are shown above. The full questionnaire and the results can be
viewed at https://goo.gl/forms/HYY7cI99w3bRsPrS2.
(2-44 yrs) and they have been running their companies for
6 years (1-27 yrs) on average. All participants agreed that
their data is used anonymized for scientiﬁc publications.
4.3 Anaylsis
In the following section the items of the questionnaire, which
provoked the highest polarization (see Table 1), are ana-
lyzed. As a measurement for the responses’ spread we used
the interquartile range ( IQR) [17]. It shows the grade of
cluster thereby low values indicate high clustering whereas
high values indicate high spread of the responses around
the median (m). By choosing thresholds we excluded some
statements from closer examination.
4.3.1 High Cluster
The items S2, S7, S16 and S18 were related to the hard-
ware aspects of modulars and focus on the emotional con-
nection people create to physical objects ( S2, S16, S18)
as well as to their inviting character which fosters hands-on
experimentation (S7). Both aspects are important factors
diﬀerentiating virtual from haptic real-world objects. In-
struments have a long tradition as design objects and some
musicians build up really personal relationships to their in-
struments. The tactile experience of a physical object com-
bined with the creational aspect of realizing musical think-
ing in building a modular system also support this bonding.
The aspect of a modular system as a creative tool is
present in items S9 and S14. S9 is concerned with the
idea of a modular system being a creative partner in the
performance context. By introducing randomness and al-
gorithmic patterns, musical ideas arise that musicians typi-
cally not think about. In this way, the system becomes more
of a partner rather than a tool. Musicians can design their
systems to be the assistance they need ( S14) or to be the
empty canvas they want to create music with. Either way,
the system becomes an extension of the musician helping to
compensate or to realize.
4.3.2 High Spread
Items S1 and S5 are both concerned with social interac-
tion. First, in the context of musician-audience interrelation
(S5) and second, in respect to musician-musician interrela-
tion (S1). Both statements are traceably controversial, thus
e.g. learning from and with others is mainly dependent on
character features like openness and extraversion [7] and
not on the used platform (digital vs. analog, pc vs. hard-
ware). The same goes for the musician-audience interaction.
However, the high dissent shows that some manufacturers
believe in the idea that improvisation based live sets can
create strong emotions that transfer to the audience.
Item S4 is concerned with the statement that the PC
as a tool creates pressurizing expectations. The underly-
ing consideration is that productivity, workﬂow and speed
experienced in every day work and social interaction have
an eﬀect on musician’s subconscious expectations when per-
forming music with such machines. Software used in music
production today is a likewise optimized tool to support
productivity. A growing number of musicians want to slow
down when making electronic music and explore creatively
instead of pursuing concrete goals, comparable to taking a
short break and jamming on a guitar. Apparently, this is
dependent on the person, its objectives and the context.
A trend you can follow on social media is the exploitation
of nature by electronic musicians such as jamming in the
woods or in other remote spots. This can be compared to
the art movement En plein air where artists left the ateliers
to capture their motifs directly in nature (see Figure 3).
Diﬀerent mindsets about modular synthesizer interface
design are questioned in itemS12 and S20. A lot of synthe-
sists are analog purists and refuse even the slightest digital
346
inﬂuence in the modules they use. Topics like the usage of
screens/ displays (S12) to pack more layers of functionality
into such modules are highly discussed. Even the intro-
duction of shift buttons ( S20) to give access to alternative
functions is sometimes a momentum of disruption for some
musicians. Comparable to ”what you see is what you get”
exists the idea of ”one knob per function” in the context of
music interfaces. For a lot of people this is the optimum way
to design and control synthesizers because everything that
can be controlled is always controlled by the elements you
see on the instrument. Others instead strive for ﬂexibility
and variety in their modules and therefore accept increased
complexity and reduced directness as a consequence.
High disagreement under the participants was also pro-
voked by item S12 which stated the diﬃculty for musicians
to picture musical outcomes or to translate musical ideas
into sound when performing with modulars. This statement
is related to the context of comparing synthesizers to acous-
tic instruments. Experienced instrumentalists can ”think”
music before they actually play it based on the instrument’s
(guitar, piano, etc.) physical behavior, their experience and
motor memory. Synthesizers and especially modulars are
harder to predict partly because of their ”re-patchability”
and further because of the often-used complex synthesis
techniques. Even a small set of modules can generate a
wide palette of sounds and are not controlled as direct as
acoustic instruments because additional control-layers (se-
quencers, etc.) separate musicians from their instruments.
5. DESIGN CHALLENGES AND OPPOR-
TUNITIES
Condensed from the previous section the following aspects
help to deﬁne design challenges worthwhile for the NIME
community to consider:
Object Character: What musicians appreciate about mod-
ulars is the immediacy the instrument has as an object.
Turning it on, twisting knobs and patching cables happens
instantaneously. Further they enjoy to touch, to watch and
to care about the instrument.
Personalization and Flexibility: Identiﬁcation with these
instruments happens based on the eﬀort people put into
their systems during the design and assembly. Making the
instrument their own based on the needs and preferences
they have and condensing the possibility space down to a
personal and ﬂexible solution.
Instruments as Creative Extensions: The modular syn-
thesizer becomes more than just a tool for most synthesists.
From a blank canvas to a supportive environment, it can be
anything a musician imagines.
Experimentation and Randomness : By creatively ex-
ploring the capabilities of a system and working with sources
of uncertainty the musician positions themself as an ex-
plorer. Musical outcomes are thus results of discovery voy-
ages instead of plain ﬁxated work. 3
Directness: The dividing factor between acoustic and elec-
tronic instruments is the directness between input and out-
put. Interaction with acoustic instruments generates direct
results based on the interwoven sound determining factors
whereas audio synthesis recreates this interrelation and of-
ten limits the interaction to an indirect parameter level.
Individualism and Uniqueness : The modular, with its
patchable signal ﬂow, not only oﬀers huge ﬂexibility and
thus possibilities for sound-design, but also force the mu-
sician to go beyond presets. The absence of presets to re-
call custom or factory sounds or to save them for later use
3Philip Sherburne: pitchfork.com
Figure 4: COMB acts as a typical step sequencer,
beside that instruments are selected by changing
the interface’s shape. (COMB on vimeo)
pushes the synthesist to ever new territories. The other way
around, it is also harder for others to replicate, therefore it
is a good choice if one aims for unique and individual results.
Further trends that were addressed in some of the state-
ments and their analysis above but are even more present
in social media and online communities are:
En plein air : The studio as the main place of creation
is extended by musicians making music on the go (down-
scaled, light weight, self-contained). Electronic musicians
are thus empowered to exploit nature and remote places to
perform, create and capture music. Nature is incorporated
dialogue-like into the process.4
DAWless: The computer is rationalized from setups as
the source of control. The modular moves towards being a
highly specialized Digital Audio Workstation for its owner.5
DIY and Open Hardware: The DIY and open hardware
culture [22] acts as a fertilizing factor. Now, the community
itself becomes the innovation and driving force replacing the
big players. Creative minds are empowered and supported
through divided knowledge and open resources to create
new modules. The accessibility of DIY kits acts as an entry
to the domain of electronics and as a pool of inspiration.
6. DISCUSSION
Considering our investigations in retrospective we acknowl-
edge that many of the previously mentioned concepts are
already part of the NIME community’s spirit [18]. Build-
ing upon these concepts, we focus, in our own research,
on explorability, meaning playful interaction as well as on
the incorporation of haptics for instance of shape as an in-
put method. Here, our modular interface COMB [24] al-
lows functionality changes by reconﬁguring the shape of the
modular interface inspired by children’s play with building
blocks (see Figure 4). The main opportunities we have right
now as user experience designers are based on the new open-
ness consisting of user’s desire for exploration and their will
to participate in the design and development process.
The challenges we have to tackle consist of giving our
interfaces relevance in everyday situations. Direct and im-
mediate use as well as feedback are the core of a close and
persistent musician-instrument relationship. Flexibility and
personalization of instruments, not meaning to superﬁcially
mimic modulars by adopting patch points and CV capabil-
ities but oﬀering highly customizable solutions to open up
great potential for creative and artistic evolvement. Porta-
bility and independence from PCs will allow for new free
and experimental use cases and freedom in when and where
electronic musicians perform their music.

Beneﬁts and Limitations : By providing our results we
acknowledge that we have only selected a small sample size
in speciﬁc regions of the world to conduct our research sur-
vey on Eurorack manufactures. Hence, it would be too far
fetched to summarize our insights as general global trends.
On the other hand our research ﬁndings reﬂect reoccur-
ring patterns of manufacturers thoughts and actions which
all share similar goals: supporting a physical interface ex-
perience when experimenting with electronic music gener-
ated through synthesizers. We conclude that there is a real
user need that is fueled by both active musicians that take
pleasure in using a more expressive and emotional stimu-
lating physical medium instead of interacting solely with
screen based interfaces and hardware manufacturer that
correspond to this user need by providing suitable hardware
solutions. In our ongoing and future research work we will
therefore address these circumstances by experiments with
ﬂexible and modular interfaces that could provide further
usability advantages in this domain.
7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In summary we have reported on the evolutionary and con-
temporary turn in the development and utilization of analog
modular synthesizers. We consider the current device de-
velopment of many manufactures as a strong indication for
a return of tactile experiences in this domain reﬂected by
the interface components losing their pure digital nature.
In the near future we aim at further substantiating our re-
search through insights and prototypes. An extension of our
survey focussing on musicians will address the next phase
of tackling persisting questions in this domain. Further, the
reduction in component costs of sensors and display mate-
rials (e.g. ﬂexible display solutions) provides an extension
of the design space and includes items (ﬂexible physical in-
terfaces) we will take in close consideration for our future
interface explorations.
