ABSTRACT
This paper presents WELLE, a web-based music environ-
ment for blind people, and describes its development, de-
sign, notation syntax and ﬁrst experiences. WELLE is in-
tended to serve as a collaborative, performative and educa-
tional tool to quickly create and record musical ideas. It is
pattern-oriented, based on textual notation and focuses on
accessibility, playful interaction and ease of use.
WELLE was developed as part of the research project
Tangible Signals and will also serve as a platform for the
integration of upcoming new interfaces.

1. INTRODUCTION
Using the computer for music production is exciting and
opens up possibilities that are only achievable with digital
electronic instruments. Not only sound generation, but also
the integration of a multitude of interfaces is often a starting
point for creative processes. If, however, the computer has
to be used with assistive technologies - as is the case for
blind people - digital music production quickly becomes a
challenge that can only be realized with a lot of preparation
and external help. Diﬃculties do not only arise during the
initial installation of new software. Also, the integration of
devices such as the Braille keyboard or the Braille display
into the computer system is challenging. When it comes
to computer music software, a widespread problem is the
integration and the accessibility support for screen readers1,
and therefore the support of Braille devices.

To improve the process of music production on the com-
puter for the blind, several attempts have been made in
the past focusing on assistive external hardware, such as
the Haptic Wave [14], the HaptEQ [6] or the Moose [5].
All these external interfaces, however, are based on the in-
tegration into a music production environment. But only
very few audio software platforms support screen readers
like JAWS. Amongst them is the cross-platform audio soft-
ware Audacity. Yet in terms of music production, Audacity
is only suitable for editing single audio ﬁles, but not for
more complex editing of multiple audio tracks or even for
composing computer music. DAW’s (Digital Audio Work-
stations) like Sonar or Reaper allow more complex audio
processing and also oﬀer screen reader integration, but us-
ing them with the screen reader requires extensive training.
2. COMPUTERMUSIC AND CODE
While the interaction with the GUI and thus the use of
a screen reader can be demanding, some blind people are
much faster and more intuitive when writing and reading
program code. Highly trained blind software developers and
programmers like Florian Beijers, Michael Forzano, Her-
win Haliman and many others2 work alongside sighted col-
leagues. The only diﬀerence to the way their sighted col-
leagues work is their use of screen readers and their ability
to memorize once written and read code better than their
colleagues.
2.1 Coding for Kids
Coding is also already used to inspire and teach children and
teenagers. Educational projects that deal with the play-
ful learning of programming skills through physical objects
such as Torino and its successor Code Jumper [11], or with
regard to sound generation, the Little Bits project [12], have
gained huge attention. On the software side, tools like the
visual programming language Scratch, or Sam Aaron’s and
Alan Blackwell’s groundbreaking work on the Sonic Pi [2][3],
which even runs on the single board computer Raspberry
Pi, illustrate the success this approach can have and have
been used in numerous classroom workshops and live per-
formances. Unfortunately, Scratch is not useful for blind
children [4].
2.2 Audio Programming Languages
Thus, programming could oﬀer an obvious approach to-
wards the computer as music machine for blind people.
There are already numerous music-oriented programming
languages, such as Csound or SuperCollider [16], that use

text editors as their main interfaces. Some of them even
were primarily developed for the practice of livecoding, e.g.
TidalCycles [10] or Overtone [1]. Particularly interesting for
blind beginners are systems like the aforementioned Sonic
Pi or ixi lang [7], that work with reduced complexity and
highly abstracted programming language.
However, regarding blind users, problems can also arise
with text-based music environments: often the installation
of software itself poses a challenge, or the user interfaces are
not optimized for screen readers and Braille devices, e.g. the
SuperCollider IDE or Sonic Pi IDE.
2.3 W eb-based audio programming
Web apps avoid having to install software and run on com-
mon browsers, and screen readers are able to navigate most
websites.
Web-based music platforms, that use a simpliﬁed pro-
gramming language are already available, such as Livecode-
lab 2.5, SLANG, Punctual and more. Their highly ab-
stracted language quickly explains itself to beginners and,
after a short exploration, encourages to make music. To
what extent these speciﬁc web apps are accessible for screen
reader and Braille devices, will be discussed below.
However, despite a wide variety of existing music plat-
forms and approaches, it is still diﬃcult to ﬁnd accessible
tools for sound creation, that can easily be used by the
blind.
3. WELLE - A SIMPLIFIED MUSIC
ENVIRONMENT
To oﬀer a simple, collaborative and playful music environ-
ment based on just-in-time programming to blind people,
and in order to overcome barriers like software installa-
tion or incomplete screen reader integration, the WELLE
platform was developed. A live version is accessible under
https://tangible.uber.space/
The development of this web app is part of the research
project Tangible Signals [15], which focuses on the physical
representation of sound and haptic control feedback. For
this project a collaboration with blind and visually impaired
pupils was initiated that led to the creation of WELLE. The
app will also serve as a platform for integrating interfaces,
that will be built in the course of the research.
3.1 Concept and development
The concept for WELLE was developed during several work-
shops at the Institute for the Blind in Vienna while work-
ing with a group of ﬁve pupils aged 12-14 years and their
teacher. The teacher and four of the pupils were blind and
one pupil was partially sighted.
In search for a suitable and accessible music platform for
this workshop, several sound platforms were presented to
the group and were explored by the participants during the
workshop. The selection focused on web-based livecoding
platforms in order to use text as musical interface and to
circumvent any software installation, so that the partici-
pants could also rehearse also on their computers at home
for example. The platforms Gibber and Lich [13][9] were
excluded from the exploration because their interface was
not accessible at the time to the screen reader and their
programming language was rather complex for beginners.
For the same reasons Audiomasher, Herokuapp, Wavepot,
8bitworkshop, SOUL, FAUST, Klangmeister, Estuary and
also the online DAW Earsketch were excluded.
The preselected platforms were the Livecodelab 2.5 3,
3https://livecodelab.net/play/
SLANG4 and Punctual 5 were chosen because of their sim-
pliﬁed programming language and because a screen reader
could at least navigate the website.
However during the exploration in the workshop none of
the chosen platforms were functional and accessible when
used with screen readers and Braille displays. As a result,
without installing software on the computers provided by
the school, the participants of this workshop could not re-
ceive an eﬀective introduction to sound generation.
Since other web-based platforms than those already men-
tioned are not known to the author, the conclusion of this
ﬁrst exploration, is that none of the existing web-based live-
coding platforms were either accessible or suitable for the
blind and visually impaired participants of the workshop.
As a consequence, and in order to provide a musical tool
based on a textual interface to the pupils for the next work-
shop, a ﬁrst web-based prototype was created (Figure 1),
featuring very basic text commands to trigger sounds. But
more importantly, an accessible web design and audio feed-
back were integrated. The resulting web app consisted
of several subpages, which enabled users to play, stop or
change prepared sample loops. Available subpages were
drums, bass, melody, pads, hihats and vocals. The pupils
could choose one instrument, open the corresponding sub-
page on their computer and start experimenting. Initially
all pupils in the room were using their headphones, since
they could not only hear the audio samples, but also the
screen reader information. Later the headphones were un-
plugged in order to hear the group’s overall sound.

In the discussion with the participants about another it-
eration of this website, various aspects were addressed:
- simple languagethe text commands should allow broader
interaction with the sound, but should stay simple and
easy to remember
- assistive design apart from being optimized for the use
with screen reader, the design of the website should be
assistive, e.g. the cursor should jump directly to the
input ﬁeld after loading the page, also audio feedback
should be integrated, e.g. indicating input errors
- audio recording it should be possible to record and down-
load the created music
- collaboration a collaboration across multiple computers
should be possible

3.2 Software design
Based on the results of the ﬁrst workshops described above,
WELLE was developed as a simpliﬁed music environment,
accessible to blind people, that runs in a browser and is
based on a textual interface. The core component is a text-
based notation system, that according to Magnusson’s book
Sonic Writingcould be described as a hybrid between live-
coding and “action notation” [8]. The notation is heavily
inspired by Livecodelab 2.5, ixi lang and Steno (SuperCol-
lider) and allows intuitive access to pattern-based sound
generation through simpliﬁcation and abstraction.
For the creation of the syntax the parser generator Ohm-
lang was used 6. The website is programmed in Javascript
and HTML 7 and utilizes the Tone.js library for sound gen-
eration. The web app runs on standard browsers, except
the IE Internet Explorer, which was commonly used in the
school environment where the workshops took place, along-
side Mozilla’s Firefox.
3.3 Interface design
The interface of the web app (Figure 2) is text-based and
centred around an input ﬁeld, which serves as main interac-
tion element. All elements are programmed with regard to
accessibility e.g. as text, tables or check boxes. The main
elements from top to bottom are:
- Control sectionvarious control options, e.g. mute switches
for the entire sound or for alerts, an overview about
the status of recordings, media player and groups
-Command history an overview of all commands entered.
The arrow keys can be used to recall commands. In
group sessions the history is shared between all par-
ticipants
- Input ﬁeld commands can be entered and will be exe-
cuted by hitting the return key
- Instrument overview a list of all active instruments
and parts
- Help section an overview of all commands and interac-
tive examples
3.4 Notation syntax
WELLE’s underlying principle is based on sequences of re-
peated patterns. By entering patterns for a speciﬁc instru-
ment, a sequence is created that loops after it has reached
its last step. If patterns of diﬀerent lengths are entered,
polyrhythmic loops are created. Shorter patterns will loop
earlier. The instruments run in sync with each other. To
start an instrument, its name followed by a pattern has to
be entered in the input ﬁeld and has to be sent to evaluation
by pressing return. The pattern can consist of a hash ’#’
for a hit, and a minus ’-’ for a pause. The pitch of a note or
respectively the sample rate of a sample can be altered by
adding a number after the hash. Examples of expressions:
bass # - # # - - #
drums #2 # - # #3 #2 -
drums> bass
save mybeat
. bass
>
6https://ohmlang.github.io/, the use of Ohmlang was
inspired by SLANG
7other used frameworks are Node.js, Websockets and
Socket.io
Typing an instrument name followed by a pattern starts
the instrument. Typing a dot ’.’ followed by the instru-
ment name stops the instrument. Using ’.’ or ’>’ without
additional speciﬁcation name will stop and start the whole
sequence.
Patterns can be copied to other instruments, using the ’ >’
character. Patterns can also be combined and abstracted
by using brackets. Every instrument oﬀers some additional
parameters, e.g. instrument volume and randomization of
the pattern. When randomizing an instrument, e.g. ’rand 2
drums’, the note and rest events of the underlying pattern
will be randomized after the pattern ﬁnished two cycles.
The tempo of the whole sequence can also be changed, e.g.
using ’BPM 132’. Moreover, slowly increasing or decreas-
ing tempo changes are also possible by adding a number,
which determines the seconds of the transition. Most of
those functions can also be applied to multiple instruments
at the same time.
Regarding compositions, it is possible to save individual
parts while playing. They are snapshots of the current ac-
tive collection of instruments, patterns and other parame-
ters such as volume and randomizing. These parts are then
displayed below the input ﬁeld and can be reactivated at any
time. They can be used to e.g. structure a performance.
Other features are network collaboration, preset storage, in-
teraction alerts, recordings of the session. The help section
at the bottom of the website contains interactive examples
and more detailed explanations of implemented features.

4. WORKSHOP
The WELLE web app was ﬁrst used at theOCC - Austrian
Computer Camp during a 3-hour workshop with a group of
six pupils aged 10-14 years, of whom ﬁve were blind and one
was visually impaired. Also, two blind teachers participated
in the workshop.
The pupils were using their private computers. None of
the pupils had prior experience with computer music or pro-
gramming. Within the ﬁrst hour the pupils got used to
WELLE’s notation syntax, commands and pattern genera-
tion, and were able to create musical results, which at the
end of the workshop were presented to an audience of 20
participants and supervisors of the computer camp.
The experience gained at the workshop shows, that the
web app is accessible to the blind. All elements of the
app were accessible to the screen reader. Furthermore, the
teachers that participated in the workshop, conﬁrmed the
ease of use and the musical capabilities of the website. None
of the teachers and supervisors of the computer camp were
aware of a platform that enables blind children to create
sounds so easily and playfully.
5. CONCLUSIONS
Despite a wide variety of music production software, music
programming environments and web-based audio platforms,
blind people are still excluded from using the computer as
a musical tool, mainly because of the lack of screen reader
integration, or software, that conceptually focuses on graph-
ical elements. The diﬃculties of installing software on the
computer add up to this. Code-based music production of-
fers a more accessible approach, which, combined with the
zero-installation beneﬁt of web apps, could be a real so-
lution. But even though there are many web-based music
platforms, at the moment none are optimized for the use
with screen reader and Braille display. The development of
WELLE was a consequence of this situation and enabled
a group of blind and visually impaired pupils to use their
computers for the creation of music for the very ﬁrst time.
WELLE is a work in progress and not yet a stable mu-
sic environment for professional use, but oﬀers blind people
quick and uncomplicated access to musical drafts and play-
ful engagements with sounds through a textual interface.
The interface of WELLE will be further improved in consul-
tation with Martin Mayrhofer, a skilled and blind computer
technician, who also participated in the WELLE workshop
at the Austrian Computer Camp.
