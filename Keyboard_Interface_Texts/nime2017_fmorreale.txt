ABSTRACT
Every new edition of NIME brings dozens of new DMIs and
the feeling that only a few of them will eventually break
through. Previous work tried to address this issue with a
deductive approach by formulating design frameworks; we
addressed this issue with a inductive approach by elaborat-
ing on successes and failures of previous DMIs. We con-
tacted 97 DMI makers that presented a new instrument at
ﬁve successive editions of NIME (2010-2014); 70 answered.
They were asked to indicate the original motivation for de-
signing the DMI and to present information about its up-
take. Results conﬁrmed that most of the instruments have
diﬃculties establishing themselves. Also, they were asked
to reﬂect on the speciﬁc factors that facilitated and those
that hindered instrument longevity. By grounding these re-
ﬂections on existing reserach on NIME and HCI, we propose
a series of design considerations for future DMIs.

1. INTRODUCTION
In 2004 Jord` a memorably remarked that “many new instru-
ments are being invented. Too little striking music is being
made with them” [10]. Since then, an even more copious
number of instruments have been created, facilitated by in-
creasing interest in DMI research in academia and by the
crowdfunding revolution that has made production widely
accessible.1
Despite this, most DMIs still seem to have diﬃculties es-
tablishing themselves after their creation. Mamedes and
colleagues urged a self-criticism within the NIME commu-
nity: “A huge number of DMIs are presented every year and
few of them actually remain in use” [12]. Some musicians

have mastered new instruments through extended use (e.g.
Leatitia Sonami’s Lady Glove and Michel Waisvisz’s The
Hands), but it is common for new DMIs to be set aside
after only a few performances.
Acknowledging this limitation, throughout the years, sev-
eral design frameworks have been proposed to oﬀer musical
instrument designers a theoretical base by proposing design
heuristics [18, 20] and suggesting evaluation methods [8,
30]. In most of the cases, these frameworks were generated
with a top-down approach, which might lack empirical ob-
servations on the precise factors that facilitate or hinder the
establishment of an instrument.
Several of these factors lie outside the interest of our com-
munity (e.g. production models, advertisement, sponsor-
ship), but others are directly connected with our daily ex-
ercise. In particular, which speciﬁc design practices should
DMI makers follow to facilitate a prolonged use of the in-
strument? What are the most common design “mistakes”
that we make, which should better oﬀ brought to the fore?
This paper aims to provide a pragmatic answer to these
issues in an inductive way by directly questioning the design
practices of NIME members. We isolated the 97 papers
presented at ﬁve successive editions of NIME - from 2010
to 2014 - that introduced a new DMI2 (Section 2). We then
sent the main authors an online survey, which asked them
to indicate the original motivations and the ongoing use of
their DMI, and to reﬂect on the causes of its success or
lack of success. We received 70 answers, which we analysed
quantitavely and qualitatively.
With respect to the ongoing use of the DMIs, the answers
from the authors (Section 3) conﬁrmed that the percent-
age of DMIs that “broke through” (e.g. that have ongoing
projects, are regularly performed in public, and received
commercial interest) is quite low.
In terms of design practices, we identiﬁed a number of
factors that facilitate or hinder the uptake of an instrument
(Section 4) by integrating considerations from the authors
with typical HCI theory and practice. If some of the ﬁnd-
ings do not come as a surprise (e.g. a simple interaction
is advantageous), others oﬀer considerations that merit fur-
ther attention in our community. For instance, instrument
design should include “signature features” that are exclusive
to that DMI and support unique playing styles.
2. METHODOLOGY
2.1 Paper selection
We selected papers presented at ﬁve successive editions of
NIME, from 2010 to 2014. We did not include papers from
2With DMI we refer to all the new interfaces for musical
expression, not just the digital ones. We acknowledge that
some of the presented interfaces are not digital at all, but
we chose this acronym to disambiguate with that of the
conference.
192
the last two editions because of the infancy of the work:
rather than focusing on the spike of usage of a newly cre-
ated interface we were interested in legacy, which requires
maturity of a project.
We acknowledge that this selection fails to account for
the multiplicity of instruments and DMIs that were not pre-
sented at this conference - in particular, commercial DMIs
and those presented at the yearly Guthman musical instru-
ment competition3. However, the scientiﬁc rigour obliged
us to have a clear selection method, a demarcation line that
would be diﬃcult to trace with commercial DMIs. Further,
DMIs that were not presented at academic conferences lack
formal documentation that is needed to track their develop-
ment and draw formal comparisons among them. For this
reason, we also omitted the DMIs that were only presented
at the performance track of NIME, as they are not included
in conference proceedings. The works presented at other re-
lated conferences and journals falls out of the scope of this
paper but would make interesting future research.
Following the objective of this paper of determining what
design factors facilitate a long-term engagement with an in-
strument we restricted the investigation to the DMIs specif-
ically intended for solo human performer (as opposed to a
machine intelligence) to be able to play live in a concert-like
setting and that could potentially lead to prolonged use by
musicians and develop virtuosity.
We included: augmented instruments, software instru-
ments, controllers, mobile and tablet applications, systems
for performance, and sequencers. Everything else was ex-
cluded: audience-controlled instruments and installations,
algorithmic accompaniments, live coding and laptop orches-
tra, design probes, and instruments that target speciﬁc age
or medical conditions. In a few cases, the demarcation line
was not clear. In these cases, we adopted a relaxed pol-
icy and included the paper (e.g. we included three robotic
instruments conceived to be partially played by a human
performer). Using these criteria, 97 papers made the cut.
2.2 Questionnaire
An online questionnaire was prepared to provide answers to
our research questions 4. It included 27 entries that asked
about diﬀerent aspects that are relevant to the issues ad-
dressed in this paper. The questionnaires were sent via
email to the ﬁrst author of each paper. A total of 70 an-
swers were collected (72% response rate).
We acknowledge that the ﬁgures describing the DMIs up-
take reported in Section 3 fail to account for the 27 authors
that did not reply to our survey. However, the present in-
vestigation is mostly intended to measure the general tem-
perature of the DMIs presented at NIME rather than oﬀer-
ing meticulous statistics about their adoption. That being
said, the design consideration described in Section 4 would
have greatly beneﬁted from comments of the creators of the
DMIs that became popular even outside the academic com-
munity (e.g. the Roli Seaboard 5, the Magic Fiddle 6, and
the AlphaSphere7), and the discontinued ones alike.
2.3 Data analysis
The uptake of the DMIs (Section 3) was assessed by analysing
and comparing information about the author’s original mo-
tivations, their target users, the current state of the DMI,

To extract design considerations (Section 4) we integrated
creators’ reﬂections about the reasons for the longevity of
their instrument and aspects they would have done diﬀer-
ently with quantitative answers to some survey questions.
A thematic analysis with an inductive approach [3] was
performed on this data. Endorsing the idea that idiosyn-
cratic experiences with the design of a single DMI could
provide other makers with a crucial example, both as a sug-
gestion to follow enduring design decisions or to avoid re-
peating pitfalls, codes were associated to comments received
from a single author and to shared opinions.
The last step consisted in clustering codes into practical
design considerations. To this end, we examined the codes
taking into consideration design factors typical of NIME [10,
18, 29] and of the broader HCI community [4, 24].
3. INSTRUMENT UPTAKE
We retrospectively documented whether the original inten-
tions for building the instrument were met and we serached
for possible patterns of instrument uptake. This section
reports the results of this investigation.
3.1 Target user and original motivation
To start with, we asked the authors to indicate for whom
they made their DMI. Authors could choose as many an-
swers as they wish. The results indicate that the most com-
mon target user was the author themselves (Table 1).
Next, we asked the reasons that motivated the creation
of the DMI. Besides for documentary reasons, this informa-
tion was intended to restrict the scope of our investigations
to those works which were intentionally created (i) to be
actually performed with rather than being just research in-
vestigations; (ii) to be performed with on a long-term basis.
Authors were invited to pick as many motivations as they
wished from a list of seven entries; the results are presented
in Table 2. To cluster the answers into groups we per-
formed a principal component factor analysis with Varimax
rotation (Kaiser Normalisation). Three components with
an eigenvalue greater than 1.0 were found (the components
loading are shown in Table 2).
Component 1includes the DMIs designed as a research
investigation. Component 2 includes the DMIs designed
193
after the designer’s need. Component 3 suggests an in-
verse correlation between “To complement my artistic prac-
tice” and “As an assignment for school”. Given the focus
of this paper, we excluded from successive investigations
the 15 DMIs whose motivations only belonged to those of
Component 1 and those who were only intended “As an
assignment for school”.
Another question prompted the authors to indicate whether
their DMI was ever intended to be used on a long-term basis;
we excluded the 4 DMIs that were not. As a consequence of
these two exclusions, the report discussed in the next sec-
tions was reduced to the 51 DMIs that have been originally
designed for a prolonged use as a performance instrument.
3.2 Ongoing use
A number of questions directly investigated the ongoing use
of the instrument. Figure 1 indicates the percentage of
DMIs that are currently ready to performance; 47.1% are
not. Of these, two thirds would require substantial work
(more than a few hours) to be ready for performance.
Non ready 47.1%
Ready 52.9%
A few hours 31.5%
A few weeks  21.0%
More 21.0%
It no longer exists 15.7%
A few days 10.5%
Figure 1: Is the instrument ready for performance?
If not, how long would it take to have it ready for
performance?
Figure 2 indicates that the one third of the DMIs are
available to buy or to hire. Sale information oﬀers a similar
ﬁgure. Only one out of ﬁve DMIs sold at least 1 unit. A
notable diﬀerence exists between iOS apps and other DMIs.
The number of sales for iOS apps (including free downloads)
ranged from 1200 to 250000. If we exclude iOS apps, only
5 DMIs have ever been sold, 3 of which have been sold to
more than one buyer. It should be noted, however, that in
some cases the designers might have donated the DMI.
No 68.7%
To buy 17.6%
To hire 11.7%
To buy and to hire 3.9%
Figure 2: Is the instrument available to buy or hire?
Figure 3 shows that the 23.5% of the DMIs have been
publicly performed 0 or 1 times; more than half of them at
most 5 times. We then computed the average number of
performance for year, normalised by the edition of NIME
the paper was presented to. 8 On average, the 47.1% of the
DMIs have been publicly performed less than once for year
and only 11.8% have been performed more than 10 times
per year.
Figure 4 shows that almost half of the DMIs have been
played by fewer than 3 musicians; only one DMI out of ﬁve
has been played by at least 10 artists. Another indicator
of the uptake of a DMI is the number of ongoing projects
in which it is used. In more than half of the cases (53.1%)
there are no ongoing projects, though 10 authors indicated
that there might be some that they do not know about.
8This data is an estimate as some DMIs were available even
long before the paper presentation.

3.3 Interface evolution
Authors were asked to elaborate whether and how did their
initial intentions change; a third indicated they did.
In three cases, the target users changed. Two DMIs were
initially intended for the authors’ own composition but the
interest of others convinced them to make it available for
others. Conversely, one author was initially interested in
making a general instrument but he later redirected his ef-
forts to make an instrument for himself.
In six cases, the objective of the DMI changed. For in-
stance, the p-bROCK digital bagpipe [16] was originally
intended as instrument for performance and it is now about
to be commercialised as a tool for learning.
In a few other cases, the evolution that the DMI under-
went was caused by unexpected possibilities that emerged.
This is the case for the Magnetic Resonator Piano [14],
whose author reported that over time he discovered how
the original intended outcomes were less interesting or less
successful than he thought, but that some completely un-
expected new sounds and techniques emerged.
In some cases, the author attributed the importance of
the DMI presented at NIME as a formative event rather
than as the conclusion of a project. For instance, the Hex
Player [17] was only ever intended as a proof of princi-
ple: the intention of the author was to develop a better-
performing instrument at a later date, something that has
happened 5 years later. As another example, Dahlstedt re-
ported that he carries the experience of developing Pencil
Fields [5] with him; he uses what he has learnt from it into
future instruments and mappings all the time.
This reﬂections are supported by the answer to one ques-
tion that asked the reasons the authors attributed to the
limited uptake of their DMI, if applicable (for this speciﬁc

question we extended the investigation to all the 70 an-
swers). The answers are shown in Table 3. Of particular
interest is the record describing that many had turned their
attention to updated versions of the DMI or to other DMIs.
To this respect, we further asked if other DMIs derived from
the one presented at NIME. The 27.1% evolved into new
version; in other cases it inspired other instruments built
by the same author (8.5%) or by others (7.1%).
The ﬁgures presented in this section oﬀer a picture of the
uptake of the DMIs presented at NIME conﬁrming what has
been recognised by members of our community [10, 12] but
never systematically pinpointed. Most of the DMIs that
were originally intended to be performed on a long-term
basis ended up being performed for a few exhibitions only.
4. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
This section proposes reﬂections about practices and pro-
cesses of instrument design. Makers’ diagnoses of design
issues that limited the uptake of the instruments are inte-
grated with considerations about their ample uptake. When
applicable, these reﬂections are grounded on theories and
practices typical of HCI.
4.1 Signature Features
An important element that seems to determine to a relevant
extent the positive uptake of a DMI is the idiosyncratic
attributes that it oﬀers - what [19] deﬁned as “signature
features” and [20] called “unique identity.” These attributes
can either refer to the functionality or to the appearance of
the DMI.
4.1.1 Functional
Three authors reﬂected that their DMI oﬀered features that
are completely new, that go beyond what was achievable
before, that help achieving a particular goal in the authors’
artistic practice, or that fulﬁl a speciﬁc need. For instance,
the speciﬁc need fulﬁled by the Quarterstaﬀ [22], was “to
perform electronic sounds in a gestural way” .
The uniqueness of the DMI was attributed by three au-
thors to the idiosyncratic sound their DMI produces. An
example is oﬀered by McPherson when comparing his two
augmented instruments: as opposed to the Magnetic Res-
onator Piano [14], which “has a distinct sound world of its
own, which has given composers a reason to use it” , the
TouchKeys [13]“is a MIDI controller, it lacks its own sound.
I have found the lack of a signature sound to be an impedi-
ment to its artistic uptake, especially among composers” .
4.1.2 Aesthetic and craftsmanship
Five authors attributed the popularity of their DMI to its
unique aesthetic: its look, its feel, its craftsmanship and
woodworking, and its quality construction. Answering on
what aspects of their DMIs they would improve, two cre-
ators indicated aesthetics, ergonomic, and build quality.
An idiosyncratic appearance also enables the DMI to stick
out during a live performance. When discussing the positive
aspects of his Manta [26], Snyder commented that “it has
a unique look and feel that sets it aside on stage” . Similar
comments were given about the E-Recorder [9]: “it is nice
to watch on stage”, and The Talking Guitar [7]: “it requires
large gestures which are easy to interpret for the audience” .
4.2 User-experience
User-experience design is one of the most common design
processes in HCI. Its appropriateness for DMIs was ad-
vocated by Morreale and colleagues in their experience-
oriented design framework [18]. Comments collected from
the authors supported the centrality of musician experience
in the design process of a DMI: seven DMIs achieved their
positive uptake by addressing aspects of user-experience.
4.2.1 Familiarity
Three authors attributed the positive uptake of their DMI
to having oﬀered an intuitive instrument based on tradi-
tional modes of interaction. This is the case, for instance,
of the TouchKeys [13], whose “success is directly tied to its
familiarity” and of the Concept Tahoe [23], a microphone
augmented with buttons to MIDI control that “worked be-
cause it took a form factor that people were familiar with,
and expanded upon it”. The instrument did not invent com-
pletely new musical possibilities, but it “made it easier or
more elegant - people were already creating live-looped per-
formances”.
4.2.2 Simplicity of interaction
Having a simple interaction favoured the uptake of three
DMIs. For instance, the isomorphic design of Musix [21]
“enabled everybody to interact with tonal music in an alter-
native way to traditional piano layout, exposing and sim-
plifying harmony”. As another example, the Pencil Fields
[5] “allowed for embodied playing on an instrument which is
otherwise hard to control in that way” .
4.2.3 Set-up time
A long preparation time might hinder the will of the musi-
cian to pick up the DMI. Leeuw brought this issue to the
fore when reﬂecting on his Electrumpet [11]: “it is not ready
out of the box like my normal trumpet is” .
4.3 Technology
This section oﬀers discussions about authors’ fortunate and
erroneous choice of hardware and software.
4.3.1 Common platforms
Both developers of mobile apps and designers of tangible
DMIs suggested to choose commonly available platforms.
The former agreed unanimously that iOS is preferable to
other platforms as it oﬀers a solid user base that is recep-
tive to new instruments. The latter suggested to design
for commonly available devices rather than creating new
hardware or using less commonly available hardware. This
suggestion extended to using more typical audio platforms
- as Axoloti9, Bela10 [15], or Teensy11.
The platform should also be easy to keep up to date and
ready to perform. Snyder suggested that he would possibly
“make a bootloader to allow the user to upgrade the ﬁrmware
9http://www.axoloti.com
10http://www.bela.io
11https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/
195
remotely” for the Snyderphonics Manta [26]. This concern
was shared by the 41.2% of the authors: their ability to set
up and run the system is currently tied to an old version
of speciﬁc software that does not reliably run any longer.
To have the instrument ready for performance they should
upgrade (32.4%) or even downgrade (8.8%) the OS or other
software.
4.3.2 Open-source
With the exception of those operating in the mobile domain,
a general consensus endorsed the use of open-source soft-
ware and hardware platforms. Donnarumma, for instance,
attributed part the popularity (more than 1200 units sold)
of the XTH Sense [6] to being open-source.
Four other authors, when reﬂecting of what they would
have done diﬀerently, indicated that they would choose open-
source solutions. Sent ¨urk elaborated that his Kinect-based
interface [25] would have been more enduring if it had been
open-source: “it is more sustainable, it allows derivatives
and oﬀers inspiration to proliferate” . A similar argument
was made for the Snyderphonics Manta [26]: avoiding vendor-
speciﬁc HID protocol would free the creator to continue to
support translation software for it.
4.3.3 Portability and low latency
The comments of seven authors supported previous research
ﬁndings that portability and low latency are important fea-
tures for the uptake of audio applications [19]. While the
importance of low latency was explicitly mentioned by one
author only, six authors elaborated on the need for self-
containedness, which makes an instrument always ready to
use and play without the need to connect it to a computer.
Van der Torren explicitly indicated self-containedness as
“the main reason for the success of Striso” [28]. Snyder
reported that future implementations of the Birl [27] will
be self-contained so that it won’t “need to interface with a
multimedia computer (which will inevitably change and be
updated down the road)”. Similarly, Gabana suggested that
he would modify his Radear [1] to make it self-contained.
4.3.4 Modularity
Five authors pointed out the importance of having a modu-
lar structure in hardware, software, and coding procedures.
This would allow the DMI to be more easily ﬁxed, updated,
and expanded. The modularity argument was brought up
also for what concerns the very category of DMI: when re-
ﬂecting on the limited uptake of his augmented keyboard
[31], Wierenga reported that he “moved away from working
with a single virtuoso instrument and toward a multiplicity
of smaller modular instruments” .
4.4 Musical possibilities
Four authors reﬂected on the musical possibilites oﬀered, or
not yet oﬀered, by their DMI.
4.4.1 Ownership
DMI frameworks exist that suggest that the execution and
the identiﬁcation of unique playing styles should be sup-
ported in instrument design by means of personalisation [18,
29]. This concept was elaborated by Snyder when talking
about the Birl [27]: “The ability for a performer to train
the instrument to his or her own control mapping prefer-
ences (such as ﬁngerings for certain pitches) was particu-
larly useful for musicians playing the Birl” .
4.4.2 Subtle control
Two authors identiﬁed the lack of subtle control in their
DMI as the cause of its limited uptake. Even in cases of
ample uptake, a subtler control would entail deeper sound
manipulation, which, as reported by Grossman, was not
possible when the E-Recorder [9] was created in 2000 but it
would be now feasible.
4.5 Design process
Comments from eleven authors referred to design decisions
that were taken, or not taken. In this section we grounded
these reﬂections on design concepts typical of HCI.
4.5.1 Scenario development
Related work on HCI [2, 4] and NIME [18] suggests to start
the design process from scenarios identiﬁcation and high-
level user stories development. This excercise helps design-
ers to “clarify implicit assumptions, raise design questions,
suggest design solutions” [2], and to “to reﬂect upon the
kind of experience they wish to oﬀer” [18].
Collected comments evidenced a general lack of care in
the development of design scenarios. Two authors attributed
the lack of uptake of their DMI to not having properly elab-
orated scenarios for performing with their instrument. In
the case of The Talking Guitar [7], for instance, Donovan
acknowledged not having suﬃciently considered “the prac-
ticalities of performing with the instrument, in particular
about the constraints imposed by the tech” .
4.5.2 Participatory design
Participatory design is an approach to design that involves
the users destined to use the system to play a critical role
in designing it [24]. Working with ﬁnal users at early stages
of design promotes their skills and experiences as a resource
for design.
Six creators endorsed the advantages of working with the
ﬁnal user at early stages of design. Working with ﬁnal users
is particularly important when working with less familiar
instrument paradigms, as elaborated by Snyder when dis-
cussing the design process for the Birl [27]: “I am not a
wind player, I needed to gather more feedback about the er-
gonomics of the instrument, and the needs of players” .
Empowering users to have a say in the design process
also helps identifying possible pitfalls, as in the case of the
Gamelan Sampul [32]. The gamelan musicians that worked
with the author turned down the proposed solution as they
mistrusted technology: they feared electronic musical in-
struments would take over the classical gamelan world.
4.5.3 Prototyping
A possible limit of participatory design is expressed by Sny-
der, who involved users in the design of the Birl [27]:“many
things that players said they wouldn’t like wound up being
things they liked once I had implemented them and they
were able to try them out. So I’m not sure how much
stock I should give this feedback until I have testable proto-
types”. This statement highlights the importance of proto-
types when designing new DMIs, as seconded by Mamedes
when describing how diﬀerently would he develop his In-
tonaspacio [12]: “I would try to have several iterations of
the prototype and have more people to try it out (analysis
gestures) before creating a ﬁnal performance version.”
4.5.4 Market Analysis
Market analysis oﬀers another way to sense what the user
response could be. One author reported that a well-known
company operating in music technology may pick the DMI
back up again, “but in the meantime they are attempting
to ﬁnd evidence that the market is big enough to be worth
further investment”.

5. FINAL REMARKS
This paper provided evidence to the prevalent feeling that
most DMIs fail at the longevity exam [10, 12]. This paper
addressed this issue by proposing a bottom-up approach
that generated insights to assist creators’ design by learning
from good practices and mistakes of past DMIs.
Our contribution should not be intended as another DMI
design framework, neither as a receipe book to meticulously
follow when designing new musical instruments. Rather, it
should be intended as a repository of DMI creators’ reﬂec-
tions on their own practice, which we elaborated into prac-
tical design considerations. These considerations highlight
factors that future designers can use to make their designs
more enduring, and pitfalls they can avoid.
Findings presented in this paper also suggest that some
of the DMIs are indeed discontinued in their original ver-
sion but, nevertheless, they contributed by informing future
work. In any new enterprise many new products fail but are
inspirational; in academia, research papers rarely represent
the ﬁnal word on a subject; in contemporary composition,
many pieces are not played more than once or twice. In
each case it is an expected and normal outcome that most
creations do not have staying power.
This reﬂection opens a debate: is non-continuation nec-
essarily a sign of failure of DMIs? What should the com-
munity’s expectations be for instruments to continue to be
used? We believe that our responsibility as the main aca-
demic hub of DMI design is to pick up these challenges and
establish NIME as the home of this debate.
