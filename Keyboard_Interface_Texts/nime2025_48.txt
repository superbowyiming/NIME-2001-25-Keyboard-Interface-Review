Abstract
Vocalization and visualization are recognized as two powerful
methods for internalizing music that are effective with beginner
and skilled musicians alike. Despite the well-researched bene-
fits of each practice, integrated visualization of vocalizations
for instrument learning has seen little attention in the music
technology community. This paper introduces the design and
implementation of ViVo, a piano learning tool that connects the
embodied sense of pitch offered by vocalization with the spa-
tial intuition provided by in situ visualization. ViVo offers two
modes: a real-time mode that hears live user vocalizations to con-
currently illuminate the corresponding piano keys, and a practice
mode that visualizes recorded vocalizations for repeated prac-
tice. By providing an integrated system to foster and visualize
vocalizations, ViVo aims to leverage the noted benefits of both
practices to make learning piano more effective, intuitive, and
engaging.

1 Introduction
Vocalization, the practice of using the voice to render pitches,
melodies, and rhythms out loud, has been found to be a powerful
mechanism for internalizing music that holds great benefit for
learning musical instruments. Prominent music pedagogies such
as Dalcroze, Gordon, Kodály, Orff, and Suzuki [7, 8, 10, 11, 15], as
well as many skilled musicians, employ vocalization as a crucial
step in developing the intuitive sense of music that is founda-
tional for instrument mastery, and additionally as an effective
technique for building improvisation and composition skills. Ev-
idence suggests that vocalization does improve many aspects
of musicianship: it has been shown to improve beginning musi-
cians’ sense of pitch and melody [5]; vocal melodies are better
remembered than instrumental melodies by both musicians and
non-musicians [16]; and vocalization has been found to be an
important tool in facilitating self-guided music learning, which
is crucial for improvement outside of structured classroom and
lesson contexts [2].
However, despite extensive evidence that vocalization is highly
effective for learning music, it is not regularly utilized in practice.
Many high school and college band directors, while understand-
ing the value of vocalization, do not use it in their instruction
[1]; the same tendency has also been found among elementary
school teachers [13].
Similarly, vocalization as a tool specifically for learning musi-
cal instruments has seen little attention in the music technology

community—while vocalization has a well-established presence
at NIME, a taxonomy of research involving voice at NIME [12]
points to its use primarily as a control mechanism for a range of
interactions or as the focus of explorations into voice itself, rather
than as a mechanism for understanding another instrument.
Learning tools based on visualization, in contrast, have been
well-explored in music technology. Existing piano systems in-
clude ones which provide real-time instruction and feedback on
improvisation, composition, and general music understanding.
They use a variety of approaches including light strips mounted
above a piano keyboard [3], projected animations [17], rendered
virtual models [14], and augmented reality (AR) overlays [4, 9].
But despite the prevalence of visualization as an instrument
learning tool, visualizing vocalization expressly for learning a
musical instrument has seen little attention.
ViVo is designed to enable the real-time visualization of vo-
calization dedicated to learning piano. It integrates these two
methods of intuitive musical understanding by associating the
embodied sense of pitch offered by vocalization with the spatial
intuition provided by in situ visualization. By providing an inte-
grated system to visualize vocalizations, ViVo aims to leverage
the noted benefits of both practices to make learning piano more
effective, intuitive, and engaging.
2 Design
ViVo is envisioned to be a tool that can be easily incorporated into
music instrument practices. It consists of three main components:
a microphone input and a central processor housed together in
an enclosure, and an electronic piano keyboard with embedded
key lights (Figure 2). The interface is intentionally simple to
allow for easy activation of the mic during instruction in order
to encourage vocalization, and for quick capture of impromptu
arrangements to support improvisation.

2.1 Modes of Operation
The system has two modes of operation: Real-time mode and
Practice mode.
The default state is Real-time mode, where user vocalizations
are processed from the live microphone input. Note onsets and
pitches (i.e. fundamental frequencies 𝑓0 of notes) are extracted
from the input audio, and corresponding pitches on the keyboard
are illuminated in real-time. The pitches extracted from the input
can optionally also be simultaneously played by sending modified
MIDI messages to the keyboard.
Practice mode is activated either by pressing the Record button
to record a vocalization, or by pressing the Playback button to
play back the recording on-demand with associated pitches con-
currently illuminated and sounded using extracted note onset and
pitch information. The system reverts back to Real-time mode
when not recording or when a playback recording concludes.
2.2 Goals
ViVo’s main use case as a device employed during instrument
practice imposes several system-level constraints: portability, a
reasonably low materials cost, and sufficiently real-time opera-
tion for a seamless interactive experience.
For performance metrics, three key characteristics were iden-
tified as important goals for high-quality visualization: pitch
accuracy, pitch range, and note onset/offset fidelity.
2.3 Hardware
ViVo’s system is built around the Teensy 4.1, a low-cost micro-
controller that offers real-time audio processing capabilities in a
small form factor. Including the microphone, custom PCB, enclo-
sure, and all other components (excluding the MIDI keyboard),
the entire system can be built for under $100 USD. All code and
design files are open-source and publicly available.1
2.4 Algorithms
ViVo is constructed with two candidate pitch detection algo-
rithms to extract pitch from vocalizations: YIN [5] and a heuristics-
based approach using an 1024 point FFT with parabola fitting.
Although using parabolic and Gaussian interpolation to more
accurately identify the most prominent pitch in an FFT frequency
spectrum has been well-explored [ 6], ViVo introduces several

and C#5
modifications specialized for singing 𝑓0 detection: ViVo first iden-
tifies the bins that correspond to the pitch range of most vocal-
izations by novice musicians (approximately 100–1000 Hz) and
computes the average energy𝜇𝐸 across that range; then, the algo-
rithm traverses the bins from low to high and identifies the first
three consecutive bins with energy greater than 𝜇𝐸, performs a
three-point parabola fit, and returns the vertex of the parabola as
the detected 𝑓0, optionally smoothed by an IIR lowpass filter. This
method makes the system more robust to environmental noise,
and avoids the common error mode of being off by an octave that
results from the first harmonic sometimes having more energy
than the fundamental.
3 Evaluation
ViVo was evaluated against the three stated goals of pitch ac-
curacy, range and note onset/offset detection. For consistency
and repeatability, ViVo was tested using the Spitfire Audio Folk
Voices library played through a speaker placed 70 cm away at
normal talking volumes, to simulate common usage conditions.
3.1 Pitch Detection
Both pitch detection approaches had approximately equal laten-
cies (less than 30ms) and memory footprints. The YIN and FFT
results both compared well with the CREPE algorithm (Figure
3) which was run on the test file directly using a MacBook. The
YIN algorithm was more accurate than the 1024 point FFT by 1-2
Hz. Similar to previous findings on gains from parabola fitting

[7], ViVo’s FFT parabola fitting algorithm experienced a 10-20x
improvement in resolution compared with the raw bin size of
43Hz. While the YIN algorithms performed slightly better than
the FFT-based approach, the FFT may be attractive in other ap-
plications, especially in compute-restricted environments where
it is already being computed for visualization or other feature
extraction purposes.
Although both tested pitch detection methods perform well for
monophonic vocalization, variation in extracted pitch, resulting
from users themselves singing inexact or inconsistent pitches, is
unavoidable. Many singers “bend into” notes by starting at an
arbitrarily lower pitch and transitioning up into their intended
pitch (Figure 4), which creates a period of pitch uncertainty at the
onset of each note that may span several hundred milliseconds.
This can be reduced by instructing users to begin notes with a
consonant (e.g. “doo” or “bah”), but is still significant, especially
with novice singers.
3.2 Range
The YIN, FFT and CREPE algorithms were tested from E3 (165Hz)
to C5 (523Hz), and all three algorithms were able to span the full
range with similar results to Figure 3 for each note. Of the three
algorithms, the FFT was slightly less robust as it occasionally
could not detect the specific combination of low pitches (E3 to
G3) at low volume. The root cause appeared to be issues with the
parabola fitting only receiving 2 accurate data points from the
FFT, instead of the 3 points needed.
3.3 Note Onset/ Offset
Note onsets and offsets were detected by recognizing when the
RMS signal power exceeds a relative threshold after first applying
a bandpass filter of 100 to 1000 Hz. Using this approach, ViVo
had a signal to noise ranging from 30 to 40 dB during testing.
4 Future Work
In future work, ViVo’s pitch detection system will be extended
to support simple polyphonic input, which would enable visu-
alization of inputs beyond user vocalization to include content
such as recorded music or online music lesson videos.
Further development would also include implementing ViVo
in a larger music education or classroom context to evaluate
how it could help build musical intuition and support self-guided
practice at scale. Another potential user study would investigate
ViVo’s effect on the development of improvisation skills in jazz
pianists by assessing the degree to which the repeated practice
of vocalizing improvised musical phrases integrated with ViVo’s
spatial visualizations of corresponding pitches improves their
learning process.
More broadly, ViVo’s integrated visualization of vocalization
could be employed to build musical intuition in students learning
a variety of new instruments. While the current prototype uses a
piano keyboard, future iterations of ViVo could be implemented
on other target instruments like guitar (e.g. through a lighted
fretboard), or even offer an intuitive route to learn novel musical
interfaces that have uncommon pitch layouts (such as for first-
time users of the Linnstrument, which has both MIDI-controlled
lighted keys and a layout unfamiliar to most musicians).
While developed primarily as an instrument learning tool,
ViVo also opens novel live performance opportunities by pre-
senting a new mode of musical interaction that utilizes voice to
engage with and actuate a range of digital systems. This real-time
vocal agency afforded by ViVo offers possibilities for applications
in live stage productions, collaborative and interactive creative
works, and improvisational music performances.
