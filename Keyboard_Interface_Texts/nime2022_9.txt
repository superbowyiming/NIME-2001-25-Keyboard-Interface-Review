ABSTRACT
Digital musical instruments (DMIs) built to be used in performance settings need to go 
beyond the prototypical stage of design to become robust, reliable, and responsive 
devices for extensive usage. This paper presents the Tapbox and the Slapbox, two 
generations of a standalone DMI built for percussion practice. After summarizing the 
requirements for performance DMIs from previous surveys, we introduce the Tapbox 
and comment on its strong and weak points. We then focus on the design process of 
the Slapbox, an improved version that captures a broader range of percussive 
gestures. Design tasks are reflected upon, including enclosure design, sensor 
evaluations, gesture extraction algorithms, and sound synthesis methods and 
mappings. Practical exploration of the Slapbox by two professional percussionists is 
performed and their insights summarized, providing directions for future work.

Introduction
Designing a digital musical instrument (DMI) [1] for musical performance involves 
creating a responsive, robust device that gives the performer confidence in their 
interactions. While vital for commercially made instruments, these properties are often 
overlooked in research-borne DMIs. Though this can be attributed to a number of 
factors including project scope and time constraints, it leaves many instruments 
unable to be maintained or played reliably after construction [2].
Bearing these goals in mind, this project explores the development of the Slapbox: a 
low-latency, robust DMI for percussionists that can be engaging and reliable for a 
performer to use. This project builds up from previous research into designing 
standalone DMIs for performance that are viable for long-term practice [3].
The choice to iterate on an existing instrument was a key part of the instrument’s 
development. The process of iteration in design can be modeled as a continuous

pattern reflecting the current understanding of the design problem [4]. In addition to 
the initial formulation, using iteration throughout the design process facilitates the 
recognition of drawbacks that may be improved upon in future developments [5][6].
For instance, to avoid the development time often spent on enclosure design and 
electronics choices, the Slapbox utilizes the work completed on an existing instrument 
towards this goal: the Tapbox [7]. Both instruments provide control surfaces and audio 
output in the same enclosure, letting users pick up and play them with minimal setup, 
though they differ in key design features such as the materials used in the interaction 
surfaces and sensor design to capture percussion gestures.
In order to understand the limitations and opportunities for iteration from the original 
Tapbox, its design and framework are first reviewed. Interaction and synthesis goals 
for the Slapbox are then examined, forming a procedure for sensor evaluation and 
gesture extraction. Several sound synthesis methods and mappings are explored to 
utilize the new interaction opportunities offered by the design, using informal 
evaluations performed by two professional percussionists to discuss the instrument’s 
success in its design goals. In addition to detailing the technical development of a new 
digital instrument, this paper aims to provide insights gained from the iterative 
process regarding sensor configurations, signal processing efficiency and design 
segmentation.
Background
Percussive gestural controllers and instruments afford an impressive variety of 
interaction types and sounds. Commercial digital percussion controllers most 
commonly take the form of velocity sensitive MIDI drum pads1,2,3 that utilize finger 
drumming techniques to trigger musical events in an external program. Devices to 
augment existing acoustic percussion instruments have been created that utilize 
known interaction surfaces [8][9][10] including commercial products such as Sensory 
Percussion Sensors4. The acoustic properties of percussive interactions have been 
used to classify gestures [11] or enhance the sonic properties of the interactions [12], 
seen commercially in the Korg Wavedrum5. Other instruments have been created using 
specific synthesis goals to design the physical interface [13].
A standard paradigm for musical interaction proposed by Claude Cadoz specifies three 
categories of gestures: excitation, selection and modulation [14]. Excitation gestures 
directly produce a sound as in striking a drum, while modulation changes a sonic 
property or parameter of the instrument. Selection gestures are used to select a

component from an instrument, such as selecting a drum pad to hit from one of the 
pad controllers mentioned above. Modulation gestures are significantly less common 
with percussion instruments, which was considered when planning the redesigned 
instrument.
The Slapbox and its predecessor, the Tapbox, are designed as standalone digital 
instruments with embedded sound synthesis to be played using hands/fingers, either 
placed on a stand or as a portable instrument. The instrument design aims to imitate 
the finger drumming capabilities provided by velocity pad controllers for gestural 
input. The Slapbox aims to give users the ability to fuse excitation and modulation 
gestures in percussive performances by serving both types of gestures on the same 
control surface.
Revisiting the Tapbox
The Tapbox was one of three instruments developed in parallel, and belongs to a family 
of instruments called Noiseboxes. The objective of the original Noisebox was to 
incorporate some of the essential elements of conventional instruments into a 
standalone device that could afford new and different ways of performing [15]. In 
particular, qualities of instant playability (pick it up and start playing), tightly coupled 
input to sound mapping, direct sound output, and wires-free operation were 
prioritized. Several versions of the original Noisebox were constructed, all maintaining 
the same basic input controls (primarily buttons, linear FSRs and IMU-based motion 
sensing) and sound output (FM synthesis-based polyphonic drones).
Physical Design
The interaction style of the Tapbox was inspired by the cajón, a box shaped percussion 
instrument played with the hands. In particular, two qualities were highly appealing. 
First, there are no ‘external’ controls, meaning that the walls of the box itself are the 
input controls. Second, a skilled player can elicit a variety of sounds from the different 
surfaces of the cajón, based on both the construction (with snares and other 
treatments applied to the inside of the instrument) and playing techniques.
For the Tapbox (pictured in Figure 1), one surface was reserved for necessary auxiliary 
controls and connection points, while the remaining five sides functioned as input 
devices that could be mapped to different sounds. To detect strikes from the player, a 
large piezoelectric element was attached to the underside of each acrylic side panel, 
while rubber bushings isolated the panels from the 3D printed frame. Orientation

sensing was also added to the Tapbox which could modulate the sound in different 
ways.
Sound Synthesis and Modulation
Two synthesis modes were developed for the Tapbox. The first was a conventional 
drum kit based on the voices of the classic Roland TR-808 and built using a variety of 
subtractive and FM synthesis techniques. This mode was intended for the instrument 
to serve in a fairly typical percussive fashion, that could share some similarity to the 
cajón. The second mode was a versatile physical model based on resonant cylinder that 
could deliver a variety of sounds, from percussive bell-like tones to complex, multi-
timbral drones. The purpose of this mode was to feature novel synthesized sounds that 
could be controlled using familiar gestures.

A unique feature of the instrument was the method of selecting and interpolating 
between the two synthesis modes which leveraged the Tapbox’s IMU-based orientation 
sensing capability. When the instrument was positioned normally (as shown in Figure 
1), the drum synthesis mode would be active. Rotated 180° into an upside down 
orientation, the resonant cylinder synthesis mode would be active, and rotating the box 
somewhere in the middle (between 75° and 115°) would interpolate between the two 
modes. Additional modulation parameters for both synthesis modes were mapped to 
the other rotational axes so that the instrument could produce a wide variety of 
percussive and non-percussive sounds depending on its position and movement.
Limitations and Possible Improvements
The Tapbox was preliminarily completed, yet it suffered from issues that precluded it 
from being viable for performance. In particular, two main areas were identified for 
further development, which ultimately led to the new Slapbox instrument.
First, despite successful initial tests, we were disappointed with the performance of 
the chosen sensor design. While the piezoelectric panel sensors performed well in 
testing, there were significant limitations with respect to the desired interaction styles. 
Amplitude sensitivity was poor, and the design didn’t allow for continuous control 
signals or positional sensing.
Second, physical interactions were similar in all panels, given the use of the same 
materials and sensors in all five sides, preventing exploration of other types of physical 
interactions with the instrument.
To determine the work needed for an improved design, the Tapbox was evaluated in 
terms of its enclosure and interaction surfaces to search for re-usable components in 
the device. To retain the standalone functionality of the original design, the front 
panel’s speakers and auxiliary control inputs were preserved. Much of the Tapbox’s 
internal electronics including the microcontroller, audio and power circuits are re-
used, with both designs operating on the Bela6 platform which enables low-latency 
audio and sensor acquisition.
Slapbox Development
Interaction Methods
The Slapbox is a percussive instrument that offers several interaction surfaces to be 
tapped, brushed, and slapped. Interactions give users real-time control over

modulation effects using the same drumming surfaces, aiming to further explore the 
uses of modulation gestures in percussive performances.
Panel Layouts
The box’s top panel contains two large position sensing pads and two buttons that 
change the playback speed of the audio. To provide visual feedback to the user, LED’s 
are positioned around the top panel and light up when the corresponding pad is struck 
or held. Each side panel functions similarly to the position sensing pads on the top 
panel, detecting strike position relative to the side’s center. A ridged guiro-inspired 
component lies in the middle of the back panel to enable rhythmic sliding gestures 
with small pressure pads on either side of it. Velocity, pressure and position are 
tracked by all components except for the pads on either side of the guiro, which track 
only velocity and pressure. Each panel is covered with a 1mm layer of cork, which 
provides a smooth tactile feeling without affecting the accuracy of sensor readings. 
The completed assembly can be seen from both sides in Figure 2.
Sensor Evaluations
Capturing the position, continuous pressure and velocity of percussive gestures 
requires transducers that can sense extremely quick body movements. Although there 
exists many sensors that are capable of extracting percussive gestures [16], the design 
goals and constraints of this project eliminates several options from consideration.
The use of rigid acrylic panels as interaction surfaces instead of flexible membranes 
rules out reflective optical sensors as candidates, which have been used to accurately

detect strike positions [17]. As our design intends to be played with the user’s hands, 
approaches that typically track stick motion such as cameras, electromagnetic sensors 
and accelerometers do not apply. Fiberoptic sensors have been used to sense 
multitouch pressure [18], but their lack of commercial availability and shape variations 
would impede the instrument’s reproducibility. Microphones and piezoelectric sensors 
are able to extract and classify percussive excitation gestures as seen in [11] and [7] 
respectively, but fail to capture the continuous pressure of modulation gestures. 
Additionally, trials with the panel-mounted piezoelectric sensors on the Tapbox 
resulted in leakage peaks when striking the frame or adjacent panels, and mounting 
the sensor between an additional acrylic layer also dampened its signal leading to 
unreliable velocity estimation. 
This leaves us with force sensitive resistors (FSRs), which are able to sense continuous 
pressure and come in a variety of shapes, sizes and sensitivities. A number of 
configurations were considered, including standalone FSRs from commercial sources7 
and homemade sensors built from resistive materials that can be configured to detect 
pressure [19].
Though both commercial and homemade FSRs are able to track pressure, the shape 
restrictions of commercial models do not allow for the position sensing capabilities 
afforded by homemade sensors. Pressure resistive materials like Velostat8 can be 
configured to detect continuous position by arranging patterns of conductors above 
and below the material. Compared to other pressure resistive materials seen in [19], 
Velostat’s consistency and robustness led to its use for the Slapbox’s sensors. It should 
be noted that a combination of different sensing types can be used to reinforce the 
accuracy and consistency of extracted gestures as seen in [20], and these methods 
may be applied to future iterations of the Slapbox. The comparison of capabilities for 
commonly used percussive sensors can be seen in Table 1.

Sensor Design
Velostat can be configured to detect taps using either of the circuits shown in  Figure 
3. Drum pads for the top and side panels are created with the sandwich circuit option 
by placing rings of copper tape concentrically around each other (shown in Figure 4), 
configuring each ring as a voltage divider with Velostat as the variable resistor. The 
concentric configuration was chosen to track tap position relative to the center of the 
pad, imitating the behavior of a circular drum head. The top pads contain five rings 
each while the side pads only had room for three, resulting in slightly less resolution in 
the side panel’s position estimations. Slots are laser cut into the panels to pass the top 
and bottom conductors through to the inside of the box for connection. The sensing 
range for the drum pads were increased by adding an additional layer of Velostat to 
each pad. This modification resulted in more accurate velocity estimations and added 
room for lighter impulses to be detected.
One important drawback to the concentric ring pads is their ability to detect multiple 
contact points on the same surface. While this configuration achieves concentric 
position sensing using only a few sensing inputs to the microcontroller, each ring is 
only able to detect one interaction at a time. This limits the types of detectable finger 
drumming techniques, and could be improved in a later iteration by using a different 
(and more dense) conductor configuration.

Variance in surface area in the conductive strips was found to lead to uneven steady-
state values for each ring due to larger conductive areas allowing more charge 
through the resistive material. This inconsistency requires normalization to detect the 
centroid accurately by distributing the signal values linearly between their minimum 
resting values and a common maximum shared by all pads, which is an available 
function in the graphical user interface presented later on.
Both the guiro and its neighboring small pads were tested using Figure 3’s gap circuit, 
but experiments showed that this configuration was only accurate when pressing 
directly in the middle of the gap. Using the sandwich circuit for all components on the 
back panel (seen in Figure 5) resulted in usable signals, but required too much force to 
detect natural brushes across the ridges. In a later iteration of the back panel, the 
guiro was replaced with 3D printed ridges of conductive PLA material9 (seen in Figure 
2). 3D printed conductive materials have many uses for creating custom resistive and 
capacitive sensors [21]. By connecting the conductive ridges to a Trill Craft capacitive 
touch sensing board10, the ridges are able to detect touch interactions from user. 
Capacitive sensing for the guiro proved much more reliable than the Velostat 
configuration, but limits guiro interactions to fingers or another conductive material. 
As the Slapbox is primarily designed for finger and hand interactions, this is an 
acceptable limitation.
The back panel’s side pads were also iterated upon, using 3D printed conductive layers 
of PLA instead of copper tape to make the contact to the Velostat more consistent. 
Wires could be attached to the PLA for the side pads and guiro components cleanly on 
the other side of the panel by heating up the tips of male jumper wires with a soldering 
iron while pressing them into the material.

Gesture Extraction
Position calculation
The values for each ring can be compared to find the most likely position of the source 
of pressure being applied to a pad, and can also be used for analyzing continuous 
pressure changes. As pads are comprised of multiple rings each with their own 
pressure values, the centroid is first determined to estimate where the pressure source 
lies relative to the pad’s center. A larger number of rings in a pad results in a finer 
resolution of this calculation, yet only three rings as in the side pads produced 
accurate estimations. Ring thickness and distance between rings must also be 
considered, though the centroid calculation assumes equidistant rings with equal 
widths. For the array of ring values x, the floating point index of the centroid is 
calculated with: 
Figure 5

where:
n = the number of strips, and
m = the sum of values
Pressure estimation
A pad’s centroid index represents the floating point representation of the center of 
mass of the ring pressure array, indicating the relative position to the pad’s center 
while pressure is applied. Once the index is calculated, a pad’s pressure value is found 
by linearly interpolating between the ring array values around the centroid index. The 
centroid was found to be mostly noise until pressure was applied to the pad, so is only 
considered valid when the pad’s overall pressure value exceeds roughly  of its 
maximum value.
Impulse detection
Detecting pad strikes, seen as impulses in pressure values, is done by calculating the 
rate of change of pressure over time. If the pad’s pressure and its rate of change 
exceed a threshold, an impulse is detected using a state machine. The impulse 
threshold determines the sensitivity of the instrument, and it is important to find a 
value that detects light impulses without resulting in false triggers. This pressure 
value at the time of an impulse being detected corresponds to the impulse’s velocity.
The guiro component is able to use this algorithm by detecting swipes across its ridges 
as sequential impulses. The swipes generate considerably less force than taps on the 
pads though, so the threshold to trigger impulses is lowered for its sensor 
configuration.
Sound Synthesis
Using the Slapbox’s sensor input from each surface, a simple mapping was designed to 
trigger percussion sounds using audio sampling. Using the gesture extraction 
algorithms above, the position relative to a pad’s center and velocity value can be 
extracted from each tap on any of the four full sensing pads and mapped to synthesis 
parameters.

When tapped, the pads trigger an audio sample of either a kick, snare, hi-hat, or clap. 
Two similar samples of each pad’s respective sound type are played at the same time, 
with the tap position relative to the pad’s center determining a crossfade value 
between the two samples. The smaller back pads don’t detect this parameter, therefore 
only one sample is played when triggered. The velocity of the tap controls the overall 
gain of the sample(s), imitating the acoustic property of strike force directly relating to 
volume. This configuration provides dynamic percussion timbres and imitates the sonic 
changes when striking an acoustic drum head in different positions.
The guiro component triggers a pitched audio sample when any of its 11 ridges are 
touched. The playback speed for each ridge’s triggers range from the sample’s original 
speed to twice as fast, distributing pitches linearly across an octave.
Two mappings for the buttons on the top panel were explored over the course of the 
instrument’s creation. The first applies a delay effect to the overall audio. When a 
modulating button is pressed on the top panel, the corresponding side panel near the 
button acts as a delay effect modulator. The position where pressure is applied to the 
side panel modulates the delay rate, changing to 200 ms when pressing in the center 
and defaulting to 400 ms when no pressure is applied. The delay effect is set to 50% 
feedback and is applied to all output audio as long as the button is held down. The 
second mapping controls playback speed of the Slapbox’s audio over 3 octaves. The 
left button slows the playback speed of audio samples to half of the original, and the 
right button doubles the speed. In place of the delay functionality in the first mapping, 
this mapping retriggers audio samples at a fixed rate while pressure is applied to a pad 
after a strike.
Synthesis was implemented in C++, creating a simple granular engine to achieve 
polyphonic sampling by generating one grain per audio clip. In the case of the full pads 
with position estimation, this results in two grains, each with scaled gains according to 
the position crossfade value. Latency between a tap and its audio output was able to 
be reduced noticeably by reducing the audio block size to 32 samples per block.
Graphical User Interface
Aside from the visual feedback provided by the LEDs, a graphical user interface (GUI) 
was created to visualize pad strike position and intensity in real-time using Bela’s GUI 
framework. Though initially implemented as a debugging tool for visualizing gestural 
signals, it can also be used during a performance to further confirm the registration of 
interactions with the device. The interface presents a flattened version of the box’s

components that reflects their centroids, pressure and impulse status. Seen in Figure 
6, the line thickness of each panel’s outline represents pressure intensity, and the 
centroid is inscribed in each pad when pressure is applied. Automatic sensor 
normalization can be triggered with this interface to resolve sensor drift that may 
occur over time.
Evaluation and Future Work
Informal user evaluations were completed with two professional percussionists 
throughout the project to gauge the Slapbox’s fulfillment of its design goals and 
identify opportunities for improvement. Both participants are active performers 
currently pursuing a doctoral degree in percussion, one of whom had already 
incorporated digital percussion instruments and effects into their performances in the 
past. While both percussionists evaluated the instrument before the back panel was 
iterated upon, only the latter percussionist was able to return and try out the new 
features.
The two percussionists were told the Slapbox was a digital musical instrument for 
percussion performance and given unlimited time to play the instrument, typically 
jamming for about 30 minutes per session. They were asked to freely explore the 
instrument while providing feedback about its performance and playability from their 
own musical perspective. The instrument was used both on a table and on the user’s 
lap to explore different playing techniques.

Instrument Impressions
Both percussionists engaged with the Slapbox after only a few minutes of 
experimentation, achieving complex interactions in the form of fast tapping passages 
involving complex rhythms using several surfaces on the device. An example of early 
experimentation with the Slapbox from one of the users can be seen in Video 1.
Both performers noted that the LEDs on the tap panel were helpful indicators to 
confirm strikes on the box, and the GUI was able to help the participants better 
understand the functions of the drum pads. The cork surface was liked by both 
participants, but one of them had concerns of its durability due to its thickness. Both 
participants also regarded the instrument’s response time as immediate, which was 
one of the main goals of the design.
The delay modulation behavior using the buttons was well received, and one 
participant was able to create complex rhythms by weaving the delayed audio together 
from hits, seen in Video 2. One user suggested toggling the button effects instead of 
requiring them to be held down, as it took away much of the mobility in one hand when 
holding a button.

The false positive detections that are evident in Video 1 and Video 2 were substantially 
reduced with the new back panel implementation. The percussionist that evaluated the 
instrument after the changes noted “I like how it responds. Last time there was a bit 
more false triggering. In this [version], I feel a lot more in control of the instrument”. 
They also enjoyed the retriggering behavior and playing the pitched guiro ridges “like 
a marimba”, to complement the atonal percussion sounds from the other surfaces.
Interestingly, the playing technique of one of the percussionists changed when the 
retrigger behavior was added to the instrument. Instead of using fast strikes as in 
Video 1 and Video 2, the performer preferred to hold one or more surfaces to retrigger 
samples while playing with the octave-modulating buttons to achieve different 
variations of the sounds. Slightly changing the instrument’s mappings resulted in the 
user re-interpreting, or co-adapting [22], their playing techniques.

Future Work
Based on suggestions from the evaluations and design goals, there are many 
opportunities to continue development on the Slapbox. In particular, exploring sensor 
fusion with PVDF film or other transducers might enhance the accuracy of impulse 
detection.
Loading custom samples into the Slapbox was a popular request during the user 
evaluations, and could be accomplished using the GUI in a future iteration. Related to 
this, additional research could also explore new mappings between the device’s control 
space and sound synthesis. For example, percussion physical modeling synthesis could 
be used to imitate acoustic responses on a drum head using the position value from 
pads. The Slapbox’s interaction surfaces can also be used for non-percussive or 
harmonic mappings to explore its use in other musical contexts.
Conclusions
This paper has detailed the design of a new percussion DMI built on a framework of an 
existing instrument. Iterating on an existing instrument proved useful to address some 
previously identified areas for improving sensor design and interaction capabilities, 
while incorporating new features. Percussion gesture extraction methods were 
examined, giving sensor configuration insights from the instrument’s iterations. While 
further development is planned, initial evaluations were positive, and show promise for 
the Slapbox to become a robust, reliable instrument suitable for real-world use.
