ABSTRACT
Timbre is a primary mode of expression in diverse musical
contexts. However, prevalent audio-driven synthesis meth-
ods predominantly rely on pitch and loudness envelopes, ef-
fectively flattening timbral expression from the input. Our
approach draws on the concept of timbre analogies and
investigates how timbral expression from an input signal
can be mapped onto controls for a synthesizer. Leveraging
differentiable digital signal processing, our method facili-
tates direct optimization of synthesizer parameters through
a novel feature difference loss. This loss function, de-
signed to learn relative timbral differences between musical
events, prioritizes the subtleties of graded timbre modula-
tions within phrases, allowing for meaningful translations in
a timbre space. Using snare drum performances as a case
study, where timbral expression is central, we demonstrate
real-time timbre remapping from acoustic snare drums to a
differentiable synthesizer modeled after the Roland TR-808.

1. INTRODUCTION
Timbre is a musical concept that has distinctly resisted
precise definition in psycoacoustics and music psychology
research [31]. It has been referred to as the “psychoacous-
tician’s multidimensional waste-basket category for every-
thing that cannot be labeled pitch or loudness” [37, p.34].
Yet, within that multidimensional waste-basket resides a
rich landscape of musical expression. Timbre is central to

many musical traditions including Western classical music
[36], electronic music [46], and diverse percussion traditions
including tabla [7] and drum kit performance [9]. The sound
synthesizer has played a particularly important role in ex-
panding the timbral palette of musicians and entirely new
musical cultures have formed around their use [2]. Timbre
perception and synthesizers share a rich history, evidenced
by the significant body of literature following Wessel’s in-
troduction of the timbre space as a control interface in 1979
[62]. Furthermore, deep learning has enabled novel timbre-
focused synthesis tasks including timbral control [47] and
musical timbre transfer [25, 13].
Timbre transfer has received considerable attention in re-
cent years and refers to the task of altering “timbral infor-
mation in a meaningful way while preserving the hidden
content of performance control” [8, p.4]. One popular for-
mulation of this task was introduced by Engel et al. [13] and
involves learning a mapping from pitch and loudness control
signals to the timbre of a target instrument, expressed as
time-varying harmonic amplitudes. In other words, pitch
and loudness are explicit control signals and timbre is im-
plicitly learned, conditional on time-varying pitch and loud-
ness. The side-effect of this technique is that timbral expres-
sion is effectively ignored in the input signal. Whilst this
may suit musical contexts where pitch and loudness are the
primary parameters of expression, what about the myriad
contexts where this is not the case? In this paper we pro-
pose a novel, data-driven formulation for timbral control
of synthesizers using differentiable digital signal processing
(DDSP) [13], aiming to address musical contexts where tim-
bre is a primary vehicle for musical expression.
We draw on the idea of timbre remapping, introduced by
Stowell and Plumbley [54], who defined the task as mapping
trajectories between two distinct timbre spaces. This con-
cept bears similarity to the idea of timbre analogies [62, 38],
that is, transpositions of sequences within a timbre space,
and provides a conceptual starting point for our design.
Instead of learning to match absolute audio feature val-
ues, as is typical in AI-based audio synthesis, we propose to
learn to match relative differences in audio features. This
design decision is motivated by the role of timbre in the
structuring of musical phrases [36] and the importance of
subtle, graded timbral differences [61]. It is the relationship
between the timbres of neighboring musical events that is
important in the creation of a musical phrase, not the abso-
lute values of each individual event taken in isolation. This
is exemplified by drummers intentionally varying the inten-
sity and timbre of certain hits within a groove to provide
juxtaposition and indicate rhythmic intention [9].
To this end, we present a feature difference loss function
that considers pairs of sounds and differences between their
features as opposed to absolute values in isolated notes.
Paired with a differentiable synthesizer and a gradient-
based optimizer, this enables us to learn to adjust synthe-
sizer parameters to create timbral differences analogous to
those observed between successive events in a musical pas-
sage – remapping the timbre from a musical passage onto a
synthesizer.
As a case study, we consider the musical context of a snare
drum performance [9] and demonstrate how this method can
be used for timbre remapping from acoustic snare drums to
a differentiable synthesizer modeled after the Roland TR-
808 snare drum. An open source audio plug-in implement-
ing the real-time system and training scripts are presented
alongside this paper to allow musicians to experiment in
their own musical contexts. Reflections on a session with
a professional drummer are provided and point to both the
effectiveness of this approach as well as areas for future im-
provement. Recordings from this session and software are
available on a supplementary website1.
2. BACKGROUND
The work presented in this paper fits into the broader land-
scape of work focused on the development of novel con-
trollers and mappings for synthesizers [41]. It also con-
tributes to the growing body of literature in NIME on ma-
chine learning for musical expression [29].
2.1 Timbre Spaces and Timbre Analogies
The perceptual foundation of this work is the timbre space,
a multi-dimensional representation of sounds, derived from
listening studies on perceived similarity [18] and the lineage
of work that followed, seeking acoustic correlates with tim-
bre perception [19] (see [35] for an overview). The MPEG-7
standard [26] defined a set of audio features to quantify
timbre, although a multitude of other features have been
proposed [44] and are commonly used. The concept of tim-
bre analogies was first explored by Ehresman and Wessel in
1978 [12] and described transpositions of sequences within
a perceptual timbre space. Wessel subsequently discussed
timbre analogies in the context of musical control with tim-
bre spaces [62] and McAdams and Cunible verified the per-
ceptual viability of timbre analogies [38]. Perceptual studies
performed by these researchers utilized pairs of stimuli and
asked whether participants were sensitive to relative differ-
ences in timbre. More concretely, given a pair of sounds xa
and xb, participants were asked to select a soundxd (from a
set of choices) that differed from xc by the same amount as
xb differed from xa. Results showed that xd could be pre-
dicted by a parallelogram model of similarity within a per-
ceptual timbre space. From a geometric perspective, this
indicates that timbral sequences could be represented as
vectors in a multidimensional timbre space and translated
within that space while preserving the perception of relative
difference. While the perception of these relative differences
was not as strong as pitch and depended on the nature of
the relationship [38], it suggests that with the correct per-
ceptual scalings, translations of timbre are viable musical
operations – an idea we build upon in this work.
2.2 Perceptual Control of Synthesizers
Fasciani defines a synthesis method as being perceptually
related when it explicitly manipulates timbral attributes of
1https://jordieshier.com/projects/nime2024/
the generated sound [16]. Timbre remapping can be con-
sidered an example of a perceptual control method as it
seeks to explicitly manipulate timbre by mapping attributes
from an input source to the generated sound. Stowell and
Plumbley [54] introduced this concept and identified the
difficultly of the task when the distribution of timbres dif-
fer between the control and target contexts. As a practical
example, they presented the task of controlling a concate-
native synthesizer using an audio signal, building on the
work of Schwarz [50]. A key contribution by Stowell and
Plumbley [54, 55], [53, Chapter 5] is the recognition of the
context-dependent nature of timbre and multidimensional
interactions between various features. They proposed an
unsupervised regression tree method to learn associations
between the distinct timbre spaces of the input control and
synthesizer.
Another line of work considers the timbre space directly
as musical control structure. Building on Wessel’s 1979 pa-
per [62], several researchers have explored computational
methods for navigating timbre spaces with respect to syn-
thesis parameters [24, 17, 16, 52, 59]. Timbral exploration
methods are often motivated to cover the space of all pos-
sible sounds of a synthesizer to support searching; however,
this can make subtle timbral variations more challenging to
achieve [17]. It is these subtle timbral variations that we
turn our attention to in this work – “graded timbral dif-
ferences” that contribute to the perception of a continuous
musical phrase [61].
2.3 Differentiable Digital Signal Processing
Differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) was intro-
duced by Engel et al. alongside an implementation of a
harmonic plus noise synthesizer for modeling monophonic
and harmonic instruments [13]. DDSP enables the integra-
tion of DSP algorithms directly into neural network training
regimes, allowing for loss functions to be computed directly
on generated audio as opposed to parameter values, better
representing the complex relationship between the auditory
and parameter space [14]. Following the initial DDSP pa-
per, a large body of work on audio synthesis has followed ex-
ploring numerous synthesis methods including waveshaping
[21], FM [5, 63], subtractive [34], and filtered noise synthe-
sis [1]. Of particular relevance is the DDSP timbre transfer
task [13, 4], which follows naturally from the choice of pitch
and loudness as control signals. The timbre of an instru-
ment learned during training, represented by time-varying
harmonic amplitudes, can be mapped onto pitch and loud-
ness contours of a different instrument during inference. In
contrast to the DDSP timbre transfer formulation, we pro-
pose a method that considers how timbre can be explicitly
used as a control signal. For a full review of DDSP for audio
synthesis see Hayes et al. [23].
3. TIMBRE REMAPPING APPROACH
Here we outline the design of a timbre remapping approach,
building on the concept of timbre analogies within the
framework of DDSP. The goal is to transform the timbre
of a target synthesized sounds by mapping specific dimen-
sions of a performance from an input control signal, which
we assume includes variations in timbre that can be mea-
sured using acoustic features. We also assume that the in-
put and synthesized sounds occupy unique regions within a
multidimensional timbre space. Based on research on tim-
bre analogies introduced in section 2.1, we propose timbre
remapping via translation within a computational timbre
space. The basic idea is to measure how timbre changes

ogy. The sound pair (xa, xb) form a timbre sequence and

difference described by y to form the new pair (xc, xd).
across successive musical events in an input audio control
signal and translate those changes into synthesizer param-
eter modulations. In the next section we outline a method
for performing this using DDSP.
3.1 Learning Feature Differences
We start with a timbral sequence comprising two soundsxa
and xb from an input control source. A multidimensional
timbre space is defined by an arbitrary audio feature extrac-
tion algorithm f(·) that returns a multidimensional vector
of features. The timbral sequence can be described by the
vector resulting from taking the difference between audio
feature vector of xa and xb:
y = f(xb) − f(xa) (1)
Now, given a synthesizer g(·) and a preset θpre ∈ RP ,
where P is the number of synthesizer parameters, we can
synthesize an audio signal xc = g(θpre). We can also gener-
ate a modulated version of that preset by applying a param-
eter modulation θmod ∈ RP which results in a new synthe-
sized signal xd = g(θpre + θmod). This forms a new timbre
sequence:
ˆ y= f(xd) − f(xc) (2)
= f (g(θpre + θmod)) − f (g(θpre)) (3)
Our goal is to learn θmod such that ˆy = y. Figure 1 shows
a visual overview of this process. In this formulation, θpre
and xa are fixed and can be selected based on the musical
application. To situate this formulation within a gradient
descent-based machine learning paradigm, we introduce a
loss function to optimize θmod to match feature differences.
3.1.1 Feature Difference Loss
DDSP synthesizer training involves optimizing the param-
eters of synthesizer (and optionally a neural network that
predicts parameters) to minimize a loss function. Typically,
loss is computed between predicted audio and ground truth
audio using an auditory loss function such as the multi-scale
spectral loss [60]. This formulation minimizes the absolute
error between spectrograms with the objective of replicating
ground truth audio. However, we are interested in optimiz-
ing synthesizer parameters to match a difference in audio
features instead of matching the absolute values of features.
To this end, we define a feature difference loss:
L(ˆ y, y) = ∥ˆ y− y∥1 (4)
where ˆ yis the feature difference vector from equation 2, y
is the reference difference vector from equation 1, and ∥·∥1
is the L1 norm.
3.1.2 Optimization Target
If both g(·) and f(·) are differentiable functions then θmod
can be directly optimized using gradient descent. Putting
this all together, we arrive at a final optimization target:
ˆθmod = argminθmod∈RP L(ˆ y, y) (5)
This formulation makes no assumptions regarding the na-
ture of g(·) and f(·) and only requires differentiability, which
is relatively straightforward to achieve given the maturity of
modern auto-differentiation software2. In the next section
we provide a concrete example using this formulation.
4. CASE STUDY: SNARE DRUMS
As a case study we investigate the application of timbre
analogies and DDSP for timbre remapping within the musi-
cal context of snare drum performances. The design of this
study is motivated by prior work by Danielsen et al. [9],
which investigated the role of dynamic and timbral varia-
tion on snare drums within drum kit performances. They
found that drummers systematically varied intensity and
timbre of snare drum hits within grooves to signal rhyth-
mic and timing intentions. In this case study, we explore
how variations in a snare drum performance can be mapped
onto parameters of a snare drum synthesizer. Our goal is to
perform an initial evaluation of the proposed approach for
modeling timbre variation and to demonstrate a practical
example supporting real-time music interaction.
4.1 Differentiable Drum Synthesizer
The design of our differentiable drum synthesizer g(·) is
inspired by the popular Roland TR-808 snare drum. Al-
though it is relatively simple in design, the Roland TR-808
has found widespread use within popular music [20]. We
implemented a modified version of the TR-808 snare model
based on schematics provided by Gordon Reid [45]. A block
diagram of the synthesis model is shown in figure 2.
This synthesizer consists of two parallel paths, the first
comprises a pair of sinusoidal oscillators to generate the
main resonant frequencies and the second is a noise gener-
ator responsible for the sound of the “snares”. Each sinu-
soidal oscillator has a frequency parameter and a parameter
to control amount of frequency modulation applied by a con-
trol envelope. All sound sources have an independent am-
plitude control with gain and an envelope. Frequency and
amplitude envelopes are exponentially decaying envelopes
with control over the decay time. The noise source is fil-
tered with a high-pass biquad filter and uses the differen-
tiable implementation introduced by Yu and Fazekas [64].
We added a hyperbolic tangent waveshaper to the output as
we found the ability to add harmonics beneficial for shaping

transients in addition to being aesthetically pleasing. There
are fourteen synthesis parameters in total.
4.2 Audio Features
Next, we define a feature extraction algorithm f(·) for mea-
suring dynamic and timbre variations. The exact definition
of f(·) is not fixed and can be designed based on musical
context. Here, we select features based on Danielsen et
al. [9], who used sound pressure level, temporal centroid,
and spectral centroid. Their selection was motivated by the
MPEG-7 standard [26] and previous research on percussive
timbre analysis [32, 43]. We use this set of features and also
include spectral flatness [11] based on it’s inclusion in SP-
Tools3. Generally speaking, these features provide insight
into amplitude (sound pressure level), envelope shape (tem-
poral centroid), “brightness” (spectral centroid), and “nois-
iness” (spectral flatness). See Caetano et al. [3] for more
in-depth information on timbre-related audio descriptors.
All audio features, except for temporal centroid which
uses a 125ms window size, are computed using frame-based
processing with a window size of 46.4ms with 75% overlap.
Following recent suggestions [49], spectral features are win-
dowed using a flat-top window prior to the FFT and the
resulting magnitude spectrum is compressed using the fol-
lowing function: p(X) = log(1+X), where X is a magnitude
spectrum. These modifications were shown to produce a
smoother gradient for sinusoidal frequency estimation. Au-
dio feature time-series are summarized using the mean.
Building on Danielsen et al. [9], all features except for
temporal centroid are extracted from two temporal seg-
3https://github.com/rconstanzo/SP-tools
ments within the same audio sample. A short segment con-
taining Nt windows are selected from the onset to capture
transient phase information and a longer segment contain-
ing Ns windows are selected after theNt windows to capture
the sustain/decay phase information. The result is a seven
dimensional audio feature space consisting of both timbral
and dynamic features.
4.2.1 Psychophysical Scaling
Just as the equal-tempered scale enables transpositions of
melodies between different keys, we seek a scaling that al-
lows us to transpose sequences within the timbre/dynamic
space defined by our audio feature extraction algorithm.
Dynamic features, computed as the root mean square
(RMS), are converted to loudness, k-weighted, relative to
full-scale (LKFS) [58] by applying the following scaling func-
tion:
sLKFS(xRMS) = −0.691 + 10 log10(h(xRMS )) (6)
where h(·) is a K-weighting pre-emphasis filter.
Kazazis et al. [30] derived the following scaling function
for spectral centroid:
sSC(xSC) = −34.61x−0.1621
SC + 21.2985 (7)
where xSC is spectral centroid measured in hertz.
Temporal centroid is related to duration within our syn-
thesis framework. Schlauch et al. [48] found that perception
of duration in damped sounds is dependent on frequency
and timbre; however, derived power functions were all close
to d0.5 where d is duration. Accounting for the non-linear
relationship between temporal centroid and duration of the
exponential decay envelopes in our synthesizer, which was
empirically determined by sampling envelopes, we derived
the following psychophysical scaling for temporal centroid:
sTC(x) = 0.03x1.864
TC (8)
To our knowledge, there is no literature investigating the
perceptual scaling of spectral flatness; however, taking guid-
ance from the Librosa documentation [39], spectral flatness
is converted to a decibel scale: sSF(x) = 20 log10(xSF).
Now equipped with a differentiable synthesizer g(·) and
an audio feature extractor f(·) with perceptually informed
scalings, we are ready to define a machine learning task for
snare drum timbre remapping.
4.3 Real-Time Timbre Remapping
We now consider how these concepts can be applied to the
musical task of real-time control of a synthesizer. The pro-
posed system is inspired by the SP-Tools library, devel-
oped by percussionist and researcher Rodrigo Constanzo
using FluComa [56], and recent work on percussive DMI
control [33]. These works support real-time machine learn-
ing tasks using audio features extracted at detected onsets.
We explore here learning mappings between onset features
and synthesizer parameter modulations for real-time tim-
bral control. A diagram overviewing this approach is pro-
vided in Figure 3.
We frame timbre remapping as a regression problem and
use a data-driven approach to model the relationship be-
tween onset features and parameter modulations. The goal
is to estimate synthesizer parameter modulations ˆθmod from
short-term audio features fo(x), where fo is an onset fea-
ture extractor andx audio from a single acoustic snare drum

Figure 3: Real-time timbre remapping experiment overview. We learn a mapping network mϕ(·) to predict synthesizer
parameter modulations θmod to create timbre analogies. Feature differences y are measured between two input sounds (xa, xb)
and mϕ(·) learns to modulate a synthesizer preset θpre to create a synthesized sound pair (xc, xd) with a feature difference ˆ y.
The feature difference loss measures the error between y and ˆ y. Real-time remapping is enabled by onset features f0(·), which
are measured on a short window of audio at a detected onset and are used as input to the mapping network.
strike. To do so we introduce a mapping functionmϕ(·) that
outputs parameter modulations given onset features:
ˆθmod = mϕ(fo(x)) (9)
where ϕ are the learnable model parameters.
Now our objective is to learn ϕ to estimate ˆθmod to mini-
mize the feature difference loss instead of directly optimiz-
ing ˆθmod. To return to the concept of timbre analogies as
a method for mapping, we construct a dataset of timbral
sequences from an audio dataset of snare drum hits (e.g.,
snare drum hits extracted from a performance). This is
done by selecting a reference sample xa from the dataset
and then measuring the difference between that and every
other sample in the dataset. The reference sample acts as
an anchor point in the dataset from which timbral/dynamic
variations extend from and defines the sound for which the
synthesizer preset is unmodulated (i.e., θmod = 0).
Onset features are derived from a subset of features used
in SP-Tools and are RMS, spectral centroid, and spectral
flatness computed on a buffer of 256 samples after a detected
onset. Spectral features are computed on a magnitude spec-
trum and time domain samples are windowed with a Hann
window prior to an FFT. Onset detection is computed using
an amplitude-based method derived on an implementation
in the FluComa library [56] (AmpFeature4) and used in SP-
Tools. All onset features are normalized to a [0 , 1] range.
5. EXPERIMENTS
Initial experimentation preceded the development of the
concepts outlined in this paper and consisted of a manually-
tuned mapping strategy where linear relationships between
onset features and synthesis parameters were specified by
a user on a user interface – no machine learning involved.
This straightforward approach enabled everyday objects to
be struck, transforming them into different elements of a
synthetic drum kit. Furthermore, we presented this ver-
sion of the project at the Agential Insrtuments Workshop
4https://learn.flucoma.org/reference/ampfeature/
at the 2023 AI and Music Creativity conference, where it
was integrated into a project completed by two workshop
participants.
This early success encouraged us to further develop this
idea and address some of the main limitations: 1) manual-
mapping is effective when there are relatively few fea-
tures and synthesis parameters, but becomes unwieldy as
complexity increases; 2) developing non-linear relationships
with interdependencies between features is infeasible with
manual-mapping; 3) creating mappings that lead to realis-
tic graded timbral changes can be challenging. The ideas
presented in this paper represent our attempt to address
some of the challenges. Whilst we don’t directly compare
the manual mapping approach with the data-driven map-
pings in this paper, in the following subsections we present a
series of numerical and musical experiments with the goal of
providing insight into the efficacy and musical affordances
of our timbre remapping design.
5.1 Numerical Experiments
Numerical experiments included training a set of different
models to conduct real-time timbre remapping using an
dataset of snare drum performances. We use subsets of the
Snare Drum Dataset (SDSS) [6] to train and evaluate the
real-time mapping model. In total there are 48 unique per-
formances and each recording contains between 50 to 120
(median 85) different hits. We select audio from single mi-
crophone (an AKG-414 positioned on the top of the drum).
A full dataset for training a single model is one performance.
To generate timbral/dynamic analogies for each dataset,
onset features and full audio features were computed for
each individual drum and a reference drum soundxa was se-
lected using the median value of transient LKFS. We found
this feature correlated with strike velocity in a preliminary
study and provides a reasonable centre point in the audio
feature space to generate timbral/dynamic analogies from.
Testing and validation splits were created from each dataset
using approximately ten percent of the samples, selected to
roughly cover the dynamic range of the dataset. Five differ-
ent synthesizer presets were manually programmed to serve
as the starting point for timbre analogies. Combining the
48 performances with five different presets meant that 240
individual models were trained for each variation during ex-
perimentation.
5.1.1 Models and Training
Three different model variations were included for experi-
mentation. Two models based on the multi-layer percep-
tron (MLP) used by Engel et al. [13] were included. One
with a single layer containing 32 hidden units (590 param-
eters) and a larger model with three layers of 64 hidden
units (9.5k parameters). A linear model was also included
for experimentation, which reflects the mapping capability
of the aforementioned manual-mapping method.
Two window sizes for onset features were also included,
one with short-term features of 256 samples, and one with a
larger window of 2048 samples. The larger window (≈ 43ms
at 48kHz) would have too much latency for real-time percus-
sion performance, which has an upper perceptual threshold
of about 10ms [27]. We include this larger window to in-
vestigate the benefit of providing more temporal context
during training. Parameters were also directly optimized to
match differences (i.e., no modeling) to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of the feature difference loss and provide an upper
bound on performance.
Each model was trained for 250 epochs using an Adam
optimizer and the learning rate was halved if validation loss
did not improve for 20 epochs. To prevent over utilization of
oscillator frequency parameters, modulations for those two
controls were damped by a factor of 1e-3. Training a model
takes under 2 minutes on a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti
GPU and about 13 minutes on the CPU of a MacBook Pro
M1. A full listing of hyperparmaters and model details are
listed on the supplementary website.
5.1.2 Results
Metrics reporting how accurately each model variant was
able to match audio feature differences are shown in ta-
ble 1. All results were computed using samples from test-
ing datasets and results are summarized with mean and
standard deviation across all SDSS performance and preset
pairs. The preset column shows the feature difference error
computed against the preset before any optimization to pro-
vide a performance baseline – this would represent a one-
shot triggering scenario. The direct optimization results
performed the best across all features, which is as expected
since no model is being trained to estimated parameters.
While the non-linear MLP models tend to provide better
feature matching capabilities across most features, they are
not significantly better than the best linear model. These
results show that we were able to relatively accurately learn
to map synthesizer parameter changes using this approach
compared to the baseline direct optimization and that these
relationships can be modeled within a single snare drum
performance with relatively simple models.
5.2 Musical Experiments
Deruty et al. [10] emphasize working alongside musicians in
the development AI-tools and highlight the importance of
creating usable prototypes that function within a musicians
typical workflow. To facilitate experimentation within the
intended musical context, an audio plug-in was developed
to perform real-time timbre remapping. The only differ-
ence between the plug-in and training is that the audio fea-
ture extraction algorithms and synthesizer was re-written
in C++ (as opposed to Python) and a rolling feature nor-
malizer was added to ensure that input features were in the
correct [0, 1] range. The plug-in, source code, and record-
ings from the musical experiment are available on the sup-
plementary website.
We conducted an informal session with professional drum-
mer Carson Gant to record musical examples to accompany
this paper and help situate this work within the practice
of a groove-based drummer. The goal of this session was
provide initial feedback of our approach within a musical
context and is not intended to replace a formal user study,
which the authors plan to conduct at a later date. Carson
provided short recordings of performances on two different
snare drums with and without dampening, which were used
to train models ahead of our session. An important distinc-
tion between the recordings received from Carson and the
SDSS dataset is that Carson played a much wider range of
gestures including buzz roles and rim clicks.
After playing for a period of time, Carson remarked
“there is some subtleness to it where you’re not getting one-
shotted5, there are subtle changes to it ... it’s nice to hear,
it’s reacting ... it’s just figuring out how to play it and what
causes it to trigger [or not]”. This statement points to both
a success of the timbre remapping in creating subtle vari-
ations and a limitation of relying on onset detection. Car-
son’s statement reflects findings by Jack et al. [28], who ob-
served percussionists reducing their gestural language when
confronted with the bottleneck of discrete onset detection
in a percussive DMI. It is worth noting that the setup in our
session, which used a dynamic microphone as input, repre-
sents a challenging scenario for onset detection and could
likely be significantly improved with the introduction of a
drum trigger (p.c., Rodrigo Constanzo).
Carson played several different models, remarking that
some “felt more reactive” or “were triggering better.” This
was interesting as the onset detection and triggering is sep-
arate from the mapping model. This points to a perceptual
connection between the variation in sound produced and
a sensation of reactiveness. A feeling of less reactivity was
particularly salient in presets that contained higher levels of
filtered noise. Small adjustments in high-pass filter parame-
ters (cut-off and q) created perceptually significant changes
and minor variations in the input features tended to feel
over-emphasized. Carson mentioned that this resulted in
a sensation of randomness, although also commented that
playing on the edge of the drum resulted in one sound and in
the middle another, suggesting that macro control worked
well, but granular control over noise was marginal. This
variability could also be attributed in part to the feature
normalization in the audio plug-in, which would update over
time and could cause outputs to change over time.
6. DISCUSSION
6.1 Differentiable Timbre Space
The timbre space has proved an enduring concept for control
of sound synthesizers. The marriage of DDSP with timbre
space in this work offers a novel perspective, enabling the
direct learning of synthesis parameters from audio exam-
ples, circumventing the need for supervision on parameters
[59] or generative training on large datasets [42]. Expressing
perceptual knowledge directly within our DDSP training al-
gorithm allowed us to explicitly specify the musical concepts
that we deemed important for the task at hand. In this

repeatedly, sometimes called a “machine-gun effect” [15]

case, we highlighted the importance of timbral differences
between events in a musical phrase by using a feature differ-
ence loss. This enabled the efficient training of lightweight
models capable of performing real-time timbre remapping.
However, representing a sound as a point in a multidimen-
sional and numerical timbre space also involves a reduction
– a timbral bottleneck – similar to the gestural bottleneck
introduced through onset detection [28]. Bottlenecks in our
design had implications that were reflected in our musical
experiment and reveal avenues for future investigation.
6.2 Limitations
The proposed feature difference loss was designed under
the assumption that timbre variations can be represented
as vectors in a computational timbre space and that vec-
tors with the same direction (but different origins) will be
perceived similarly. Previous research on timbre analogies
and scaling of timbre-related audio descriptors supports this
assumption, and our musical experiment offers an initial
practice-based evaluation of its perceptual relevance. Fur-
ther investigation into the perceptual relevance of the pro-
posed method in psychoacoustical and musical contexts will
be both enlightening and important for future development
in this direction. Additionally, the choice of reference in the
feature difference loss has implications on the end result and
future work can explore different formulations such as dy-
namic references that are updated based on shorter musical
phrases.
While DDSP offers numerous benefits, it also introduces
some unique challenges. The difficulty of optimizing fre-
quency with respect to audio loss functions is well-known
[57, 34]. Our training scenario avoided the need to directly
learn frequency; however, we observed uninformative gradi-
ents with respect to frequency parameters. The impact of
uninformative gradients meant model weight initialization
had a large impact on training and necessitated the use of
frequency parameter dampening to mitigate bad solutions.
Despite these challenges, and in light of the clear aforemen-
tioned benefits and recent insights in DDSP optimization
[22, 49], we feel that continued research in this direction
is merited. Future work comparing non-differentiable ap-
proaches [59] would also be worthwhile.
6.3 Opportunities
Beyond the real-time percussive timbre remapping appli-
cation presented in this work, there are numerous applica-
tions of timbre remapping with DDSP. We highlight a few
here. A simple extension of our current work is explore
the benefits of exposing direct parametric control over tim-
bral features. In our case study, onset features are used
as input to the parameter mapping neural network. How-
ever, there is no reason why values from an external con-
troller couldn’t be mapped to these. One application that
we have already started to explore is mapping MIDI and
MPE values from a controller like the Ableton Push6. This
could enable more nuanced timbral control over synthesis
parameters in finger-drumming and other controller-based
performance contexts. Furthmore, parametric timbre con-
trol could be used in sound design applications or to cre-
ate stimuli for perceptual studies where independent control
over individual features is beneficial and typically relies on
additive synthesis [30]. Creation of meaningful variations in
sounds is an another active area of research for drum one-
shots [15] and sound effects for video games [51]. Timbre
variations could be learned in a data-driven manner from
sample libraries, for instance, by creating differentiable im-
plementations of procedural synthesis methods [40].
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper we have explored how timbre analogies and
differentiable audio synthesis can be leveraged together for
the task of timbre remapping. Specifically, we sought to
map subtle timbral changes from acoustic instruments onto
controls for a synthesizer, motivated by musical contexts
where timbre is a primary vehicle for expression. By ex-
pressing synthesis and feature extraction algorithms differ-
entiably, and through the use of our proposed feature dif-
ference loss function, we showed how we could learn to ad-
just synthesis parameters to match timbral and loudness
feature sequences. Importantly, we matched differences, as
opposed to absolute values audio features, which empha-
sized the importance of trajectories in timbre space and
enabled remapping. This was shown in a concrete exam-
ple that explored real-time remapping from acoustic snare
drum performances to a differentiable drum synthesizer in-
spired by the Roland TR-808.
