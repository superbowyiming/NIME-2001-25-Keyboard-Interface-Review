ABSTRACT
This paper explores the roles of technical and musical famil-
iarity in shaping audience response to digital musical instru-
ment (DMI) performances. In an audience study conducted
during an evening concert, we examined two primary ques-
tions: ﬁrst, whether a deeper understanding of how a DMI
works increases an audience’s enjoyment and interest in the
performance; and second, given the same DMI and same
performer, whether playing in a conventional (vernacular)
versus an experimental musical style aﬀects an audience’s
response. We held a concert in which two DMI creator-
performers each played two pieces in diﬀering styles. Be-
fore the concert, each half the 64-person audience was given
a technical explanation of one of the instruments. Results
showed that receiving an explanation increased the reported
understanding of that instrument, but had no eﬀect on ei-
ther the reported level of interest or enjoyment. On the
other hand, performances in experimental versus conven-
tional style on the same instrument received widely diver-
gent audience responses. We discuss implications of these
ﬁndings for DMI design.

1. INTRODUCTION
This paper investigates the factors shaping the audience ex-
perience in digital musical instrument (DMI) performances,
comparing the relative eﬀects of familiarity with the opera-
tion of the instrument and familiarity with the musical style
of the performance.
Visual factors play a central role in how a spectator per-
ceives a performance [23, 22, 5, 17, 11, 14] for both tradi-
tional and digital instruments (see [9] for a detailed discus-
sion of instrumental interaction from the spectator perspec-
tive). DMI performances are often criticised for being visu-
ally opaque [22, 5]. Fels et al. [6] proposed the principle of

.
transparency, suggesting that the instrument design should
allow the audience to understand the performer-instrument
interaction. Since DMIs need not follow traditional instru-
mental modes of interaction [9], considerable eﬀort has been
spent on DMIs which deliberately seek to expose the inter-
action to the audience. Recent work has proposed physical
metaphors [3] and visualisations of control processes [1, 19],
and audience experience is increasingly a part of the DMI
evaluation process [16].
Fyans et al. [7] conducted a study of audience perception
of error in DMI performance under diﬀerent information
conditions. Amongst the ﬁndings was that, with regards to
the Tilt-Synth (an unfamiliar DMI), explaining the instru-
ment before the performance improved the accuracy of the
spectators’ mental models of the instrument (though it had
no signiﬁcant eﬀect on understanding the performer’s inten-
tion in playing the instrument). Several participants sug-
gested “that they enjoyed the performances more because
the performer explained the the instrument ﬁrst. They com-
mented that it helped them understand the interaction and
performance.”
This suggestion has yet to be conﬁrmed, as no study
has measured whether understanding how a DMI works
improves audience enjoyment of a performance. The pre-
concert talk or demo is a staple of many performances, and
it seems plausible that greater familiarity with the opera-
tion of the instrument might help a spectator relate to the
actions of the performer and thereby facilitate greater en-
joyment of the performance. The study presented in this
paper examines this question in a concert setting by giving
each half of the audience a technical introduction to one of
the two instruments used during the performances.
1.1 The Instrument and the Piece
Any investigation of familiarity and audience experience
must confront a signiﬁcant confounding factor: musical style.
DMIs can be found all along the artistic spectrum, from tra-
ditional instrumental models to interactive compositions.
At one end of the spectrum, the DMI is often insepara-
ble from the musical idiom and even the speciﬁc piece [5,
15] (see also Jorda’s discussion of macro-diversity [12] as a
measure of stylistic ﬂexibility).
This close bond between technology and musical ideas
may be inherent in the design of some instruments, though
in other cases it may relate more to the fact that the instru-
ment’s designer is its primary (or only) performer. Musical
history is replete with cases where instruments developed
for one community found distinctive use in another (e.g.
saxophone, bandoneon, electric guitar, Hammond organ).
On DMIs, diversity of style is also an emergent property of
even the most reductive designs when given to many diﬀer-
ent players [10, 26].
In any case, a note of caution is warranted in audience
200
studies. Given a DMI which is tightly linked to a musi-
cal context, eﬀects on the audience which appear to be due
to technical design may instead be eﬀects the style of the
performance (or vice-versa). In this paper, in addition to
examining technical familiarity, we study the eﬀect of musi-
cal style along the spectrum of experimental to conventional
or vernacular.
1.2 Aesthetic Origins of NIME
There is no single NIME musical aesthetic, but certain his-
torical traditions have had stronger inﬂuences than others,
with electroacoustic free improvisation perhaps the most
signiﬁcant. The origins of this tradition far predate dig-
ital technology. Though early electronic instruments like
the Trautonium, theremin, ondes martenot and Electronic
Sackbut might be the natural technical forebears of NIME
[18], the aesthetic origins may owe at least as much to Rus-
solo’s futurism [21] and the modernist, timbre-focused tra-
dition of Var` ese and his followers. For Var` ese, as for present-
day NIME, new musical forms and new instrument technol-
ogy were closely intertwined: “Our musical alphabet must
be enriched. We also need new instruments very badly ...
which can lend themselves to every expression of thought
and can keep up with thought” (1916, quoted in [25]).
A complete discussion of the aesthetic history of NIME
is beyond the scope of this paper, though Demers [4] pro-
vides a detailed analysis of aesthetic considerations in re-
cent experimental electronic music. The path to NIME runs
through Schaeﬀer’s musique concr` eteand the experimental-
ism of Cage, who brought about a radical shift in the role
of the score from a musical ideal to a space of possibilities
or recipes relying on chance and contributions from the per-
former (and sometimes the audience) for completion. Cage
is noted for inventing and re-purposing musical instruments,
most famously the prepared piano, but he was also a techni-
cal pragmatist, remarking “technology essentially is a way
of getting more done with less eﬀort” [13]. (Gurevich [8]
provides a more extensive account of Cage’s aesthetics in
relation to NIME by way of recreating several of his works
with modern digital technology.)
In parallel with the experimental electroacoustic tradi-
tion, electronics have become deeply integrated in the mu-
sical vernacular, with early examples ranging from Wendy
Carlos’ 1968 Switched-On Bach to the international success
of Kraftwerk to the ubiquity of the Minimoog [20], Yamaha
DX-7 and other synths in rock music of the 1970s and 80s.
DJ practice has led a trend toward loop-based music, now
often entirely electronic in origin. Hundreds of micro-genres
exist within the domain of electronic dance music (EDM),
with widely varying aesthetic concerns [4].
1.3 Implications
It is worth highlighting the parallel experimental and ver-
nacular streams of digital music because the lack of visibility
of performance gesture aﬀects both sets of genres. Ableton
Live performers can encounter as much criticism as experi-
mental DMI creators for visually disengaging performances;
live generative visuals are also found across many electronic
genres. But NIME and EDM performances engage the au-
dience in diﬀerent ways and invite diﬀerent modes of lis-
tening, and the popularity of live EDM performances with
or without visual accompaniment suggests that instrumen-
tal transparency is not a strict prerequisite to an enjoyable
performance.
The prior listening experience of the audience is another
consideration. Audiences outside the NIME community are
less likely to be familiar with electroacoustic improvisa-
tion. Even within NIME, most practitioners wear many

hats: composer, performer, instrument designer, audience
member. In many cases, the musical genres that a NIME
community member listens to in their leisure time may only
partly overlap with the genres they participate in in their
professional practice.
Understanding and instrumental transparency may have
cultural as well as technical dimensions. The musical expe-
rience of the audience may aﬀect their understanding of a
performance whether or not they have encountered a par-
ticular DMI before. In the next section, we describe a study
aimed at disentangling some of these eﬀects, with the goal
of providing design advice for future DMI creators.
2. STUDY DESIGN
This study was carried out as part of an evening concert
on the theme of Innovative Interfaces, as part of the C4DM
Concert Series at Queen Mary University of London.
2.1 Performers
The study involved two performers who each play a novel,
self-built electronic instrument: Dianne Verdonk on the Di-
antenne [24], and Tim Exile on the Flow Machine 1 (Figure
1). Both performers had signiﬁcant live performance experi-
ence with their instrument, and both had previously played
their instruments in contrasting musical styles.
To create the familiar/unfamiliar contrast for the musi-
cal style, we asked each musician to prepare 2 performances,
each around 5 minutes in length. The ﬁrst was freely ex-
perimental, and the second more stylistically conventional
(or vernacular). We invited the performers to interpret “ex-
perimental” and “conventional” in the context of their own
musical practice.
2.2 Pre-Concert Presentations
The investigator ﬁrst gave a short introduction to the au-
dience on the purpose of the study. The audience (n=64)
was then randomly divided into two groups, and each group
saw one of two instrument tutorials. The tutorials each ex-
plained the technical aspects of one of the instruments and
how it creates sound. One group (n=34) received the tu-
torial on Tim Exile’s Flow Machine, and the other (n=30)

received the tutorial on Dianne Verdonk’s Diantenne. The
tutorials were presented by a member of the research lab to
address any bias from meeting the performer prior to the
concert.
2.3 Concert Order
No single concert order can entirely address order bias ef-
fects (see Section 4.5 for further discussion), but for con-
sistency, we chose to place the experimental performances
together at the beginning, followed by the conventional per-
formances. Both instruments were ampliﬁed, but since Di-
anne’s was designed to be quieter than Tim’s, Dianne per-
formed ﬁrst. The order is detailed in Table 1.
2.4 Data collection
The data for this study was collected in two ways: By 5
written questionnaires2, and by real-time audience feedback
via a custom-made web app. (For space reasons this paper
only considers data from the written questionnaires; a fu-
ture paper will consider the real-time data.)
2.4.1 Post-Performance Questionnaires
4 of the 5 questionnaires were short surveys that were ﬁlled
out immediately after each performance (3-4 minutes were
given for this), and asked the participants to reﬂect on what
they had just heard. The participant was asked to rate their
Enjoyment, Interest and Understanding of the performance
they had just seen on a scale of 1 (least) to 5 (most).
There were also three qualitative questions with space
provided for about two sentences. These asked what the
participant liked, didn’t like, and how they might describe
the performance to a friend.
2.4.2 Post-Concert Questionnaire
After the ﬁnal performance and questionnaire, participants
were asked to ﬁll out a longer post-concert survey. This
asked the participants to reﬂect on the performances as a
whole; to rank the 4 performances in order of preference
from 1 (favourite) to 4 (least favourite); to rate how well
they understood each performer’s instrument, and then to
rate if they would be able to play it.
This survey also collected demographic detail. This data
allowed us to further subdivide the audience, as discussed
in Section 4.3.
3. RESULTS
3.1 Ratings of Performances
First, we looked at the ratings of Enjoyment, Interest and
Understanding for each of the four performances. These
were rated in each of the 4 post-performance questionnaires
on a scale of 1 to 5.
For insight into the inﬂuence of instrument familiarity
(Figure 2) we examined average ratings across all perfor-
mances by the group that saw the tutorial before the per-
formance versus the group that did not. The ratings for In-
terest and Enjoyment were nearly identical for both groups.
However, we observed a larger diﬀerence in Understanding:
those who saw the instrument before the concert rated Un-
derstanding an average of 0.53 points higher.
We then examined the ratings for each performance as
a function of whether the audience was familiar or unfa-
miliar with the instrument (Figure 3). Refer to Table 1
for performance numbering. For Interest and Enjoyment,
the group not familiar with the instrument rated Interest
and Enjoyment slightly higher for P1 (∆I=0.21, ∆E=0.27),
and rated the same aspects slightly lower for P2 (∆I=0.20;

mances. Each audience member will be counted in the

iar” group for the other. (Error bars indicate standard
error on this and all other plots.)
∆E=0.28). For P3 and P4 the ratings of Enjoyment and
Interest were virtually identical. For all four performances,
the group familiar with the instrument consistently rated
Understanding higher (∆U = 0.7, 0.61, 0.55, 0.27 for P1 to
P4 respectively).
Next, we analysed this rating data with respect to musi-
cal style (Figure 4). We found that Enjoyment was rated
substantially higher for the two conventional performances
(∆E=1.05) and that Interest and Understanding showed
smaller increases for the conventional performances (∆I=0.31,
∆U=0.34).
We then contrasted the overall ratings of Enjoyment, In-
terest and Understanding to compare the experimental and
conventional performances by each performer. For both
performers, Enjoyment showed the biggest positive change
(0.71 for Dianne, 1.39 for Tim). The meaning and implica-
tions of these values are further explored in Section 4.
3.2 Rank Ordering of Performances
In the ﬁnal post-concert survey, participants were asked to
rank the performances in order of preference (1=favourite,
4=least favourite). We compared these values overall, as
well as with respect to instrument familiarity. (Respondents
who did not ﬁll in all four ranks are excluded from our
analysis.)
The ranking showed a preference for the conventional
style performances, ranked from favourite to least favourite:
1. P4 (Tim, Conventional: 1.5, SD=0.73)
2. P3 (Dianne, Conventional: 2.19, SD=1.05)
3. P1 (Dianne, Experimental: 2.90, SD=0.93)
4. P2 (Tim, Experimental: 3.40, SD=0.69)
We then examined these rankings with respect to receiv-
ing a tutorial on the instrument (Figure 5). The rank order
remained the same for both groups, but the strength of
preferences changed: the experimental performances were
ranked marginally higher by the group receiving the tutorial
(diﬀerences: P1=0.21; P2=0.18). The opposite was true for
the conventional performances: those not familiar with the
instrument preferred these more strongly than those who
were familiar with it (diﬀerences: P3=0.34; P4=0.33).
3.3 Thematic Analysis
In addition to the quantitative data, we analysed the qual-
itative data using an inductive method [2] that identiﬁed
themes emerging from responses. These themes were then
grouped together until saturation. We found that that of
the responses that contained at least one word (n=665),
97% could ﬁt in at least one of four categories:
202
Figure 3: Ratings by performance, by those who saw the instrument and those who did not
1. The Performer: the input; how the interface is used
2. The Instrument: the interface; how the sound is made
3. The Sound: the output, describing the sounds heard
4. The Experience: the respondent’s perception/value
judgment of what they have heard
The remaining 3% of responses could not be categorised.
The majority of these were responses such as “Nothing”
when the participant was asked to detail what they disliked.
Responses were categorised as Performer, Instrument and/or
Sound if they speciﬁcally described one of these aspects.
The categorisation of Experience was used if they did not
describe speciﬁcally the Performer, Sound or Instrument,
but described the eﬀect on the respondent’s experience or
personal judgment. The Experience categorisation was also
added if the respondent described one of the three former
categories as well as how it aﬀected them or a value judg-
ment about it. For example, describing a performance as “it
sounded like a drum” would be categorised as Sound, while
“it sounded like a drum and made me want to dance” would
be categorised as both Sound and Experience.
We counted the number of categorisations made for each
of the three questions for performance. The majority of
responses (71%) cited one categorisation, and 27% of re-
sponses cited two categorisations. We examined the cate-
gorisations that respondents used by considering the pro-
portion of the audience that cited each categorisation in
their “like” and “dislike” responses. No patterns stood out
with respect to familiarity with the instrument, but sev-
eral suggestive features emerged in relation to musical style,
which are discussed further in Sections 4.4 and 4.5.
4. DISCUSSION
4.1 Inﬂuence of Instrument Familiarity
Our results strongly suggest that being familiar with the in-
strument (when this means prior technical knowledge) does
not have any appreciable impact on audience interest or en-
joyment. We did, however, observe a diﬀerence in the rating
of understanding between the group who was familiar with
the instrument and the group that was not, with the famil-
iar group consistently rating understanding higher than the
unfamiliar group.
However, it is important to reﬂect on what that rating
of “understanding” might mean in this context, and how it
relates to Fels’s notion of transparency [6], described as “a
quality of a mapping ... transparency provides an indica-
tion of the psychophysiological distance, in the minds of the
player and the audience, between the input and output of
a device mapping.” By this deﬁnition, transparency is a
deeper, nuanced understanding of an instrument, its physi-
cal and psychological aspects, and how it creates sound; for
this study, we gave each group a technical tutorial on one
instrument, which provides familiarity, but does not neces-
sarily impact transparency.
This is further evidenced when, in the ﬁnal questionnaire,
we asked participants to rate their overall understanding of
each instrument as well as their ability to play it (Figure
6). Those receiving a tutorial rated their understanding
as higher than those who did not. However, there was no
diﬀerence between the two groups in their rating of their
ability to play the instrument, which was lower than both
ratings of understanding. It may be that believing one can
play an instrument indicates a deeper intuitive understand-
ing of how it works, reﬂecting more than passing technical
knowledge.
4.2 Inﬂuence of Musical Style
While instrument familiarity appeared to have no eﬀect on
reported Enjoyment, performances in a conventional musi-
cal style were rated more highly for Enjoyment whether or
not the audience received a tutorial on the instrument. To
a lesser degree, Interest and Understanding were also rated
higher for the conventional performances.
The same style-dependent eﬀect was evident in the rank
ordering of the performances, but with subtle diﬀerences
between groups: being unfamiliar with an instrument that
is played in a familiar style, and being familiar with an
instrument played in an experimental style, have positive
eﬀects. This suggests perhaps that one axis of familiarity

ings, experimental vs conventional

Figure 7: Average diﬀerence in ratings, those who do vs do not

Figure 8: Rank ordering by those who

is most eﬀective, and this is perhaps a fruitful direction for
future study.
4.3 Inﬂuence of Listening Preferences
The demographic data in the ﬁnal questionnaire collected
information on the audience’s listening habits. Using this
data were able to further subdivide the audience into those
who were listeners of electronic music (n=25) and those
who were not (n=39). Figure 7 shows the individual per-
formance ratings with respect to these listening preferences.
For all four performances, those who listened to electronic
music rated Understanding higher than those who did not.
The diﬀerence between groups was larger for the experimen-
tal performances. This might indicate intrinsic familiarity
with electronic musical instruments through prior listening
or concert attendance.
We had hypothesised that electronic music listeners would
also rate Enjoyment and Interest higher, as they may be
more likely to be familiar with the experimental playing
style. However, this eﬀect was not observed. For P2 (Tim’s
experimental performance), electronic music listeners rated
Enjoyment 0.52 points higher than their counterparts, but
no overall eﬀect is evident.
The rank ordering by listening preference (Figure 8) shows
that the conventional performances (P3 and P4) were pre-
ferred to the experimental ones (P1 and P2) for both groups.
However, electronic music listeners ranked Tim’s and Di-
anne’s experimental performances nearly identically, where
the other group showed a clear preference for Dianne’s ex-
perimental performance. These results suggest that audi-
ence listening habits do have an eﬀect on perception, but
the precise nature of that role requires further study.

categorisation; contrasting answers to questions of
likes and dislikes
4.4 Qualitative Data and Salience
The thematic analysis oﬀers a high-level view of which as-
pects of each performance were salient to the audience. Ex-
amining which aspects appear more frequently in positive
(“like”) or negative (“dislike”) comments oﬀers some insight
into the reasons behind the quantitative results discussed in
the previous sections.
Figure 9 shows the overall proportion of the group that
mentioned each category (Performer, Instrument, Sound,
Experience) in Likes and Dislikes. A notable result is the
role of sound, which is mentioned more often as a Like for
conventional performances and as a Dislike for experimental
performances. The instrument is rarely mentioned as a Dis-
like in any performance; in fact, in the second (conventional)
performances it is rarely mentioned at all (though this may
be a precedence eﬀect, discussed in the next section). The
proportion of the audience citing the performer as a Like
is also lower in the conventional performance. These re-
sults reinforce our earlier ﬁnding that musical style plays
a stronger role than instrument design (or even how the
instrument is played) in shaping the audience experience.
4.5 Order Effects
With only one concert, it was impossible to completely sep-
arate the order of presentation from the diﬀerences in mu-
sical style. Therefore it is reasonable to ask whether eﬀects
apparently due to style are in fact byproducts of the fact
that the experimental performances came ﬁrst.
The precedence eﬀect may underlie the increased Under-
standing rating for both instruments from the ﬁrst to the
second performance of each, though it is also possible that
if the style was more familiar to a particular audience mem-
ber, they would ﬁnd it easier to understand the instrument.
The Interest rating of P3 (Dianne’s conventional perfor-
mance) dips compared to P1, with a larger drop for the
group that did not see her instrument before the concert.
This may suggest a mild novelty eﬀect for P1. However, this
novelty eﬀect did not reduce Enjoyment, as ratings went up
for both P3 and P4 compared to P1 and P2.
A ﬁnal eﬀect attributable to precedence is that the in-
strument is hardly discussed at all in the qualitative data
for P3 and P4 (Figure 8), where it was discussed in 18%
of the Like responses for P1 and P2. This suggests that
audience members made their comments on the instrument
in the ﬁrst performance and did not repeat them.
On the other hand, the change in Enjoyment ratings is
unlikely to be from precedence alone. Likewise, the fact that
sound is described proportionally more in Like for the con-
ventional performances and in Dislike for the experimental
performances is unlikely to result from the concert order.
5. CONCLUSIONS
Contrary to the suggestion of participants in Fyans’s study
[7], we found that familiarity with the instrument had no
impact on audience interest or enjoyment of these perfor-
mances novel DMIs. However, the diﬀerence between con-
ventional and experimental musical styles had a signiﬁcant
impact on enjoyment. Further, this study found that audi-
ence listening habits had an eﬀect on experience, suggesting
204
that the context an audience brings with them plays a part
in how they experience the performance (though more study
of this is needed to make solid conclusions). Our qualitative
data further reinforces these conclusions, and raises inter-
esting possibilities of salience in performance, suggesting
that audiences may have remarkably consistent experiences
when observing performances (though, again, speciﬁc ex-
amination is needed).
Further, this study oﬀers insight into the limits of trans-
parency in DMI design [6], showing that insofar as trans-
parency is important to the audience experience, it can-
not be addressed simply by explaining the instrument. We
also emphasise that this study does not directly address
the question of whether an intuitively obvious relationship
between gesture and sound improves the audience experi-
ence. Gurevich and Fyans’s work comparing the theremin
and Tilt-Synth [9] provides some hints in that direction, but
further studies are needed to conﬁrm how transparency is
achieved and whether it has a meaningful eﬀect on audi-
ence enjoyment, and to understand the design choices that
support it. We also emphasise that although these eﬀects
appear signiﬁcant for this particular audience and these per-
formers, they may not extend uniformly to all performers
and all instruments.
Finally, our purpose in this study is not to suggest that
one musical style is “better” than another, or even to sug-
gest that self-reported audience enjoyment ought to be the
guiding factor in the DMI design process. Diﬀerent musical
works engage the audience in diﬀerent ways, and some of the
most profound music can also be the most challenging to lis-
ten to. We do, however, suggest that these ﬁndings provide
valuable insight into the audience experience of novel DMI
performance, and that time spent making the audience un-
derstand the technology is misplaced. Though many DMIs
are often tightly connected to the music they are used to
produce, there is value in considering which aspects of au-
dience experience are inﬂuenced by technology, and which
by aesthetic factors.
