ABSTRACT
In this paper, the authors describe the evaluation of a col-
lection of bespoke knob cap designs intended to improve
the ease in which a speciﬁc musician with dyskinetic cere-
bral palsy can operate rotary controls in a musical context.
The authors highlight the importance of the performer’s
perspective when using design as a means for overcoming
access barriers to music. Also, while the authors were not
able to ﬁnd an ideal solution for the musician within the con-
ﬁnes of this study, several useful observations on the pro-
cess of evaluating bespoke assistive music technology are
described; observations which may prove useful to digital
musical instrument designers working within the ﬁeld of in-
clusive music.

1. INTRODUCTION
Over recent years, there has been an increase in the de-
sign and fabrication of bespoke assistive music technologies
(AMTs), designed as a means for overcoming access barriers
to music performance and composition and, in part, facili-
tating inclusion in music. Access barriers can remain hid-
den from designers if they do not directly experience them,
which makes the validation of AMT designs through a ro-
bust evaluation process particularly important. In this pa-
per, the authors describe the evaluation of a seemingly sim-
ple solution to an access barrier faced by an individual with
cerebral palsy when operating rotary controls on commer-
cially available digital musical instruments (DMIs). The au-
thors discuss the ethical, social and practical considerations
which arose while working with the participant and con-
clude by reﬂecting on how this study will inform their future
practice.

2. DESIGNING FOR A SINGLE MUSICIAN
Commercial product designers, often encapsulate the goals,
behaviours and abilities of a broad target user-group into
a ﬁctional archetype known as a persona. The use of per-
sonas is widespread in the design of digital products and
services [6], including the design of DMIs. Personas feature
a name, demographic and a constructed narrative. In some
cases, stock imagery is used to bring life to these fabricated
characters. Personas are a useful tool, used by designers,
for keeping the requirements of the target user-group at the
forefront of their mind when making design decisions. Un-
fortunately, often the persona approach does not suitably
factor in any variance from ’atypical’ abilities in a user-
group. There are some eﬀorts to avoid the exclusion of
individual users in the design process, for example through
the use of diverse personas [1] in inclusive design practices
which aim to describe individuals living with certain condi-
tions. However, within the disabled community, even under
the same medical diagnosis, the lived experience of individ-
uals can vary considerably from person to person.
There is value in evaluating new DMI designs regardless of
whether they are intended to be used by a broad user-group
or by an individual. It is important to note however that
the goals of a DMI evaluation, the evaluation criteria and
the intended outcomes of the evaluation can vary consider-
ably depending on the nature of the design. For example,
one designer may be particularly interested in how a DMI
performs with a broad user-group in regard to Donald Nor-
man’s criteria for good design [11], that of visibility, good
conceptual model, good mappings and feedback. A qualita-
tive study with many participants may be applicable here.
Whereas a second DMI designer may be more interested in
the speed and accuracy in which it is possible to accomplish
a speciﬁc musical action, therefore a series of quantitative
tests may be a more appropriate means of evaluation. An
essential question to ask is from whose perspective is the
evaluation based, that of the performer, the designer or the
audience? The adage ‘Nothing About Us Without Us’, en-
capsulates the idea that people with disabilities know what
is best for themselves and their communities [2], a philoso-
phy that also extends to the design of AMTs. Musical per-
formance is an action that aims to be a conduit of individual
expression, therefore it is understandable that more often
than not the performer’s insight is sought in DMI evalua-
tion [9]. The apparent value of the performer’s perspective
serves to increase further the importance of involving users
of bespoke AMT in the evaluation process.
3. AN EVOLUTION OF THE KNOB CAP
In order to operate a rotary potentiometer, such as those
featured on Novation’s Launchkey range of MIDI controller
105
keyboards1, the user will typically pinch the knob cap be-
tween their thumb and index ﬁnger of one hand and roll
the knob cap a short distance across the ﬁnger and thumb
respectively. Also, there will often be some degree of wrist
movement, either ulnar ﬂexion or radial ﬂexion [3], depend-
ing on the direction of rotation. For the remainder of this
paper, the term pinch-roll is used to describe the typical
actions involved in operating a rotary potentiometer.
The actions of moving ones hand to the position of a small
control, extending speciﬁc ﬁngers, pinching with appropri-
ate force, moving ﬁngers in a controlled manner and ﬂexing
the wrist can be challenging for individuals with impaired
motor control. Placing these actions in a musical context
adds complexity. The user may be executing other actions
in tandem, for example, playing keys or may face the added
pressure of completing time-based actions such as that of
changing a parameter to a target value before the end of a
musical section. There are of course ways to work around
the access barriers some individuals face when controlling
musical parameters with rotary potentiometers. One solu-
tion is the application of an alternative control modality.
Faders (i.e. sliding potentiometers) that feature a DJ-style
raised cap, while also typically pinched between the thumb
and index ﬁnger when being operated, support pushing and
pulling actions which, in comparison to the pinch-roll ac-
tion can be more eﬃciently executed by other parts of the
hand or indeed other body parts. Rotary potentiometers
are ubiquitous in commercial music technology devices, of-
ten used as the primary control modality for parameters
which are not MIDI assignable, for example, menu naviga-
tion and conﬁguration, or sound-sculpting parameters on
analogue synthesisers, therefore remaining inaccessible to
some. There is value in exploring adaptive techniques for
improving rotary control accessibility.
The authors’ original intentions for this study were, through
the application of an action research methodology, to pro-
vide a particular individual with a disability with improved
access to rotary potentiometers in a musical context. Be-
spoke design is a viable option for tackling access barriers
faced on an individual level due to the complex and unique
manner in which disabilities can present themselves. As
part of the ethical considerations of this study, any accessi-
bility improvements needed to apply to equipment available
to the participant. Furthermore, it was deemed that at the
end of the study, the participant must be provided with any
solutions deemed to improve access.
3.1 Participant Background Information
The participant is male, thirty-six years of years of age and
has been composing and performing music with the inclu-
sive music organisation, the Drake Music Project Northern
Ireland (DMNI) for approximately twenty-ﬁve years. The
primary author of this paper has been supporting the par-
ticipant at weekly DMNI music workshops, in the capacity
of an Access Music Tutor for approximately twelve months.
Out of all of the mainstream and assistive music technology
devices available for use through DMNI, the participant’s
preference is mainstream MIDI keyboard controllers. The
participant has access to a Novation Launchkey 61 MkII
MIDI controller keyboard at DMNI music workshops; the
study, therefore, focused on this device. The participant
has dyskinetic cerebral palsy, a condition which aﬀects as-
pects of motor control skills and expressive language capa-
bilities [10]. The participant often experiences involuntary
movements when attempting to move in a controlled man-
ner which makes it challenging for the participant to target
1https://novationmusic.com/keys/launchkey
physical objects with his upper limbs. Due to low/weak
muscle tone, the participant experiences stiﬀness and re-
sistance to movement in his hands and ﬁngers, resulting
in considerable diﬃculty executing the pinch-roll action.
Rotary potentiometers are not currently a viable control
modality for the participant. Therefore, when presented
with the task of manipulating a continuous musical param-
eter during a workshop, a MIDI-assignable DJ-style fader
is typically used. While research suggests that there is no
performative diﬀerence between sliding and rotary poten-
tiometers [4], personal preferences do exist. For example, it
may seem alien to some to control a parameter such as audio
signal panning on a sliding potentiometer. Both the partic-
ipant and the authors had a desire to expand the number
of control modalities available to the participant to include
rotary potentiometers.
3.2 Design Goals
There were two primary design goals: 1) To improve the
ease in which the participant can rotate the rotary poten-
tiometers of the Launchkey, 2) To improve the ease in which
the participant can target these controls.
By way of physical attributes, the Launchkey features
a row of eight rotary potentiometers spaced 23mm apart
(centre to centre). These controls feature a 6mm D-shaped
shaft. End stops constrain rotation at approximately ﬁve
and seven o’clock.
3.3 Alternative Designs
Figure 1: Alternative designs fabricated from PLA
plastic ﬁlament alongside the original knob cap.
Through the successful use of faders, the participant has
previously demonstrated that both push and pull actions
are achievable. Modiﬁcations to the design of the original
knob cap can provide aﬀordances that support these alter-
native actions. Fitts’s Law is an empirical model which de-
scribes the trade-oﬀs between speed and accuracy in human
muscle movements [5]. According to the Index of Diﬃculty
described in Fitts’s Law, in addition to the distance the par-
ticipant’s hand is required to travel, the size of the knob cap
is likely to be a factor in how easy it is for the participant
to target.
The study proceeded based on the hypothesis that push
and pull actions are a viable way to operate a rotary poten-
tiometer and that larger knob caps, will be easier to target.

Figure 2: Original Knob Cap Alongside Alternative
Designs.
In preparation for the evaluation phase of this study, the fol-
lowing three alternative designs were fabricated from poly-
lactic acid (PLA) plastic ﬁlament using a 3D printer, shown
alongside the original knob cap (Design 1) in Figure 1.
3.3.1 Design 1: The Original Knob Cap
The original knob cap features a ﬂange at the base of 16mm
in diameter. At the top of the knob cap, the diameter is
much smaller at just 9mm. A white, positional pointer pro-
trudes from the side of the knob cap. A rubber material
covers the knob cap providing the user with additional grip.
3.3.2 Design 2: Constrained Tri-Blade
The introduction of three blades in this design aims to pro-
vide the user with contact points which can be pushed or
pulled by a single ﬁnger. Design 2 is ’constrained’ in size
to allow use on adjacent controls of the Launchkey without
the blades touching each other.
3.3.3 Design 3: Overlapped Tri-Blade
Design 3 consists of two knob caps (3a and 3b), each with
three blades extended in length in comparison to Design 2.
The blades of these two knob caps are designed to overlap
one-another upon rotation.
3.3.4 Design 4: Keyed Tri-Blade
Design 4 consists of two parts: a modiﬁed knob cap (4a)
and a key (4b). The intention of this design was for the
user to ﬁt the key to the control they would like to operate.
As the key is not a permanent ﬁxture, it is viable for the
blades to extend over adjacent controls. The knob cap and
key each feature an embedded magnet which assists in their
connection.
3.4 Evaluation
It was in planning the evaluation of the knob cap designs
that the authors began to gain an insight into the chal-
lenges of evaluation in the context of bespoke AMT. Often
one of the ﬁrst questions asked in any study is whether to
test the hypothesis by qualitative or quantitative means. As
discussed earlier, the performer’s perspective was perhaps,
above all else, the most important perspective to under-
stand, regarding the eﬀectiveness of each design, this ob-
servation suggested to the authors that a qualitative study
would be appropriate. A common approach for gathering
insight into an individual’s perspective is through the use
of semi-structured interviews; historically, researchers have
excluded participants with expressive language impairments
from such studies [8]. The authors were keen not to rule
out such an approach but as the participant does not use
any communication aids, the authors needed to be vigilant
in ensuring they did not misunderstand and therefore mis-
represent the views of the participant. A quantitative ap-
proach to evaluation also presents challenges in this context.
When designing for a broad user-group, one can obtain use-
ful quantitative data from task-based evaluations with mul-
tiple participants. The alternative knob cap designs are
intended to overcome unique access barriers faced by an
individual. For this study it would not have been overly
useful to test the designs with other participants. Also, the
authors were mindful of participant fatigue and therefore
factored this into the evaluation of the knob caps by lim-
iting the overall number of tasks. Due to time constraints
and the availability of the participant, it was not possible
to run multiple tests; therefore the quantity of quantitative
data collected for this study was limited.
In order to adequately evaluate the alternative knob cap
designs, it was vital to test them in context. A peculiarity
of musical tasks is that not only do they need to be executed
with accuracy, often tasks are temporal due to the consider-
ation of musical timing and rhythm [12]. Commonly used in
HCI quantitative evaluation, Fitts’s Law also has relevance
in the assessment of DMIs, particularly in a temporal con-
text. Limited research exists regarding the applicability of
Fitts’s Law in movement studies with individuals with cere-
bral palsy. However, a 2002 study conducted with a group
of eight individuals with cerebral palsy suggested that the
movement times of the individuals in this group did not
conform to Fitts’s Law [7]. A secondary consideration is
the relevance of strict musical timing in this context. Often
in music workshops at DMNI the participant is provided
with support to allow him to play musical passages in-time.
The use of MIDI quantisation and arpeggiators were factors
considered when devising the context in which to test the
knob cap designs. Bearing in mind the considerations listed
above, the authors decided to follow a holistic approach in
the evaluation of the knob cap designs as described below.
3.4.1 Scenario
A fabricated musical scenario, based on activities the par-
ticipant might typically be engaged in during a music work-
shop, provided a context for the evaluation. The participant
was asked to perform a series of tasks, based mainly upon
control rotation. The knob caps under test were placed on
the two rotary potentiometers to the far left of the bank
of eight on the Launchkey, in Position 1 and Position 2 .
This placement allowed, each knob cap design to be tested
with adjacent controls either side and with just one control
to the right of the control under test. Video footage of the
test session was recorded for later analysis along with MIDI
CC data from the two controls for each task performed. The
Launchkey was conﬁgured to control a monophonic virtual
software-based instrument. The virtual instrument played
a latched arpeggiated pattern based on input from the key-
board of the Launchkey removing the requirement for the
participant to press and hold keys while operating the con-
trols. The two controls under test were assigned to the Fil-
ter 1 Frequency and Filter 2 Frequency parameters of the
virtual instrument.
3.4.2 Tasks
The participant was asked to perform the following tasks
with each knob cap design, placed on controls in Position 1
107
and Position 2 of the Launchkey, amounting to forty tasks:
1. Rotate the control from fully anti-clockwise to fully
clockwise.
2. Rotate the control from fully clockwise to fully anti-
clockwise.
3. Rotate the control from fully anti-clockwise to its cen-
tral position.
4. Rotate the control from fully clockwise to its central
position.
A series of additional tasks were planned to ascertain the
ease in which the participant could move the the key of
design 4 (4b) between the two controls.
1. Move the key from Position 1 to Position 2. Each
control is set to its fully anti-clockwise position.
2. Move the key from Position 2 to Position 1. Each
control is set to its fully anti-clockwise position.
These tasks were stopped early due to the obvious chal-
lenging access barrier presented to the participant. There-
fore the authors have decided to only document the ﬁrst
four tasks.
3.4.3 Difﬁculty of Use Criteria
Before beginning the evaluation, the authors devised a list
containing criteria that, if met would indicate the partici-
pant is having diﬃculty operating the control.
1. The participant inadvertently operates a diﬀerent con-
trol.
2. The participant cannot rotate the control.
3. The participant cannot set the control to the target
position.
4. There are pauses in the operation of the control (i.e.
none smooth operation).
5. The participant moves the control in a direction op-
posite to that intended.
6. The knob cap becomes detached from the control.
In addition to the criteria above, the primary author had
a conversation with the participant where he was asked to
provide his subjective opinion on which knob cap design he
found most comfortable to operate.
3.5 Observations
Figure 3: A depiction of the MIDI data recorded
during Task 2.
3.5.1 Quantitative Results
Task 2 involved the participant rotating the control in Po-
sition 2 from a fully anti-clockwise position to a fully clock-
wise position with each knob cap design. It is clear, from
examining the captured MIDI data displayed in Figure 3,
that a number of the Diﬃculty of Use Criteria are present
for all four designs, indicating that participant was expe-
riencing diﬃculty in operating the controls with ease. For
example, it is apparent that for each design the participant
had diﬃculty not inadvertently changing the value of the
control in Position 1. During Task 2, the control in Position
2 reached the target destination on only one occasion, when
Design 4 was under test. Figure 4, provides an overview of
how often each design met the Diﬃculty of Use Criteria.
Although a somewhat limited amount of data, some pro-
visional observations can be made through examination of
Figure 4, as listed below.
1. Use of blades on a knob cap increase the likelihood
that the participant will be able to rotate the control.
2. Knob cap blades increase the likelihood of there being
pauses in control data when being operated by the
participant.
3. The larger the knob cap blade, the greater the like-
lihood of the participant operating the control in the
opposite direction to that intended.

Use Criteria were present for each design.
3.5.2 Qualitative Results
The primary author was able to make the following observa-
tions, from a designers perspective, after observing the par-
ticipant during the evaluation session. First, the primary
author gained a clear understanding how the participant
operates rotary potentiometers with regular knob caps. In
the evaluation session, the participant would typically po-
sition the index ﬁnger of his left-hand perpendicular to the
top surface of the Launchkey and then proceed to roll the
side of his ﬁnger around the side of the knob cap, starting at
the side furthest from him, pulling his ﬁnger back towards
himself. The participant essentially performs the roll of the
pinch-roll action in isolation. At times, the participant ex-
tended the other ﬁngers of his left hand which resulted in
the inadvertent operation of adjacent controls. The rub-
ber coating of the original knob cap (Design 1) provides
additional grip, a physical attribute which the participant
beneﬁted from when operating the controls in the manner
108
described above. Rotations were often performed in stages
as the participant would need to reposition his ﬁnger several
times to rotate a control across its entire travel.
The participant demonstrated that the blades present in
the alternative designs did indeed provide aﬀordances which
supported push and pull actions. However, the height of the
blades and the position of the control under test appeared
to add signiﬁcant factors in how easy it was for the partici-
pant to operate the control. Design 3b with its low blades,
embedded between two controls was challenging for the par-
ticipant to operate due to there being little room between
adjacent knob caps for the participant to navigate his index
ﬁnger between, particularly when the blades of Design 3a
were obstructing the path of the participant’s ﬁnger.
When using the alternative designs, it was clear that the
participant still needed to operate the control in stages to
perform a full rotation across its entire range. On occasion,
the blades appeared to impede the participant’s ability to
reposition his ﬁnger during a control operation; the partic-
ipant was required to lift his ﬁnger over at least one blade
to reach a comfortable position to start the next stage of
rotation.
The primary author observed conformity to the Index of
Diﬃculty described in Fitts’s Law as the largest of the knob
caps (Design 4) appeared to be more comfortable for the
participant to target. However, a signiﬁcant issue occurred
with this design; the key became detached from the control
on two occasions during the test.
With regards to the performer’s perspective, the primary
author asked the participant for his subjective opinion on
which design he found most comfortable to use. At the
end of the evaluation session, using multiple choice response
methods, the participant indicated that he found Design 4
most comfortable to use. The tests progressed in numerical
order of design, from 1-4. During the evaluation session,
the participant indicated that each design was progressively
easier than the last to operate, suggesting that an increased
size in knob cap improved ease of use.
On an aside, a secondary access barrier presented itself
when using the Launchkey in this context. In order to
reach the rotary controls of the Launchkey, the participant
is required to extend his arm forward. The participant’s
forearm has a somewhat ﬁxed position. The keys of the
Launchkey were inadvertently pressed by the participant’s
forearm when operating the rotary controls. The Launchkey
was placed on a wheelchair accessible table and therefore po-
sitioned quite high from the ﬂoor during the evaluation. Use
of a height adjustable keyboard stand, suited to the dimen-
sions of the participant’s wheelchair might help to overcome
this secondary access barrier in future evaluations.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, the authors described the challenges of eval-
uating bespoke assistive music technology designed for a
musician with dyskinetic cerebral palsy. The authors ex-
perimented with a holistic approach to the evaluation of
a series of knob caps designed as a means of overcoming
the unique access barriers faced by this musician. Quanti-
tative data and qualitative observations, coupled with the
views of the participant, helped to paint a picture as to
the eﬀectiveness of each knob cap design regarding improv-
ing the ease of operation of rotary controls. At this ini-
tial stage of the design, the authors have shown that larger
knob caps improved the ease at which the participant could
target controls. However, through analysing the knob cap
designs against the Diﬃculty of Use Criteria devised by the
authors, they cannot conclusively say that one design was
easier for the participant to operate than another. This
work will inform the next stage of designing and testing,
to be carried out in February - March 2019. At the begin-
ning of this paper, observations made by Barbosa et al. [9]
coupled with philosophical views of inclusion held by the
disabled community represented by the adage of Nothing
About Us Without Us [2], the authors noted the impor-
tance of the performer’s perspective in a study of this kind.
The participant provided such a perspective in this study.
The authors would beneﬁt from discussing further with the
performer his preference for Design 4 as this would help to
inform future iterations of the design. The authors made
some progress toward their original design goals but have
not yet completed this journey.
