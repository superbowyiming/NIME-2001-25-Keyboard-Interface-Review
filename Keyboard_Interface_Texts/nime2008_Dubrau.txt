ABSTRACT
P[a]ra[pra]xis is an open two-part software suite and Java library 
(JAR) that facilitates the realtime creation and simultaneous 
sonification of poetry/prose. It is particularly designed to 
implement word substitutions based on the psychoanalytical 
principles of free association and metonymic slippage.  
The first part, P[a]ra[pra]xis Collection Editor, allows a user to 
create and maintain a dictionary of words and their grammatical 
properties (i.e. verb, singular noun, pronoun e tc.) and the 
corresponding properties of user-defined substitutions for those 
words. The second part, Realtime P[a]ra[pra]xis, executes these 
substitutions as the user/performer types, and broadcasts OSC 
messages containing the properties of the original and substituted 
words, along with discrete notifications of keyboard events. 
A case study (based on a live networked performance) is 
presented which highlights one particular usage of this program in 
the form of an Instant Messenger (IM) style chat with interpolated 
‘Freudian slips’ to create a dialogue which changes between the 
point of transmission and the point of reception, and 
spontaneously generates music reflecting physical and emotional 
changes in the dialogue.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Text-to-sound converters are not uncommon. Realtime music 
software like pd, Csound and SuperCollider can receive discrete 
keyboard events when a key is typed. Other software maps text (as 
ASCII characters) either to MIDI note numbers or to an MP3 file, 
invariably based on transmogrifications of alphabet positioning to 
pitch, texture or rhythm. More advanced converters create meta-
descriptors (which may be based on a readability index, or some 
other lingual parser) which are then used to control musical 
parameters. Please see [1] for an extensive listing and discussion 
of software. 
At the other e nd of the spectrum, sonification mechanisms have 
been developed that can be linked to specialist language systems. 
SoniPy[2] is an open framework for sonification written in 
Python, and can therefore be linked to the Natural Language 
Toolkit (NLTK) [3]. In turn, NLTK can import data and functions 
from Wordnet  –  a dictionary and development toolkit in which 
“[n]ouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of 
cognitive synonyms, each expressing a distinct concept” [4]. 
 Words are treated (and encapsulated) as objects, with properties 
and relationships to other words that can be evaluated and used in 
realtime; it becomes possible to sonify text as whole words, using 
well-defined relationships between different words, rather than 
sonifying text as characters or keyboard e vents alone. However, 
this raw power delivers us a ‘blank-slate’ problem: how do we 
create an appropriate framework for this linguistic data? How do 
we incorporate these e xtra dimensions of words into a Human 
Computer Interface (HCI)? Use them as a creative tool that can be 
meaningfully integrated with music? 
Magnusson [5] presents a useful discussion in which designing 
music software is framed as a semiotic act, “structur[ing] a system 
of signs into a coherent whole that incorporates some 
compositional ideology (or an effort to exclude it)”. He draws a 
distinction between traditional HCI design (representational and 
task-based, often imitating real-world tasks in order to prepare 
and organise information) and the type of design that uses the 
computer for artistic creation. The distinction between the two, 
however, is problematic. Magnusson argues that whilst a user 
engaged in creative practice “deploy[s] software to achieve some 
end goals...this very software is also a system of representational 
meanings, thus influencing and coercing the artist into certain 
work patterns.” This is as true for the most permissive musical 
software as it is for the most restrictive, seen in the user 
modifications (such as GUI e xtensions and sliders) created even 
for such flexible programs as pd. 
In the case of text to music converters, software at both ends of 
the spectrum remains creatively restrictive despite program 
sophistication and flexibility. The NLTK, for e xample, has the 
ability to track words along multiple axes (synonym, homonym, 
antonym e tc.) yet it still treats words only as raw data; music 
produced through a linkage to the NLTK that is not based on a 
structured relationship between the performer, language and 
sound can harness no more of the power of language than an 
ASCII conversion. In a creative e nvironment increasingly rich 
with collaborative and multi-modal performances, there e xists a 
gap, a loss of meaning in the translation of text to sound. 
Common performance techniques include: poetry performance 
with sonification designed and improvised in response to the 
performed poetry in real time or the previously mentioned ASCII 
conversion of typed text, perhaps with extra manipulation [6]. In 
many performances which use data to generate sound, the source 
of the data, or its potential ‘meaning’ is often considered largely 
irrelevant. However, where text is employed as the data source it 
is mostly on display in some form, whether auditory or visual. 
This would seem to imply that the text/sound relationship has a

certain importance, which may not be fully realised in current 
processes of sound generation. 
2. P[A]RA[PRA]XIS: A SEMI[ER]OTIC 
MACHINE 
P[a]ra[pra]xis provides a platform for the performer (or 
musician, or writer) to sculpt a personally meaningful system of 
linguistic substitution within a self-created text.  Although the 
P[a]ra[pra]xis S uite software is applicable to any project 
involving the sonification of data gathered from lingual 
substitutions, it was created with a particular direction in mind. 
The term ‘Parapraxis’ emerged as an English translation for what 
Freud termed die F ehlleistung, literally, ‘faulty action’, used to 
describe the unintentional miscommunication occurring during 
even the most banal of daily human interactions [7]. It 
encompasses the range of mistaken perceptions, actions or speech 
which occur when the subconscious and the conscious mind, as is 
generally the case, are working to non-aligned agendas, and is 
commonly known as the Freudian slip, where you may ‘say one 
thing but mean your mother’. Needless to say, its motives are 
often classed as sexual. 
The unique combinations of words and concepts which parapraxis 
creates also lend an additional flexibility to grammatical norms. 
Whereas Freud’s ‘parapraxis’ is e ither a singular instance or a 
genre-descriptor of such an error and constitutes that which is a 
kind of ‘sub-normal activity’ in relation to the business of 
perception and communication, our version, P[a]ra[pra]xis, 
conflates the nuance of ‘para’ meaning ‘beyond’, or ‘outside of’ 
with the academic notion of ‘praxis’ as theory put into action: 
thus it comes to describe an e ntire way of creatively e xploring 
language and music through the building of user-initiated 
dictionaries based on free association and metonymic slippage [8].  
In the early 1900s, the Swiss linguist, Ferdinand de Saussure, was 
responsible for the development of a linguistic apparatus which 
re-defined the focus of the relationship between words and the 
ways in which meanings become attached to them. Saussure 
claimed the linguistic sign as “a two-sided psychological entity”, 
consisting only of “a concept which e xists in e quilibrial 
relationship with a sound pattern” [9]. 
Figure 1. de Saussure’s diagram, demonstrating the 
relationship between concept and sound pattern 
In one of Saussure’s most well-known diagrams (See Figure 1. 
above) the concept is designated by a word which ‘stands in for’ 
an actual physical object. The ‘word’ tree (or arbor, in Saussure’s 
native tongue) has nothing to do with either the image it conjures 
up, or the physical reality of a tree. This idea, that sign and 
signified have no innate connection, has played out in many 
different guises over the course of the last hundred odd years, 
beginning with e arly modernism, and culminating in multiple 
instances of user-created semiotic systems, where any sign may be 
attached to any signifier, as long as the relationship is pre-
determined. In the paper previously mentioned, Magnusson sees 
that “actors and the contexts in which they function are all 
elements in a semiotic language…W e provide a semiotics or 
suggest language games where the behaviour of an actor maps 
onto some parameters in a sound e ngine.  For e xample, vertical 
location of an actor could signify the pitch of a tone or playback 
rate of a sample”[5].  
In taking on Saussure’s notion that ‘the link between signal and 
signification is arbitrary’, many conceptual versions of semiotic 
systems fail to take a key factor into account: much of the power 
of language arises precisely because of the false innate meaning 
we ascribe to individual words. P[a]ra[pra]xis aims to utilise this 
power by involving the performer/user in a tension between 
emotional or psychic resonances which may be attached to 
particular word significations and the implementation of a rule-set 
which can make what may at first appear to be extremely radical 
changes to the associations between words as we generally use 
them.  
This returns us to Freud’s investigation of the hidden associations 
lurking in e very Parapraxis; P[a]ra[pra]xis works to open up 
these associations in several ways. Firstly, a user involved in 
entering or modifying words for the dictionary file is free to 
explore their own mental links between sounds, text and ideas. 
When dealing with the word ‘box’, one man’s ‘bo[ra]x’ may be 
another man’s ‘b[ot]ox’. When playing P[a]ra[pra]xis in real-
time, users will be forced to respond to lingual substitutions 
determined by a dynamic, but grammatically oriented rule-set. A 
player writing a poem or story will be subjected to a continually 
altering narrative, and will thus involuntarily form new chains of 
signification, by e ither e ngaging or refusing to e ngage with the 
material presented. 
3. THE P[A]RA[PRA]XIS SOFTWARE 
SUITE 
The language substitutions that occur when a performer enters a 
dictionary word in the P[a]ra[pra]xis set are predicated on six 
linguistic conditions: anagram; phonetic substitution; predictive; 
additive; subtractive; midrash. For a more detailed outline, please 
see [10]. The P[a]ra[pra]xis S oftware S uite includes two 
applications which together e nable the creation of and 
implementation of the word substitution process described above. 
P[a]ra[pra]xis Collection Editor is a straightforward Java 
application which manages the relationships between words and 
their possible substitutions. Realtime P[a]ra[pra]xis is also a Java 
application; it handles the realtime implementation of rules 
designed within it on a dictionary file created in the Collection 
Editor. Here, a rule describes the conditions that must be met for a 
word to be substituted by another word. 
A typed word is only replaced if two conditions are met: the typed 
word exists as an ‘original’ word in the dictionary; and the typed

165
word has at least one substitution that meets the conditions of a 
rule. For e xample, if the rule stipulates that nouns can only be 
replaced with other nouns, and the typed word is a noun but none 
of its possible replacements are nouns, no substitution is made. 
Figure 2. shows how a set of possible substitutions are filtered 
into a set of legal substitutions. 
Figure 2. A screenshot from Realtime P[a]ra[pra]xis. A user 
has just typed ‘I’ve been on the net, trawling’ when ‘trawling’ 
is found to have possible word substitutions, shown in the ‘All 
P[a]ra[pra]xes’ column. The rule here, however, only allows 
present-tense verbs to be replaced with a word that is either an 
adjective or a past-/present-tense verb. Further, this rule only 
permits a phonetic substitution, disallowing ‘[ex]tra[]w[il]ling’ 
as a possible substitution. 
Realtime Parapraxis broadcasts on four different OSC address 
patterns which, interpreted together, give an external application 
insight across the continuum of a performer’s input: 
1) /k ey (Integer): the ASCII code for each key typed; 
2) /word  (String): a String that contains the last word 
typed. This is sent whenever a non-alphanumeric 
character is typed and the system assumes a word has 
been completed, but this word is not found in the 
original word list in the dictionary; 
3) /knownWord  (String): a String that contains the last 
word typed if that word appears in the dictionary’s
original word list - whether or not the word has been 
substituted - followed by a list containing that word’s 
properties; and 
4) /r eplacement (String):  a String that contains the word 
that replaced the last word typed only if a legal 
substation was made, followed by a list containing that 
replacement word’s properties. 
Figure 3. shows the OSC output as received in pd.  
Further, Parapraxis Collection Editor allows users to create their 
own word/replacement descriptors as well as the standard 
properties. These are appended sequentially to the list broadcast 
on the /knownWord and /replacement address patterns1. 
Figure 3. Pd receives information regarding the performer’s 
input in realtime. Key presses, unknown words, known words 
and (when applicable) replacement words are broadcast, along 
with their properties. 
As well as the two Java applications, we are making a Java library 
(JAR file) available which provides all the functionality for 
P[a]ra[pra]xis. This library can be used to develop custom 
graphical interfaces as well as manipulating word and word 
substitution relationships in a unique way and from the ground 
up.  
4. CASE STUDY 
Po[or S ymm]etry [ Dra]in[s] [ E]motion[s] is a live networked 
performance piece developed with P[a]ra[pra]xis software and 
implemented using the JAR library and a custom GUI. It should 
be stressed that this description is not prescriptive; lyrical and 
musical decisions are entirely decoupled from the core software. 
The work presents an Instant Messenger (IM)-like conversation 
between two people, in an obviously troubled relationship. Both 
screens are presented separately to the audience. 
As performer A begins to type, the text is displayed unadulterated 
on their screen. When they click ‘send’, however, the text briefly 
appears in its original form on performer B’s screen before being 
‘re-written’, converted on screen as though it were being typed. 
Figure 4 shows part of this conversation.  
The dictionary for this piece consists of about 160 words; there 
are currently 370 possible substitutions which can be made. Even 
if the performers have worked with the piece before, there will 
still be linguistic surprises.  
The piece presents both an auditory and a visual rendering of the 
ways in the ‘meaning’ of language shifts: from ‘speaker’ to 
                                                                
1 Whilst the default OSC output is a space-separated string that 
contains a word’s properties, the software can also output a list 
of Boolean states that may be more e asily interpreted in 
different music software.

‘hearer’ and from the utilitarian meanings we ascribe to words for 
the sake of shared communication to the metonymic resonances 
(often unwelcome) which are e ngendered in the unconscious 
mind.   
Figure 4. Screen shots of the IM performance. Each person 
sees the original text they type whilst only seeing the altered 
version of the other person’s text. 
Because the text is re-written in realtime on the other person’s 
screen, (typically animated at around 25 mSec/character), the 
performance develops its own pace. Also, a visual counterpoint 
develops between the two screens, as the square brackets make 
substituted sections appear especially dense. 
The music is generated by interpreting a number of performance 
artefacts. Based on a set of e ndless glissandi [Risset], their 
relative base frequencies and speed are continually modified as a 
counterpoint to the tension in the dialogue. Specific factors 
controlling musical parameters are: average time between 
keystrokes; sentence length; phrase length (how much a person 
types before pressing the ‘send’ button); and type of substitution. 
Interpreting the type of substitution is especially powerful. Whilst 
most of the substitutions are midrashes and use square brackets, 
phonetic substitutions and anagrams provide visual relief as well 
as prompting a different kind of intellectual reaction from an 
audience. The music-generating algorithm uses these to structure 
the relationships between glissandi in a fugal counterpoint, and 
signaling the start of a new invocation of the cantus firmus, or 
principle melodic line.  
As the performer/musician/writer has complete control not only 
over the possible substitutions created for dictionary words, but 
also over the framework in which to define their relationships, it 
is very easy to generate audio output which maps the emotionality 
of the piece through changes in the text. 
5. CONCLUSION 
The development of this P[a]ra[pra]xis software suite marks a 
milestone in a continually e volving and e xpanding project. 
Starting from the simple shared idea of a basic real-time 
interactive poetry generator, we have been drawn to grammar, 
linguistics, psychoanalytical theory and serial, e lectronic 
composition as tools to investigate the human relationship to 
language. 
P[a]ra[pra]xis marks a collaboration between two authors from 
divergent backgrounds within the Creative Arts field; Poetry and 
Sonic Arts. In order to make P[a]ra[pra]xis a genuine 
collaboration, not just an outsourcing of difficult specialist tasks, 
we have had to adjust and develop our perceptions of our own and 
each others’ language, just as those who play P[a]ra[pra]xis will. 
Hopefully others will find this as beneficial as we have.
