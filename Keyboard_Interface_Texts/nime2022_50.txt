ABSTRACT
This paper describes the 10,000 Instruments workshop, a collaborative online event 
conceived to generate interface ideas and speculate on music technology through open-
ended artefacts and playful design explorations. We first present the activity, setting its 
research and artistic scope. We then report on a selection of outcomes created by 
workshop attendees, and examine the critical design statements they convey. The 
paper concludes with reflections on the make-believe, whimsical and troublemaking 
approach to instrument design adopted in the workshop. In particular, we consider the 
ways this activity can support individuals' creativity, unlock shared musical visions and 
reveal unconventional perspectives on music technology development.

Introduction
Music technologists embrace a variety of approaches and mindsets: alongside 
specialised technical investigations, researchers cultivate holistic and critical 
attitudes. Examples of such work include investigations on gender and class [1], 
inquiries on ethics and inclusion [2] [3] as well as discussions on the diversity of 
methods and contributions [4].
These critical takes often aim to problematise prevailing views on technological 
innovation and academic contributions, setting forth alternative discourses and 
practices which, rather than appealing to ‘the new’, question what is today assumed as 
worthwhile and relevant research [5]. In line with this ethos, we describe a provocative 
approach to music technology ideation: a generative and open-ended task which 
facilitates the emergence of critical positions as well as unconventional visions of 
future musical interfaces and instruments.
This article describes the 10,000 Instruments workshop, a permissive, fast-paced and 
cheerful exercise where practitioners are invited to sketch as many instrument ideas

as possible in a limited amount of time. The activity has been developed around the 
limitations of running a workshop during a pandemic and allows the  participants to 
speculate on musical instruments and their socio-cultural contexts in an online 
collaborative setting. The workshop outcomes were then collected in a public document
 following the logic of annotated portfolios [6][7].
We first outline the activity, introducing its structure and main elements. We then 
provide an overview on how, while sketching unfamiliar and incongruous musical 
instruments, practitioners were able to exploit humour and make-believe as devices for 
the generation of critical reflections. Finally, we discuss our workshop focusing on 
some of its practical implications.  
Background
Within the domain of musical interactions, it is possible to identify a small but growing 
body of research that challenges technology ideation and development through absurd 
and playful artefacts. These include the work of John Bowers and Owen Green which 
exploited the notion of ‘hijacking’ as a way to question existing music technologies, 
their customary range of application and the implicit norms of musicality codified into 
the artefacts [8]. 
Another source of inspiration is the Absurd Music Hackathon described by Lepri et al. 
[9], in which the making of intentionally silly, absurd and provocative instruments 
allowed participants to generate a critique of current technology and illustrate future 
musical visions. The research introduced in this article is also indebted with the Magic 
Machines workshops developed by Kristina Andersen: a set of strategies aiming to 
expose personal design knowledge through the making of ‘not-yet existing’ artefacts 
[10]. 
In particular, we borrow from these works the idea of employing play and humour as 
means for the emergence of critical and unconventional design statements which can 
be shared and jointly expanded. Following Andersen’s insight, fictional objects function 
as “anchoring points for conversation and discovery” [10] and allow researchers to 
access subjective narratives, desires and priorities as well as shared assumptions and 
predominant views towards present and future technologies. 
In HCI (Human Computer Interaction) research absurd and questionable strategies are 
often exploited to support the generation of new design knowledge. Vines et al. 
facilitated participatory design workshops by exploiting the notion of questionable 
design concepts [11], to help participants reveal personal views, provide design

suggestions and reflections or articulate rejection statements. More recently, Laura 
Devendorf and colleagues questioned the assumptions and expectations that qualify a 
conventional HCI contribution by exploring what a “non-contribution” could look like 
[12]. Often mentioned in HCI contexts is the Japanese art of Chindōgu [13], where a 
designer produces “un-useless” objects which are, from a practical point of view, 
(almost) completely useless [14].  
Inspired by the above research, we adopted a permissive and playful mindset in our 
exercise to allow for the emergence of unconventional and critical design thinking 
[15]. In the following pages, we discuss the generative qualities of such an approach, 
examining how the many concepts co-developed during the activity allowed for the 
manifestation of highly diversified NIME accounts.
10,000 Instruments Workshop
The 10,000 Instruments workshop took place at NIME 2020 in the form of an online 
gathering during which conference attendees could collaborate to sketch musical 
instrument ideas. We introduced the activity as a playful, permissive and lighthearted 
event concerned with the creation of seriously silly concepts  [13], not-yet existing 
designs [10] and absurd variations of existing instruments [9]. Although the workshop 
had been originally conceived as an hands-on group activity to be held at the Royal 
Birmingham Conservatoire, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the online migration of 
the conference, we adapted our plans in order to accommodate the new event format. 
The workshop were presented to the NIME 2020 participants as follows:
“The 10.000 Instruments workshop aims to cheer up social distancing through 
some playful interactions. We invite the NIME community to dive in an online 
gathering to collaboratively sketch as many instrument ideas as possible. A 
lighthearted activity that might ease for a couple of hours the challenging 
situations we are all experiencing. An opportunity to experiment with alternative 
ways to generate interface ideas and speculate on music tech through open-ended 
artefacts and playful design explorations. An unconventional workshop to advance 
the debate around the complex, interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of 
contemporary musical instruments.” 1 
In view of the conference virtual venue and modalities, we decided to emphasise the 
creative and cheerful elements of the activity. Our ambition was then to propose a 
pleasant and entertaining workshop which could also provide some further hints to 
investigate absurd making in music technology contexts.

Workshop facilitation
Once the workshop was accepted, we opened the subscription to the conference 
attendees, setting a limit to a maximum number of 30 participants. Interested 
participants were invited to send an idea for an impractical and not-yet-existing 
musical design. These ideas have been used to feed a random generator of absurd 
instruments to be (ab)used during the workshop as a source of inspiration 2. The 
activity was then introduced to the signed-in participants as an online collaborative 
workshop with the aim to sketch as many instrument ideas as possible over the course 
of two hours - hence the impossible task of ideating 10,000 musical interfaces. We 
decided to use Google Slides as a shared workspace for collecting and developing the 
instrument ideas 3. 
We invited participants to create absurd instruments using any means they felt 
comfortable with, as far as the results could be documented and shared online - 
including (but not limited to) searching, copying and pasting images or hyperlinks 
from the internet, 2D and 3D rendering, mock-ups, collages, pictures, describing the 
idea with some text or simply drawing it on a piece of paper – see Figure 1. We 
encouraged participants to gather in advance some random bits of recycled and found 
objects from around their home to be used during the workshop. 
In the first slides of the shared Google document, we outlined a draft of the workshop 
structure. We arranged the schedule drawing on the design fiction workshops 
described by Andersen [10], where practical and fast-paced tasks are introduced to 
urge creative making and sidestep insecurity and overthinking - see slides 2 and 3. In 
the same introductory slides we also included a set of guidelines for the use of the 
online workspace. In particular, we were concerned that participants would modify or

delete the work of others. We therefore suggested placing every new idea in a new 
slide, and to insert concept variations next to each other so as to generate “linear 
taxonomies” of absurdities. 
In order to let participants familiarise with the workshop tools and modalities we 
shared the Google doc a few days before the event, including the two slides for the 
activity guidelines and structure. To facilitate and inspire participants, we also 
designed a slide template to be filled with contents and a few examples of absurd 
instruments – e.g. the Slow Growth Piano in Figure 2.
A Solid 3%
Attendees responded enthusiastically to the workshop call (i.e. fully booked event), 
suggesting a desire to contribute to and participate in the kind of exchanges elicited 
by our absurd activity. Overall, during the two hours participants fervently created 
over 300 questionable musical ideas and absurd instruments – as gladly noticed by one 
of the organisers: “a solid 3%”.
The design concepts uploaded touched upon a variety of techno-musical issues. In 
what follows we reflect on a curated selection of improbable musical ideas, and 
provide an overview of the diversity of outcomes produced during the activity.

Visionary and Critical NIME Statements
Many of the design concepts proposed by participants unlock clever techno-musical 
visions which we might experience in the next future. An example of such unrealistic 
yet captivating concept is the Personal Stylus: an embodied turntable stylus which 
translate surfaces into sound (see Figure 3).
Some of the instruments proposed during the workshop exploit irony to critique NIME 
research clichés and commonplaces. As an example, participants would often place an 
image of a piezo transducer connected to a knob on the top of any instrument ideas, so 
to create the “augmented” version of that given artefact – see some of the examples 
provided below.
The Laptop Ensemble shown in Figure 4 makes fun of the laptop orchestras we often 
found in music technology institutions through the idea of making music using only the 
default operating system sounds of our machines. Another critical approach found in 
our absurd catalogue looks at existing music technology devices considering the 
specific aesthetics they promote – e.g. Light Opera Tribe a sequencer specifically 
designed for the production of “crap” opera music (Figure 5).

Other participants instead targeted nominal NIME research concepts to provoke 
playful reflections on the impact they had throughout the years. This is the case of the 
Crumple Brahms, a mockery of composed instrument concept [16] where “the 
composition is the instrument”; and the HyperMetaCyberInstrument: “the only 
instrument you will ever need”, which winks to John Bowers’ and his Infra-Instruments 
notion [17] – see Figure 6.

Absurd Variations and Collages
Another ideation process we observed was the practice of generating variations of 
illogical and silly concepts around a theme. Indeed, since we anticipated its creative 
potential, while presenting the activity, we mentioned this strategy in the workshop 
guidelines. This technique of creative reiteration generated a wide spectrum of 
concepts that are sometime difficult to organise in homogeneous groups.

Examples of impractical interface ‘genealogies’ include instruments based on food and 
beverage, see Figure 7. In this particular area, frequent musical puns were alcohol 
based instruments such as the Tuned up Glass Harp (Figure 8), which has a 
resemblance to Perry Cook’s Fillup Glass [18], and the Breathalyser Saxophone which 
only plays sounds if alcohol is detected in the breath of the performer.

Participants also proposed various musical designs inspired by the ways the pandemic 
modified human communication. These comprise the Corona Mask Breath Amp, which 
amplifies the “muffled murmurs present in current communication” by placing two 
Kazoos on a mask at the nostrils level. The Zoomtar instead makes Zoom calls more

musical by providing “an exciting performance to accompany important meetings” (see 
Figure 9). Specifically conceived for our workshop, the 10,000 Instrument Squared is a 
device that “analyses zoom calls and uses advanced deep learning to synthesise the 
sounds that would be made by any absurd musical instruments mentioned”.
Out of the many taxonomies of absurd instruments proposed by participants we 
identified a particularly interesting sub-group of concepts characterised by minimal 
and open-ended design features. These abstract ideas – often presented only with a 
title and very little or no description – include the Bendable Continuous Instrument 
which, amongst others variations, evolved into the Polyphonic Bendable Discrete 
Instrument and the Not Bendable Discrete Instrument — see Figure 10.

Another example of a rather cryptic musical artefact is the Black Box instrument, a 
concept which first appeared with the description “I am not sure what it does”. Such 
intriguing and open-ended artefacts stimulated the imagination of our participants. 
Iterations of the Black Box instrument include The Frankencode Black Box which 
“takes all your old crappy, poorly implemented code snippets, normalises inputs and 
outputs and turns it all into beautiful music” and The Ultimate NIME: a “permanently 
sealed” box that “contains the ultimate NIME - an interface perfectly balancing a 
moderate learning curve with quick pay-offs and superior user satisfaction”. 
Ultimately, The Ultimate NIME became the The Augmented Ultimate NIME, as 
augmentation was achieved by placing a piezo on the top of the box — Figure 11.

Overall, we could appreciate how the ‘variation mechanism’ often functioned as an 
incentive for the ideation of absurd interfaces. While creating new variations, 
participants were able to develop a broad range of statements around different music 
technology topics and artefacts by responding to the absurd ideas and comments 
presented by their fellows.
An example of such a reiterative device is shown in Figure 12 where it is possible to 
appreciate the complete set of alterations which began with the silly idea of the 
Hammer instrument. The Hammer alterations illustrate how participants used to grab 
and edit low quality images (e.g. from the internet) to retrieve multiple times the same 
questionable concept in rapid fashion. Alternatively to this approach, occasionally 
attendees introduced new absurd meanings by simply adapting the artefact 
description. 
During the workshop participants often edited and rapidly combined different images 
to generate questionable and amusing musical instruments. Examples of such image 
compositions are the Flying Horn – an impractical technique to play horn instruments, 
Figure 13

and the the LRADs instruments which propose alternative designs of the LRAD weapon 
(Long Range Acoustic Device) – Figure 13. The collages created were made with 
images of everyday objects and tools, popular culture references as well as snapshots 
of music technology artefacts. These assemblages are often based on the loose 
combination of ‘found’ low quality pictures. Far from being refined design illustrations, 
these instruments therefore emphasise the value of the concept and ideation process 
over the hypothetical final product.
Participants also exploited the collage technique to iterate concepts previously 
introduced by other attendees. The handy and rapid process of reiterating found and 
decontextualised images then served as a compelling device to further develop others’ 
ideas. A device that gave attendees the opportunity to follow playful and silly 
intuitions, and possibly explore challenging and risky concepts through humour and 
absurdity.
Making the Familiar Strange
While reviewing the workshop outcomes, it appears evident that working remotely 
within the boundaries of our homes caused a shift towards the domestic, as we 
reflected upon the tools and materials around us for potential NIME making.
Many of the questionable instruments developed during the workshop are based on 
highly personal items which are part of the domestic and everyday experience. For 
instance, participants often proposed impractical concepts using household objects 
and tools like stationery, kitchen utensils and furniture. The Lockdown Organ is a 
brilliant example of such an approach, where toilet roll tubes are recycled to build an 
instrument for pandemic times. Similarly, artefacts like DIY data sock and Melodiyoga 
provide a good sense of the mundane and domestic qualities that characterise many of 
the workshop's absurd designs — see Figure 14.

These examples illustrate how, during the activity, familiar and everyday objects 
suddenly become exceptional and enigmatic. Making strange or defamiliarisation is a 
technique often exploited by artists to intensify and broaden the perception of common 
things: “[..] the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be 
prolonged” [19]. Defamiliarisation can be therefore understood as a device that forces 
us to (re)consider how we perceive the familiar and the tacit [20].

In the context of our workshop, the process of making something strange generally 
relies on the intimate relationships between people and their objects. These artefacts 
might sometimes result as rather cryptic and less available for reinterpretation. We 
suggest that our participants used the device of defamiliarisation in order to twist the 
obvious and provide contradictory viewpoints on both mundane objects and techno-
musical assumptions. These musical artefacts can be considered as playful 
opportunities to generate subjective musical visions that allow participants (and 
ourselves) to explore inner, alternative and contradictory design spaces.
Resourcefulness was echoed throughout our proposed designs, as we found inspiration 
by scavenging, reimagining and augmenting the everyday. Although the workshop 
generated a wild number of fictional, absurd and somewhat impossible outcomes never 
to come into fruition, we can look to the potential benefits of exploring the domestic 
and the everyday in our design and making practices, adding to the discourse on some 
of the socio-political, socio-economic and environmental issues present within our 
community [21] [22].
Discussion
Let us bring out a number of points prompted by the 10,000 Instruments Workshop for 
further discussion. In this way, we hope to show how our experience connects to 
broader concerns in the NIME community and how its format and the values behind it 
can be taken forward into new research areas.
Open-Endedness and Resourcing Research
It is important to note that our workshop had no (or little) closure. We kept the 
workshop open-ended and, indeed, there was nothing to prevent any participant taking 
a copy of the Google document we made and freely developing it further themselves. 
This contrasts with many creativity methods which move at some stage to a second 
evaluation or selection phase, sometimes with some form of rating or voting activity, 
with a view to identifying a single or a small number of proposals to favour. This is the 
case, for example, in traditional brainstorming as first formulated by Osborn in 1953 
[23]. There is a sense also in which, compared with classical brainstorming, our 
workshop was ‘open-beginninged’. We did not begin with a specific question against 
which proposals could be evaluated (also contra Osborn). Our logic is different.
Rather, we see the corpus of design ideas that the workshop generated as a potential 
‘infrastructure’ in the sense of the A. Telier design collective [24]. It can be taken as a 
set of resources and exemplars which can be the basis for future work and thought.

Speculation
19
Some of the proposals, in spite of our best efforts, might actually be possible to make. 
Some might provoke further thinking about the kinds of materials that need to be 
developed to realise design fantasy. Some put into sharp relief whom we imagine our 
participants, musicians, users, or whatever we wish to call them, itself not an innocent 
matter, to be. Some might suggest aesthetic reflections on the kinds of music we want 
to make, how and why. In all these respects, the corpus of proposals serve as resources 
for addressing design concerns and as exemplars which can be drawn upon (or 
negated) as and when they seem appropriate.
As such, our workshop offers an image of a non-solutionist approach to design. Very 
often design work is conceived as a matter of solving problems. Indeed, research itself 
is often conceived this way or as answering questions. In the classical logic of 
brainstorming discussed earlier, an emphasis is placed on formulating a problem 
precisely and coherently and not attempting to address multiple issues at once. There 
are no problems being solved in our workshop, or at least, problem-solving, ‘heuristic’ 
activity, is not central. It is displaced. Rather, a design space is being created while it is 
being explored with the creation of the space and its exemplification being two sides of 
the one process. 
Problem-oriented design and research often have with them a (sometimes 
unarticulated, taken for granted) space within which possible solutions can be 
articulated. The implicit existence of such spaces is a kind of ‘practical a priori’ for 
problematisation. Our work is not about formulating or solving problems in any 
traditional sense. It is rather about enriching the design spaces within which such 
affairs could be formulated and saturating those spaces with exemplars, a little 
concept-development, and much humour. If problems are encountered or raised for us, 
we are ready, but its is not necessary for our work that it offers solutions here and now.
Treasuring the Domestic
By reflecting upon the domestic themes emerging from many of the workshop’s 
fictional outcomes, such as those related to common materials, tools, objects or 
processes, we could also consider how DIY approaches and ‘everydayness’ could be 
explored as a route to creating a more diverse and `outward-looking’ community [2]. 
Reframing and recontextualising NIME projects through an alternative lens, such as 
with a DIY craft-led focus, creates a potential gateway into NIME and other music 
technology activities, where socio-political and socio-economic barriers prevent 
engagement and access to our often expensive and exclusive field.

DIY craft-focused entries, such as the fictional Lockdown Organ and DIY Data Sock 
could offer potential benefits in NIME pedagogy and accessibility, because of their low 
cost, non-specialist methods of production and use of familiar and domestic materials.
Placing DIY craft activity at the forefront of an instrument building project can be a 
useful tool in exploring ideas in NIME design/making with new audiences, by using the 
often more familiar aspects of DIY hobby craft as a vehicle to engage with ideas in 
interface design, DIY electronics, HCI, experimental music making, sonic arts and 
more. The use of everyday tools allows for such projects to be built at home or in 
grassroots, community-centred workshops, outside of academic or lab-based settings. 
Exploring these relatable and familiar scenarios in novel creative technology-based 
projects can be a useful pedagogical tool in empowering and asserting confidence in 
new and non-specialist audiences, through playful yet meaningful experiences and 
opportunities, which could in turn lead to further engagement and be a positive step 
towards creating a more diverse future NIME community.
A Composite Annotated Portfolio
John Bowers and Bill Gaver and colleagues ([6] [7] and [25]) have discussed the 
concept of ‘annotated portfolio’ as a way of developing design work in HCI beyond a 
set of single examples. Our workshop format is meaningfully indebted with this 
approach: a form of reflective analysis that can be engaged in drawing out the 
similarities and differences between the designs in a portfolio to speak to HCI research 
issues via ‘annotations' [7].
In the context of our research, a complexly organised annotated portfolio emerged as a 
by-product of idea generation. Participants often drew out the similarities and 
differences between the proposals as they were making them. This is reflected in the 
rough organisation of the Google document, how related designs cluster together, how 
images are shared, how text is copied and pasted and altered, how local linear 
taxonomies emerge, and how participants sometimes literally annotated what is there. 
This occurs as a natural feature of generating ideas and situating them in relation to 
others in a shared document.
In our work, the document (portfolio), and the ways it has been organised and 
annotated, often have a taxonomic or indexing role in helping the reader work through 
the proposed instruments. They might also specify new research topics for future 
work. But they can also have a further creative role. For instance, annotations can 
serve as a way of structuring a concert or an exhibition, especially when performances

21
or artworks have an ‘assemblage’ character, that is being made of multiple, materially 
different components - e.g. in educational settings when presenting to the public the 
projects developed by students during a music technology module.
Pedagogical Implications
A number of us have taken the workshop format into our own teaching activities. It is 
worth reflecting on this as a particular kind of pedagogical intervention. Very 
commonly, pedagogy is formulated as the imparting of knowledge or skill with the 
pedagogue someone who has that knowledge or skill and seeks to inculcate such in the 
students. Our pedagogical orientation is different. First, aside from formulating a 
topic, convening the workshop, and outlining ways of contributing to it, we become 
participants alongside everyone else. We all participate by generating and annotating 
ideas, piggy-backing on others, contributing to the emergence of themes, enjoying the 
humour and spontaneity. 
At no stage in the workshop do we evaluate the outcomes or suggest upshots from the 
process as ‘lessons learned’. As such, our workshop has much in common with 
educational philosophies which emphasise the self-organisation of learning. For 
example, the philosopher Jacques Rancière [26] formulates the concept of The 
Ignorant Schoolmaster where ‘schoolmasters’ facilitate learning subjects that they 
have no knowledge of themselves. The key is to affirm the equal intelligence of all 
involved, build on the students’ existing knowledge and curiosity, and provide 
resources to enable them to find out for themselves. 
While we, the authors, cannot boast ignorance of NIME, our approach has much in 
common. We do not see our participants as lacking any faculty or ability that we seek 
to remedy. And through the provision of certain minimal materials and the 
encouragement to use common resources (internet searches, the emerging body of 
proposals itself), our participants find things out for themselves, as, for that matter, do 
we.
While these types of ideation work have been explored before in music technology and 
HCI, such work is often based on word-based brainstorms and sorting exercises of post-
it notes e.g. [27] (and online equivalents such as Miro). The novel contribution here 
lies in the use of a standard slide set as a site for collaboration, the possibilities in 
cut/paste as basis for fast iterations, and the live performative qualities of the 
workshop itself. As such the workshop format is uniquely suitable for online ideation, 
making use of existing tools and time-limited co-presence.

Workshop Improvisation
Much of the conduct of our workshop participants can be said to have improvisatory 
character. They were dealing with a thematic provocation in real-time, riffing on 
suggestions made by others, taking them forwards in ways which then suggested 
further variations from others. There have been various influences from improvisation 
practices in HCI [28] [29] - particularly, theatre improvisation informed aspects of the 
work based around characters and scenarios (e.g. [30]). It is striking how well some 
improvisation concepts fit how our participants conducted themselves in the workshop. 
Keith Johnstone [31], for example, discusses a format for improvisation where the 
actors 1) ‘establish a platform’, 2) ‘tilt’ it, and 3) ‘reincorporate’ material that has 
already been introduced. Many of the interactions between our contributors had this 
character. A particular cluster of designs might be developed (e.g. variations on the 
banjo), tilted (made of greasy products), and other ideas reincorporated (with a piezo 
on top). As is commonly argued in writings on improvisation, participants should 
always aim for generativity - for making contributions that make it easier for others to 
make theirs - and not engage in ‘blocking’ (e.g. by flatly negating the platform that has 
been built up leaving one’s co-improvisor speechless). Our participants rarely blocked 
each other in this way and the remote conferencing character of the interaction helped 
if one was blocked for whatever reason. These affinities between improvisation and 
creative workshop formats, instructions, and methods of analysis and reflection are 
worth pursuing further.
In line with the spirit of the event, exchanges and variations usually occurred in a 
rather disorganised and discontinuous fashion. Participants started to reiterate absurd 
ideas since the third phase of the workshop, and continued, freely jumping from one 
absurd artefact to another, until the end of the event. On this note, we observed that 
only a few verbal exchanges occurred during the workshop (via Zoom video chat) and 
participants primarily focused on the ‘practical’ task of creating musical absurdities 
without coordinating with each other. Overall, we argue that these messy iterations 
and permissive transitions can be considered as an essential element of our activity, 
which enabled a good diversity of outcomes.
Conclusions
The 10,000 Instruments workshop may offer a vehicle to explore critical attitudes 
detached from overly theoretical discourses which can themselves be exclusionary. On 
the other hand, even the trend of poking fun at NIME clichés is well within established

norms of the NIME community, and in some cases the humour of the workshop 
outcomes took the form of inside jokes. The fact that the workshop has been held 
within the NIME conference might have conditioned the work of our participants. 
Similarly, our selection of artefacts purposely focuses on some of the stereotypes and 
assumptions linked to NIME practices.
Still, by quickly reviewing the more-than-300 ideas collected, it is possible to get a 
sense of the activity’s variety of outcomes. We then argue that, due to the generative 
potential of our approach, the same workshop method, repeated in other contexts and 
communities of musical practice, would produce completely different results. It might 
also reveal assumptions and trends characterising particular socio-musical settings. 
We would like to close this paper by making contact with the conference theme of 
Decolonising Musical Interfaces. We intend to do this with some care and in a spirit of 
allyship. Decolonisation was not the direct topic of our workshop, nor did it become an 
explicit theme in what participants proposed. It must also be admitted that, as authors, 
we are well embedded, even if uneasily so,  within disciplines and institutions with 
colonial pasts and presents. Yet, there are many affinities between the commitments in 
our work and important discussions of decoloniality.
For example, in her early work on decolonialidad, Maria Lugones [32] [33] argues that 
playfulness is essential to ‘world-travelling’, as non-hierarchical connections are made 
which recognise ‘interlocked multiplicities’ and new decolonial identities are formed. 
For Lugones, playfulness, trickery and foolery enable different worlds to be brought 
into relation, creating ambiguities which are not just funny but ‘survival-rich’. 
Importantly, and contrary to theorisations which take competitive, rule-governed 
games as the paradigmatic occasion for play (e.g. [34]): “Playfulness is, in part, an 
openness to being a fool, which is a combination of not worrying about competence, 
not being self-important, not taking norms as sacred and finding ambiguity and double 
edges a source of wisdom and delight” [32], p. 17. 
Lugones commends that we engage in ‘festive resistance’ which, amongst other 
activities, consists in “blurring categories... reinvention of our names for things and 
people... marking cultural mixtures... revealing the chaotic in production... announcing 
the impurity of the pure by ridiculing his inability at self-maintenance” [33], p. 478.
We hope our workshop honoured this spirit of festive resistance as we travel to and 
from the world of NIME.

Ethics Statement
We informed participants about our intention to make public the workshop outcomes 
(i.e. the shared online document) as a roughly organised collection of instrument ideas 
and conversations emerged during the event. We also made clear that the sketches 
and annotations created during the workshop will be under a Creative Commons 
License (CC BY-NC-ND) — see introductory slide number 3.
In this paper we present and comment on a selection of instrument ideas, treating 
them as available resources which might stimulate future debates around 
unconventional instrument design methods and expand the variety of outcomes linked 
to NIME research. We cover these key ethical issues towards the end of our paper.
Due to the nature of the online format adopted, when the number of participants is 
high, it is difficult to spot potential frictions between participants (e.g. unintentional 
modification of other people's material). In the context of NIME all attendees signed in 
voluntarily and we had the general impression of people partaking with enthusiasm 
and purpose. However, in a different context, participants might not be willing to 
engage and share as much as our participants did. From this viewpoint the workshop 
format has limitations, as it makes it difficult to pay particular attention to specific sub-
groups or individuals.
To facilitate the process of sharing ideas and mitigating possible frictions, we also 
encouraged participants to consider whether the uploaded contents might be 
inappropriate for other attendees, and we suggested a set of key words to provide 
some more specific cues on the kind of permissive and open-ended approach we 
envisioned for the workshop (see slide 3).
In terms of access, diversity and code of conduct, our workshop conformed with the 
statements and guidelines provided by the NIME 2020 organising committee. In line 
with the accessibility measures adopted throughout the conference, live captioning 
was available for those participants that requested it. We also planned various rest 
breaks to ease the workshop’s attendance and limit screen fatigue. 
Finally, we believe that our activity does not present particular challenge in terms of 
resources and costs and we declare that we have no conflicts of interest in carrying 
out this work or in this paper, financially or otherwise.
