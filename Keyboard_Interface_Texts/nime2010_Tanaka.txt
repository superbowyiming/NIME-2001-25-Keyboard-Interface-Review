1. INTRODUCTION 
As the NIME community enter s i t s  s e c o n d  d e c a d e ,  w e  t a k e  
stock of its centers of interest, th e knowledge that has 
accumulated, and the new directions that are taking shape. We 
review the literature on two of the federating themes in NIME 
research: that of defining the instrument , and that of mapping. 
We first look at w ork establishing the field le ading up to the 
first NIME conference in 2001 , followed by developments in 
technology that have broadened the field. We then reconsider 
the notion of instrument and approaches to mapping together, 
and see how they can inform the development of a series of new 
instruments built on commonly available platforms.  
The late Michel Waisvisz place d a n  i m p o r t a n c e  o n  t h e  
viscerality of a electro -instrumental system [ 12]. Ryan reported 
on the STEIM approach [ 32], and also reflected on the 
importance o f  e x p r e s s i v i t y  i n h i s  o w n  w o r k  [33]. Cadoz h a d  
been interested in ways in which types of gestures in mu sical 
performance [ 20] w e r e  r e l e v a n t to live performance of  
computer music [6].  
Winkler presented early  t e c h n i q u e s  of best practice for 
programming interaction in live m usic performance in [ 43]. 
Wanderley and Battier created the first compendium of texts in 
this area, where many of the early work in the field  [ 40], 
including that of the present author, are presented [ 35]. 
With the establishment of NIME in 2001  as a workshop at the 
Computer Human  I n t e r a c t ion (CHI) conference  [ 31], i t s  
establishment as a full conference in 2002, and the archiving of 
its proceedings in the Association for Computing Machinery 
(ACM) Digital Library  in 2005, an existing musical community 
coalesced into a n d  established it as  a  r e s e a r c h  f i e l d .  C o m m o n  
themes began to emerge, and forms of best practice could be 
transmitted. Two of the predominant themes were the definition 
of a electronic musical instrument, and approaches to mapping 
gesture to sound.  Throughout this, there is the underlying goal 
to make advancement in the creation of expressive musical 
systems. 
2. DEFINING THE INSTRUMENT 
Miranda and Wanderl ey [ 26] describe  a n  i n t e r a c t i v e  m u s i c a l  
instrument as  b e i n g a  s y s t e m  c o m p r i s e d  o f t h r e e  b a s i c  
subsystems:  
• Sensor input 
• Mapping 
• Sound synthesis  
More recently with the increasing use of mobile devices in 
NIME, Essl, Wang, and Roh  d e s c r i b e g e n e r i c  q u a l i t i e s  a s 
desirable characteristic s o f  e l e c t r o n i c  i n s t r u m e n t  b u i l d i n g ,  i n  
their case , o n  m o b i l e  i n s t r u m e n t s [ 13, 14]. T h e  c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s  
defining generic for them are flexible without specific 
prefiguring, designed without a specific musical work as a 
driver. Meanwhile, the present author has written about 
idiomaticity of instruments and the distinction of an instrument 
from a tool [ 36]. Camurri introduces the notion of entrainment 
in expressive musical gesture [ 7]. Here the notion of a generic 
system meets the situation -specific instrumental circumstances 
that lead to forms of corporeal motor instincts such as muscle 
memory that constitutes entrainment. 
It is interesting noting that e a r l y i n  t h e  h i s t o r y  o f  N I M E ,  
considerable d i s c u s s i o n  t h a t  t o o k  p l a c e  o n  w h e t h e r t h e  “ I ”  o f  
NIME should be  the word , Instrument, or the word , Interface. 
The choice of inter face reflects a desire to open up the fie ld, but 
also perhaps a recognition of  t h e  c h a l l e n g e  i n  a r r i v i n g  a t  a  
single vision of what a NIME instrument should or could be.  
In an attempt to leave room for new developments, yet identify 
federating characteristics, one proposed  working definition of  
the instrument is that of a system that is  autonomous and open -
ended [ 36]. By autonomous we mean self -contained and self -
sufficient. This could mean that audio content, sonic 
modification, and control i n t e r a c t i o n  c o-exist on the same 
device. By open-ended, we mean extensible systems. This could 
mean modifications adding to or enhancing an instrument ’s 
sonic characteristics.

This drew upon evolution of musical instruments from 
acoustical instruments to multi -component systems like the 
electric guitar and associated effects pedals and amplifier, to 
turntable as musical instrument where choice of content (in this 
case the vinyl record used) made it open -ended. 
Notions from instrumental practice have been used to inform 
interaction design.  B e a u d o i n-Lafon defines Instrumental 
Interaction as a set of techniques to draw upon tool usage in the 
real world to inform graphic user interface (GUI) design [ 1]. 
Interaction instruments mediate the space between GUI users 
and domain objects. Instrumenta l properties include degrees of 
indirection (spatial and temporal offsets), integration (mapping 
of degrees of freedom), and compatibility (consistency of action 
and response modes). Verillon [39] calls on the act of 
instrumentalisation to distinguish betw een tools and 
instruments, a theme that is directly relevant to music, and an 
issue of differentiation that has been discussed by this author in 
distinguishing musical instruments from tools [ 36]. 
We can draw upon taxonomies of embodiment developed in the 
field of Tangible User Interfaces to c a t e g o r i z e  t h e  s e l f -
contained nature or  level of distributedness of a musical 
instrument. Fishkin defines embodiment as the extent to which  
input focus of a system is bound to the output focus [ 15]. He 
goes on to discern four levels of embodiment:  
• Distant – where system output is remote with respect 
to the input device 
• Environmental – where output surrounds the input but 
is not graspable 
• Nearby – where output is proximal to input  
• Full – w h e r e  t h e  o u t p u t  d e v i c e  a n d  i n p u t  device 
coincide 
This range of embodiment can be applied to musical 
instruments in different ways. A pipe organ in a church can be 
considered the clearest case of distant embodiment w h e r e  
keyboard actioning is far from actual sound output , a s  
compared to the  violin in which the coincidence of the  gestural 
articulation of bowing and actual  a c o u s t i c a l  o u t p u t  r e p r e s e n t s  
full embodiment. Electric guitars, an example of open ended in 
[36], can from the viewpoint of embodiment, be considered 
nearby embodiment, cou pling the guitar, via pickup to 
amplifier. Finally, a cousmatic music in this sense could be 
thought of as  e n v i r o n m e n t a l  e m b o d i m e n t w h e r e  a  c o m p o s e r  
performs an orchestra of speakers in a space from a central 
console.  
In the case of NIME instrument buildin g, systems that capture 
performer gesture and produce sonic musical output  mean that 
full embodiment is an implicit goal and criteria of success . The 
notion of expressivity is a core principle, and indeed, part of the 
NIME acronym. It is assumed, but is el usive as a concept. From 
Cadoz to Camurri, researchers have tried to cha racterize 
expressivity. Meanwhile for performing artists like Ryan, 
expressiveness in musical performance is taken to be intuitive 
and empirical. For purposes of the musical interactio n concepts 
discussed in this paper, we will take expressivity of a musical 
instrument to mean specific musical affordances of an 
instrument that allow the musician performing on the 
instrument to artfully and reliably articulate sound output of 
varying nat ure that communicates musical intent, energy, and 
emotion to the listener. The success of expressivity resides not 
just in the effectiveness of communication, but in the sense of 
agency that the system gives back to the performer.  
3. MUSICAL AFFORDANCE 
Affordance is a concept fundamental to interaction design 
practice. Arising from Gibson’s seminal work in perceptual 
psychology, it maps potential action relationships between 
subject and object based on qualities of the object and 
capabilities of the subject [ 18]. Norman introduced affordance 
in design practice, providing guidance for ways to create 
designs for objects that project perceived possibilities of usage 
[27]. Perception is crucial to both Gibson and Norman, but 
treated more explicitly by Norman. While  G i b s o n  d i s c u s s e s  
emergent properties, perceived or not, of an object giving to its 
affordance for action, Norman very practically encourages a 
designer to create perceptions to suggest usage. Gaver 
reconciles and extends these notions by proposing hidden and 
perceptible affordances, as well as types of complex 
affordances [17]. 
Affordance has been called upon in describing computer music 
systems. Magnusson applies the concepts of affordance to 
inform the design of screen based interactive music systems.  
Gurevich [ 21], Braasch [5 ], and Dillon and Brown  [ 11] draw 
upon  affordance theory to inform the design of  network music 
systems. Cook and Pullin apply  affordance in design practice to 
facilitate creating musical interfaces from everyday objects [ 9]. 
This be comes in some ways a musical manifestation of Chung 
and Ishii’s Mega-Affordance objects [8]. 
Affordance has been used in the sociology of music by DeNora 
to look at music -as-practice, and the sociality of music , to begin 
to characterize what might be affor ded by certain pieces of 
music to listeners of that music  [10]. T h i s  h a s  a n  i n t e r e s t i n g  
parallel in sensory motor studies by Godøy where subjects are 
asked to trace gestures as they listen to music to infer an 
affordance innate in the musical sound [ 19].   
4. MAPPING 
Mapping is commonly defined as  t h e  t r a n s l a t i o n  l a y e r  
correlating gesture to sound.  Hunt and Wanderley  conducted an 
early literature review and established basic principles of 
mapping in gestural music  [22]. 
They identify 4 types of mappings  
• 1 to 1 
• 1 to many (divergent) 
• Many to 1 (convergent)  
• Many to many 
They distinguish perceptual parameters from abstract 
parameters and conclude by proposing a two -layer model. 
Wessel introduces early use of tablets interfaces and multi -
touch surfaces and speaks o f  e x p r e s s i v e n e s s  i n  f o r m s  o f  
intimate interaction – l e v e l s  o f  s u b t l e t y  t h a t  a r e  s a t i s f y i n g  f o r  
the performer  [ 42]. He p r o p o s e s  several metaphors for meta-
mapping interaction: 
• Scrubbing 
• Catch/Throw 
• Dipping 
Paine applied user centered design method in cond ucting an 
interview-based design of mapping for a specific interface 
device (the Thummer)  [ 29]. Tarabella considers the mapping 
problem by using gestural metaphors from established 
instruments (i.e. piano) as a point of departure. He applies this 
to investigate the potential of spontaneity and improvisation of 
computer music [38].

4.1 From Mapping to Musical Phrases 
While the existing literature investigates mapping techniques to 
yield expressive musical situations, they either focus on specific 
instrument examples, or on isolated gestural events. Conceiving 
of effective strategies for creating higher level musical output 
requires deploying layers of different mappings that work in 
tandem to allow the articulation of musical phrases. A  p h r a s e  
here is used in a m ore general sense than in music theory, and 
includes high-level musical events encapsulating phrases, meta -
events, and complex musical structures.  
Articulation of musical phrases i s  n o t  t y p i c a l l y  e x e c u t e d  b y  a  
single mapping. Here we propose a model of min imum three 
types of mappings that work on conjunction to formulate the 
articulation of a musical unit. The proposed mapping types are:  
1. Binary mapping 
2. Basic parametric mapping (s) 
3. Expressive mapping(s) 
If we consider a traditional instrument such as the viol in, the 
elements necessary for articulation of sound can be seen as: 1) 
contact of the bow with the string (binary), 2) selection of the 
length of string (basic parameter), and 3) vibrato (expressive).  
The definition of these three mapping types, then, sho uld not be 
seen as limiting, but as a point of departure.  
We can apply this tri -partite mapping structure to the metaphor s 
proposed by Wessel and Wright:  
Scrubbing:  
• Sound on/off (Binary) 
• Sound selection (Basic) 
• Scrubbing position (Expressive) 
Catch/Throw: 
• Capture live sound (Binary) 
• Choice of effect (Basic) 
• Effects parameters (Expressive) 
Dipping:  
• Dip on/off (Binary) 
• Dip volume (Basic) 
• Additional transformation parameters  (Expressive) 
This model can also be applied to higher order mus ical meta -
events, whe re the “b inary” c a n  a r t i c u l a t e  a group of note or 
sound events, with “b asic” r e p r e s e n ting a  p a r a m e t e r  s u c h  a s  
playback spe ed of a sequence, and “e xpressive” modulating 
synthesis parameters that affect the timbre of the sequence and 
clusters that are sounding.  
4.2 Complex Mappings 
There are several ways to arrive at the three levels of mapping 
needed to generate a musical event as described. The Binary 
mapping can be seen as an activation o f  t h e  s o u n d ,  t h e  B a s i c  
mapping as a fixed parameter  i n t he articulation of the sound, 
and the Expressive mapping being a continuously varying 
parameter that follows the gesture and is mapped to modulation 
of the sound. In order to derive these three levels of mapping 
from one sensor,  a single input must be processed in differe nt 
ways.  
From a given i n p u t ,  w e  c a n  d e r i v e  t h e  B i n a r y  m a p p i n g  b y  
setting a threshold level to trigger the event. The Basic mapping 
can be derived by looking at the slope of the input curve, it’s 
rate of change over a small time window, at the time of the 
trigger. The Expressive mapping can then follow the sensor 
input to modulate a sound synthesis parameter. The use of a 
single sensor input to generate three types of mappings (albeit 
to control a single musical event) can be considered using Hunt 
and Wanderley’s classifications as a “One to Many”, or 
divergent type of mapping.  
Techniques for deriving rich interaction in this configuration 
include splitting the sensor input and applying different levels 
of filtering for each type of mapping. The Binary trigger might 
be driven off of the sensor input with slight filtering with a 
programmed Schmitt trigger to avoid accidental multiple 
triggering [34]. This puts in place two comparators, one for the 
main trigger, and a second, downward comparator in a 
hysteresis loop allowing new event triggers only after the 
system is “re -armed” by crossing the downward threshold . 
Meanwhile the Basic mapping in this case can be derived from 
a branch that applies smoothing in the form of a low pass filter 
on the sensor input. Th e Expressive mapping could be derived 
from the raw sensor data with no filtering for maximum 
responsiveness, or with a slight level of smoothing to 
distinguish it from the basic mapping, depending on the musical 
situation at hand.  R e s p o n s i v e n e s s  o f  e a c h  b ranch can be set 
independently with different latencies inhe rent in the types of 
filtering used.  We  c a n  c a l l  t h i s Complex Mapping , where one 
gesture is subject to several post -processing branches to yield 
multiple mappings. 
4.3 Compound Mappings 
Another approac h to derive the three levels of mapping 
described is by the application of Hunt and Wanderley’s 
“Many-to-One”, or convergent t e c h n i q u e .  H e r e  “ m a n y ”  r e f e r s  
to multiple sensors on a single gesture, or the capturing of 
multiple gestures, and “one” refers to a s i n g l e  m u s i c a l  e v e n t  
being shaped by multiple parametric control.  This approach can 
be addressed by applying techniques of multimodal interaction. 
In the classical multimodal interaction, a single gesture can be 
captured by multiple sensing modes. Applied  t o  t h e  p r e s e n t  
context of deriving three mappings in order to articulate a single 
musical event, each mode can be optimized to yield the kind of 
signal best suited for a binary, basic, or expressive mapping. On 
a Nintendo Wii remote, this can be thought of as the button, 
infrared camera, and accelerometer. We have applied the notion 
of multimodal sensing to arm gesture, c aptured by biosensors 
and accelerometers [37]. 
The Many -to-One scenario can be realized also by the use of 
multiple gestures to articulat e a single musical event. This could 
mean articulating a sound with one gesture while modulating it 
with another. Conditional situations can be set in he forms of 
double triggers, logical AND where a Binary mapping is set 
only if multiple thresholds are al l crossed, or a Schmitt trigger 
is set while an auxiliary sensor is above a threshold, or in a 
logical OR where any number of multiple sensor inputs could 
trigger a sound, later to be modulated. More sophisticated  
interrelations can be created, such as Activity Windows where a 
range of sensor values in one input open a window in which a 
second sensor might influence a certain parameter in the sound 
being articulated. A series of windows can be established 
creating a situation where Sensor 2 modulates diffe rent sound 
synthesis parameters depending on the window activated by 
Sensor 1.  I n  t h i s  w a y ,  t h e s e  m a p p i n g s  c a n  b e  c o n s i d e r e d

5. DEMOCRATISATION AND 
MOBILITY 
Alongside evolution in the field, with the establishment of 
communities of practice  a n d  t h e  N I M E  c o n f e r e n c e  h a v e  b e e n  
the increased accessibility of sensor technologies and industrial 
and consumer applications of them. The early systems 
Proceedings of the 2010 Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME 2010), Sydney, Australia

described by Waisvisz required development of custom 
hardware and software systems. While a focus of N IME 
research remains the invention of new systems, this now 
customarily takes place on standardized software environments 
such as Max, PD, SuperCollider, and accessible hardware 
platforms such as the iCube or Arduino. Meanwhile the 
explosion of consumer devices with built -in sensors such as 
mobile phones and game controllers such as the Nintendo Wii -
remote have opened up and democratized NIME practice 
outside the realm of academic research.  
5.1 Participation 
This potential of broadening participation has a pro found 
impact on the contexts in which NIME research finds itself, and 
new opportunities for the application of knowledge created in 
our field over the years. These new contexts include  
• Enhanced musical interaction in consumer products  
• New forms of amateur music making 
• Increased dissemination of NIME performances  
The integration of sensors in and the increasing sophistication 
of game controllers has led to the increasing richness of musical 
interactions in computer games. Blaine surveys the use of novel 
input devices in musical video games  [3]. Bott has looked at 3D 
spatial interaction with standard game controllers for expressive 
amateur music activities [4 ]. W e  h a v e  c o i n e d  t h e  n o t i o n  o f  
“music one participates in” to capture participatory musical 
activity [24]. 
Meanwhile mobile devices such as smartphones have 
accelerometers, and touchscreens for input, and processors 
capable of realtime DSP. This has led to consumer applications 
for amateur music making such as the Ocarina [30].  
The widespread availabili ty of NIME hardware and software in 
convenient portable form factors has led to the creation of 
groups and ensembles. In the field of academic and 
experimental music, we have seen a proliferation of mobile 
phone orchestras [41]. 
5.2 Mobile Instruments 
We apply the above principles in guiding the design of musical 
instrument performance systems built on the iPhone mobile 
phone. We draw upon Wang and Essl’s notion that the mobile 
phone has robust potential to be a musical instrument by virtue 
of it having sensor input, signal processing capability, and 
sound output on a single device. While Essl  seeks to  c r e a t e  
generic instruments, we were interested in looking at specific 
configurations of the hardware and associated software to create 
distinctive instruments wit h specific modes of musical 
articulation.  
An advanced mobile phone such as the iPhone is a compelling 
musical instrument for its various sensing modes:  
• Multitouch screen 
• 3D accelerometer 
• Audio input 
• GPS 
• Compass 
• Camera 
It has network capability and signal processing capability. The 
Audio input can be used in several modes: 1) to treat audio, as 
in Wessel/Wright’s Catch and Throw s c e n a r i o ,  2 )  a s  a  b r e a t h  
sensor as in Wang’s Ocarina, and 3) as a data acquisition 
channel for auxiliary sensors, as in Jo’s Inaudible Computing  
[23]. 
With Marek Bereza [ 2] we have experimented with use of the 
camera and the multi -touch screen. By placing one’s hand over 
the camera, we could get a very rough approximation of the 
distance of the hand through image luminosity. The auto-
exposure feature of the camera is har dwired and could not be 
overridden, and ultimately defeated the use of camera as 
luminosity sensor.  
Bereza’s SampleToy implements granular synthesis controlled 
by the multi -touch screen. Each point detected on the mul ti-
touch screen played a voice of the granular synthesizer, with X -
axis modulating the time stretching, and the Y -axis the pitch. 
We can apply the tri -partite mapping model from above here , to 
consider that the Binary mapping was the presence of a point on  
the multi- touch screen activatin g a synthesizer voice, with 
sliding on the Y-axis setting the Basic mapping of pitch, and the 
X-axis being the expressive mapping of time stretching.   
The multiple sensing modes of the iPhone make it apt for 
multimodal interaction. The different modalities we have 
experimented with include  
• Use of GPS and compass  
• Simultaneous use of touchscreen and accelerometer  
• Simultaneous use of multiple iPhones by one 
performer 
With Bernhard Garnicnig we have been experimenting with use 
of the GPS for geographic location alongside the compass to 
detect orientation. We have been implementing a prior  locative 
audio w o r k ,  Craving, initially realized on computer based 
systems [16] spatializing a theatre text according to 
latitude/longitude and r a d i a l  o r i e n t a t i o n .  E x t e n s i o n s  t o  t h i s  
include the addition of accelerometer data to couple local 
motion with the cruder location data of the GPS. In this way, 
high frequency accelerometer data can serve to trigger the 
Binary mapping to activate a line in  t h e  s c r i p t ,  w i t h  G P S  
location giving the Basic mapping of determining which line, 
and orientation giving the Expressive mapping of binaural 
spatialization. 
With Adam Parkinson we have been using the Pure Data 
implementation on iPhone, RJDJ to create conce rt performance 
instruments. These have focused on performance modes 
allowing one-handed playing. This came out of the observation 
that most modes of touchscreen interaction with the iPhone 
involve two hands. In the case of the multi-touch interaction 
with SampleToy, for example, in order to take advantage of the 
multi-touch interaction, one hand needs to hold the device while 
multiple fingers on the other hand articulate synthesis voices. In 
the instruments created by Parkinson,  the accelerometer is used 
in c o n j u n c t i o n  w i t h  t h e  t o u c h s c r e e n  w h e r e  b u t t o n s  o n s c r e e n  
activate individual sounds (Binary mapping), sliders set Basic 
mapping parameters such as granular synthesis grain size, 
leaving the X and Y tilt of the accelerometer to modulate 
Expressive mappings of pitch and time stretching. These 
instruments can be played by one hand grasping the iPhone, 
with the thumb manipulating the touchscreen one parameter at a 
time, and with hand and wrist motion performing the 
accelerometer. This creates a compelling performance gesture 
which becomes all the more dynamic with the use of two such 
instruments, one in each hand.  
6. DISCUSSION 
The iPhone/RJDJ instrument developed with Adam Parkinson 
provides a working system to apply the concepts of mapping 
and affordance. The sys tem has been used in live performance 
contexts where each performer in a duo has a device in each 
hand, creating a four-hand iPhone performance.  
Proceedings of the 2010 Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME 2010), Sydney, Australia

A granular synthesis patch is controlled by the device’s 
accelerometer and touch screen using the following ma ppings: 
• X tilt – time stretching 
• Y tilt – pitch 
• On-screen buttons – sample and preset select  
• On-screen sliders – pitch quantization, grain duration  
• X-Y on -screen control – f i l t e r  c u t o f f  f r e q u e n c y  a n d  
resonance 
Using the mapping types from Section 4.2, the buttons can be 
thought of as activation mappings, the sliders as articulation 
mappings, and the accelerometer as modulation mappings. 
These are controlled by a single hand grasping the object with 
the thumb manipulating the on screen interface.  
The use of screen interaction and object manipulation together 
in one hand lends to integrated, compound gestures to articulate 
sound. These gestural components are captured through two 
independent input modes, creating a form of multi- modal 
interaction. 
The system has distinguishing instrumental qualities in that it is 
a graspable object that is at once sensor input device and sound 
synthesis device. In this, input and output modes coincide and 
represent a case of Fishkin’s full embodiment. 
In order to broach issues of affordance, we must consider both 
the physical object as well as its software based sound synthesis 
capabilities. Norman’s use of affordance is useful to understand 
the instrument’s origins as a consumer electronics device. Its 
form factor make a graspable device that can be operated with 
one hand. The touch screen affords tactile interaction, of which 
our software affords a certain subset of all possible interaction. 
The use of sliders and an X -Y on screen control afford single 
touch, and not multi-touch interaction. 
Culturally, the iPhone is an iconic device  that affords 
communications (as a telephone) and music listening (as a 
personal music player). Rather than play upon these cultural 
associations and constraints, we imbue the device with sonic 
affordances that afford forms of gestural, musical expression 
not typically associated with the device as product.  
Gaver’s distinction of perceptible and hidden affordances can 
be applied here – p e r c e p t i b l e  a f f o r d a n c e s  b e i n g  t h e  p r o p e r t i e s  
generally associated with the iPhone as consumer device, and 
hidden affordances being the sound synthesis capabilities 
programmed in using the RJDJ software. The performer on the 
instrument draws upon both types of affordances. The spectator 
at a concert, on the other hand, begins with expectations 
conditioned by the perceptible affordances and discovers the 
musical expression afforded by the hidden affordances, 
contributing to the concert experience. This ultimately 
leverages the compound invariants of Gibson in a dynamic of 
exteroception channeled through proprioception.  
With this we arrive at a characteritic of musical performance 
that take affordance beyond the single -user orientation of 
Norman, Gaver, and Gibson. Musical affordance is situated in 
music as a social, public activity. Affordance the instrument 
provides in this case concerns not just the primary user, the 
performer, but also the audience as observer and perceiver. The 
instrument in the first instance must afford expressive musical 
action to the performer at the  s a m e  t i m e  t h a t  i t  a f f o r d s  
communicable musical articulation in a concert setting. These 
two levels of affordance are conditioned by form factor, 
embodiment, and cultural association. This opens up a rich area 
for further investigation.  
7. CONCLUSIONS 
The self-contained nature of a mobile device for Essl and Wang 
bring the computer music instrument closer to a traditional 
instrument. Meanwhile the position of an acoustical instrument 
as gold standard is put in question by O verholt, Roads, and 
Thompson [28 ] who  o b s e r v e  t h a t  e l e c t r o n i c  i n s t r u m e n t s  a r e  
distinct from traditional instruments in the multiple timescales 
on which they operate, and the breadth of parametric control 
that is possible and often required.  
While not confronting the relative merits of acoustical 
instruments as compared to computer -based instruments, we 
can take qualities of embodiment a s  d e f i n e d  b y  F i s h k i n  a s  a  
way to look at the expressive potential of an instrument, and 
define types of musical gesture and the mappings that can 
support those gestures to define the musical capabilities of a 
digital, computer music performance i nstrument. 
The autonomous, standalone quality – the embodied nature – of 
a mobile instrument allows specific, possibly indiosyncratic, 
mappings to be implemented. In this, the hardware itself may 
remain a general purpose device, and the underlying software  
framework may be generic, but the instantiation of these 
resources in the form of an instrument are specific for any given 
musical situation. We can draw upon Gibson’s theory of 
affordance [18], and the n o t i o n  o f  constraint [ 25] to conclude 
that this distinctness creates a form of musical affordance that is 
propitious to entrainment, and therefore intuitive 
expressiveness.
