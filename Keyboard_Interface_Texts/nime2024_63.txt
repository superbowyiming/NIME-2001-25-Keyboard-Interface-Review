ABSTRACT
The discourse around creative AI is populated by eerie and
otherwordly presences, often evoked by artists to reflect
on the social and cultural challenges that this technology
embodies. This tendency of AI art to bring forth the un-
canny, also emerging in my design and performative work
with NIMEs, echoes the methods of an artistic movement
known as sonic hauntology. In this paper I elaborate on Der-
rida’s and Fisher’s notion of hauntology, a theoretical frame-
work investigating ontology’s liminalities, and an artistic
current addressing the paradoxes of postmodernity through
the magnification of the technological uncanny. I then apply
this paradigm to creative AI, arguing that the model’s al-
gorithmic manipulation of the training data reproduces and
exponentially accelerates the processes of temporal and se-
mantic flattening that characterise postmodern aesthetics.
The frictions produced by creative AI as it operates with
and within the culture bring forth hauntological disjunc-
tures, that artists might harness as an instrument of cri-
tique and scholars as a novel epistemic method. Finally, I
introduce AI hauntography, a practice-based methodology
combining artistic practice and observation to investigate
the phenomenological aspects of creative AI as they inter-
sect with the broader technical and sociopolitical discourse.

chine learning (ML) community explanations usually refer
to the reasons behind the model’s outputs in classification
and prediction tasks [6], beyond such domain XAI extends
to “everything that makes ML models transparent and un-
derstandable” [24], encompassing both the technology and
the broader context in which it is deployed [26, 29].
In the arts, according to Bryan-Kinns et al. XAI provides
an “insightful counterpoint to more functional explanations
of AI” [6]. Explanations encompass here the embodied un-
derstanding of a system as we navigate it, rather than the
plain, causal accounts of its workings [1], its material affor-
dances [33], glitches included [22], as integral to the work of
art, and even concerns regarding AI’s energy consumption
and the ethics of data collection [21].
In line with this, Arora and Sarkar critique a narrow view
of XAI in the arts by noticing that, since art is concerned
with the sublime, explanations become ornamental to the
artistic intention; this anthropocentric perspective of XAI
should be replaced with the notion of sense-making, in-
tended as a relational and immanent “system of echoes, of
resumptions and resonances” [3].
These contributions add to a growing corpus of research,
within and beyond the arts, which frames XAI past the mere
understanding of the model’s workings, whose algorithmic
opaqueness, rather than the definitive problem to solve, may
be viewed under certain conditions as a gate to a different
episteme.
Indeed, as engineering research focuses on breaking the
black box, artists are actively engaging with its fundamen-
tal (and perhaps irreducible) opacity, and building on the
unexplainable, the ambiguous and the uncanny, playfully
re-enact the paradoxes that constitute the technical and
cultural phenomenon of creative AI.
This process is at work, for instance, in Dadabots’s cease-
less real-time musical ruminations,1 in Herndon’s Godmother,
merging oblique vocal reconstructions, eerie percussive sounds
and close-ups of the artist’s face as viewed by a machinic ob-
server,2 and, in the symbolic domain, in Carr´ e’s summoning
of Irving Berlin’s and Cole Porter’s creepy doppelg ¨angers.3
Similarly, in NIME design Hexorcismo’s Semilla.ai (Fig-
ure 1) combines computer vision, neural audio synthesis,
and the Meso-american practice of maize seeds divination;
Donnarumma interacts instead with uncannily autonomous
prostheses,4 Shepardson’s Living Looper reimagines the gui-
tar looper into a living agent [36], and Gioti’s online-learning
system evokes fears of machinic substitution haunting a
group of singers with their sonic remnants. 5
A certain spectrality has emerged in practice as well. I

began my research on XAI in design and artistic practice
by composing systems [32] around the peculiar affordances
of neural audio synthesis algorithms [8]. As I iteratively en-
gaged with them, I became increasingly aware of the models’
statistical rumination of the source material and interested
in the processes that this activates in designers, artists and
listeners.
I began building my NIMEs and artworks, at first inad-
vertently, upon the subtle sense of eeriness that this mech-
anism tends to bring about, querying the dataset’s ghosts
with interfaces based on hidden magnets [31, 33], incorpo-
rating drawings of ancient Icelandic spells [30], and overlap-
ping creepy human voices with otherworldly, dreary sonic
presences [28].
With these hauntings in mind, I began exploring the
wider debate around AI, realising that the eeriness I no-
ticed in my and other artists’ works, within and beyond the
IIL experimental ecosystem, parallels with the summoning
in the political, technical and aesthetic discourse of ghosts
of different kinds: some of these are metaphorical, lurking
behind the disembodied authorship of AI co-creation [13],
some bear the signs of the human labour that sustains the
technology,6 and others, ethereal and ubiquitous, haunt the
web through the viral diffusion of improbable narratives. 7
One might here extend Arthur C. Clarke’s well-known
quote, arguing that even though sufficiently advanced tech-
nologies may be indistinguishable from magic, they sooner
or later stabilise within the culture turning into something
less of a mystery and more of a tool. But even though
the disruptive novelty of the technology, coupled with the
tendency towards the otherworldly of modern media [7] un-
doubtedly contributes to the emergence of spectres of differ-
ent kinds, another mechanism might be at play with genera-
tive AI, one that echoes the instances of a short-lived, inho-
mogeneous aesthetic movement formalised by Mark Fisher
under the umbrella term sonic hauntology [14].
In this paper I elaborate on this insight, framing the dis-
course on hauntology from Derrida to Fisher, and exploring
its application to creative musical AI and within my own
work with NIMEs. This will help us delineate the practice-
based methodology of AI hauntography, a research method
based on a perspective on XAI as sense-making [3], com-
bining musical performance, and observation to investigate
the phenomenology of creative AI as it manifests in our in-
strument designs and the broader social context.

2. HAUNTOLOGY
The notion of hauntology traces back to Derrida, as yet an-
other pun in his deconstructive arsenal (in French, “hauntol-
ogy” is indeed a homophone to “ontology”) extending his ex-
ploration of the ontologically liminal to individual and col-
lective existential history. Indeed, in his Spectres of Marx,
Derrida introduces the idea of a broken historicity, or, by
summoning Hamlet’s ghost, of an “out-of-jointness” perme-
ating the neo-liberal ideology [12].
In deeming Fukuyama’s claim of history coming to an
end with the crisis of the Soviet Union [17] as neo-evangelic
rhetoric, and as such ideology in disguise, Derrida argues
that Marxism was a spectre in the first place, a ghost haunt-
ing Europe since the incipit of the Communist Manifesto.
It is within the paradoxes inherent to the repression of
historical time programmed into the neo-capitalist cultural
hegemony, in the “out-of-jointness” caused by the historical
impossibility of neoliberalism’s self-proclaimed universality,
that Derrida’s notion of hauntology finds its foundation.
This existential haunting is the fundamental condition
of postmodernity, the cultural logic of neo-liberal society,
characterised by a generalised scepticism towards the past,
the disavowal of 20th century grand narratives, and a gener-
alised sense of loss in the stability of meaning [25]. Postmod-
ernism, argues Jameson, subverts and flattens time through
a nostalgia mechanism, a pervasive phenomenon in the post-
Fordist cultural production, ceaselessly enacting a stereo-
typed, fictional past through the recovery and juxtaposition
of its voided simulacra [20].
This “nostalgia mode” is symptomatic of a cultural fold-
ing, a deceleration in the evolution of artistic creation all
the more evident if compared to the exponential increase
in the pace of technical innovation. Nostalgia’s concurrent
processes of re-actualisation and neurotic iteration of a fic-
tional past offer the most pristine example of the kind of
spectres hauntology is concerned with: the subtle eeriness,
the uneasiness, the paradoxical disjunctures that this self-
referential delusion brings about are viewed, through the
hauntological lenses, as symptoms of a profound chasm,
liminal traces confronting us with the impossibility of a fu-
ture without a reconciliation with the ghosts haunting the
present.
ˇZiˇ zek effectively epitomizes the hauntological process that
comes into play with nostalgia, when, interpreting Marx
and Freud, he writes that “the way to the truth of a system
(of society, of the psyche) leads through what necessarily
appears as a pathological, marginal and accidental distor-
tion of this system, [such as] slips of the tongue, dreams,
symptoms, economic crises” [37]: nostalgia’s paradoxical
pastiche, precisely when it aims for its own legitimisation,
brings forth a ghost: through the manifest historical impos-
sibility of its naturalisation, the postmodern is revealed as
ideology in disguise, as the “reflex and the concomitant of
yet another systemic modification of capitalism itself” [20].
Such is the nature of hauntological spectres. They are
otherworldly insofar as they reveal the obscenity of the
mundane, alien insofar as they uncover the alien in the
familiar. Their haunting operates in two distinct ways:
first, by bringing to the surface what ideology removes from
perception (the relics of the unfulfilled postmodern termi-
nal prophecy, first and foremost); second, they reveal that
which never came to be (the spectre of Communism, in
Derrida’s original framing) and yet, as an acting void keeps
operating against the current ideology by virtue of its very
absence [12].
2.1 Sonic Hauntology
Fisher’s musical aesthetics find their foundations in the in-
tegration of Derrida’s notion of hauntology with Jameson’s
nostalgia mode.
In Metaphysics of Crackle, the author introduces the work
of a small group of British musicians and producers at the
beginning of the 21st century, whom he identifies as “sonic
hauntologists” [15]. This group of artists, including William
Basinski, The Caretaker, and the producers of the British
Ghost Box Label, exposes, denounces and subverts the post-
modern loss of meaning by magnifying the subtle uncanni-
ness that is inherent to the nostalgia mechanism.
Sonic hauntologists activate this process in two distinct
ways: on the temporal plane, by overlapping sonic rem-
nants from distant aesthetics with electronic sounds from
the second half of the 20th Century into dream-like, desta-
bilising soundscapes; on the ontological plane, by overlap-
ping phonographic remnants such as hiss, white noise, clicks
and crackles, onto the transparency of the modern digital
medium. This process, according to Fisher, unsettles “the
very distinction between surface and depth, between back-
ground and foreground,” and reveals the technical frame of
the recording substrate that disappeared from the listeners’
awareness with the advent of the digital.
Through these two mechanisms, nostalgia is both mag-
nified and reversed: “Whereas [the latter] glosses over the
temporal disjunctures, the hauntological artists foreground
them by displacing the longing towards the futures that
never came to be as a consequence of postmodernity’s ter-
minal temporality” [15]. In other words, by enacting the
same processes by which the postmodern reproduces its own
void, sonic hauntologists imagine (and mourn) the futures
that never came to be, thus exorcising the postmodern im-
plicit assumptions of universalism.
Fisher’s metaphysics parallels Derrida’s critique of the
metaphysics of presence, wherein meaning is assigned and
interpreted in relation to a body, that is, a body in the
“now.” By complementing ontology rather than opposing
it, sonic hauntologists focus on absence and ambiguity, as
their sonic spectres (dis)embody presence and absence be-
yond their opposing significations, and through the tempo-
ral paradoxes of the phonographic remnant haunt the exclu-
sion of absence that is foundational to ontological thought.
This focus on ambiguity and absence finds a compelling par-
allel with generative AI, in that the processes by which it
models and mobilises human experience are founded upon
a novel and unprecedented disruption of presence.
3. AI HAUNTOLOGY
A striking example of Fisher’s hauntological aesthetics as
applied to creative AI may be found in Petr Valek’s AI-
generated post-communist landscapes, haunted by anthro-
pomorphic tractors, uncanny retrofuturistic aliens and eerie
folklore creatures posing motionless for a non-existent ob-
server. In these faded photographs, time seems to halt and
space to fold, recombining distant causalities into zoomor-
phic agro-technological beings, suspended concrete struc-
tures hosting eerie creatures, cryptids holding hands with
hooded kids and Afrofuturistic nightmares haunting bare
Eastern-European landscapes.8
But it is in the sonic domain that Fisher’s spectres are ex-
plicitly reframed into the AI discourse, with Rubinstein in-
dicating AI-generated music as the natural heir of the sonic
hauntology movement [35]. Rubinstein postulates that sim-
ilarly to how sonic hauntology’s eeriness stems from how it
8https://www.instagram.com/the.vape.noise/
Figure 2: Petr Valek, 2023
uses new technology to “remediate older sonic artefacts in
ways that deliberately upset how the past is usually repre-
sented,”generative AI reassembles the timeline of the source
material in novel, eerie ways, and, through temporal dis-
junctures and logical discontinuities re-enacts the contra-
dictions hiding underneath capitalism’s a-temporalities.
If sonic hauntologists achieve the technological uncanny
through the reconfiguration and juxtaposition of past aes-
thetics and the deliberate exposure of the medium, in AI-
generated music temporal uncertainties and sonic anachro-
nisms emerge as direct emanations of the algorithm’s inner
workings, independently and sometimes beyond the user’s
intentions. Through this mechanism, a technology often
(and with good reasons) seen as the embodiment of techno-
capitalist accelerationism and greed for power centralisation
might potentially be reconfigured as a favourable terrain for
the emergence of a new critique, that might be harnessed by
artists against the shallowness of the post-modern pastiche.
The idea of a hauntological potential intrinsic to AI echoes
what Parisi defines as an alien subject, a space of think-
ing beyond the “servo-mechanic model of cybernetics” con-
fronting a human-centred notion of cognition [27] and, ac-
cording to Coleman, “in opposition to the reproduction of
the same”[10]. Yet, as we have seen in Section 2, hauntolog-
ical disjunctures operate as acting voids, they are subjectiv-
ities without subject, aliens only insofar as they inhabit the
human. In other words, extending Calvino’s far-seeing re-
flections on the possibility of cybernetic literature machines,
AI spectres emerge “only if the (...) machine is surrounded
by the hidden ghosts of the individual and of his society”
[9].
Calvino deemed the ability of his speculative literary ma-
chines to recombine human knowledge as valuable in that,
by operating beyond the cultural and political constraints
of hegemonic thinking, they intersect the collective uncon-
scious thus bringing about new forms of understanding; yet,
little did he know that the cybernetic systems he was imag-
ining would have been designed to model and statistically
reconfigure the same knowledge he wished to expand, ulti-
mately reproducing the very biases and cultural norms that
constitute those boundaries.
To frame AI’s hauntological agency within such techno-
cultural boundaries, we therefore need to return to hauntol-
ogy’s Derridean roots, wherein the ghost, rather than from
a deliberate expressive intent or an intrinsic property of
the system, emerges as a side-effect of the reality check be-
tween the system’s workings and the zeitgeist. Extending
ˇZiˇ zek’s quote, the hauntological in AI arises from the ma-
chinic slips of tongue, the hallucinations, and the temporal
and causal disjunctures that emerge as the system operates
with, within and against the culture, as the quintessential
embodiment and exponential magnification of the postmod-
ern pastiche into the 21st century.
If nostalgia re-enacts the paradoxes of capitalism as it re-
configures human existential history, generative AI’s work-
ings accelerate this process into a paroxysmal agential void,
a ceaseless friction of human culture against itself. This
mechanism produces a subtle sense of eeriness that conceals,
and precisely by concealing betrays, hauntological disjunc-
tures that might point to unresolved areas in our under-
standing of AI as a cultural phenomenon, and reveal the
“conjurations,” in Derrida’s terms, behind our instrument
designs’ ontologies. In my practice, I activate and investi-
gate these traces through the method of AI hauntography.
4. THE HAUNTOGRAPHIC METHOD
In the same way as hauntology complements ontology by
extending its reach beyond the dualisms of presence and
absence, hauntography may be seen as complementary to
ontography, a methodology formalised by scholars from the
Object Oriented Ontology (OOO) school of thought.
Harman assigns to ontography the task of dealing with
the “limited number of dynamics that can occur between
different things” [18], and Bogost frames it as the “rev-
elation of object relationship without necessarily offering
clarification of any kind”[5]. Examples are verbal and vi-
sual lists, exploded views and ontographic machines such as
video games mapping abstract gestures to encyclopedic ac-
counts of things. Beyond OOO, ontographs acquire slightly
different nuances, such as in the case of Kuhn’s graphical
notations, depicting units within self-contained worlds.
On the other hand, the notion of hauntography has seen
little to no theoretical formalisation as of yet. Whereas
some use it as a synonym for spirit photography, namely
the practice of taking photographs of moving subjects with
prolonged exposure, Rich’s Shipwreck Hauntography is by
far the main academic formalisation of the concept. Within
the field of shipwreck archaeology, Rich defines the haunto-
graph as the “ontograph for the revenant,” in clear conti-
nuity with the discussed ontology-hauntology dualism, and
hauntography as the speculative practice of “imagin[ing] the
uncanny spatial and temporal ambiguities and tensions of
a liminal object that is both present and absent” [34].
OOO’s open critique of anthropocentrism makes it a fit-
ting framework for a methodology involving humans, tech-
nological artefacts and liminal entities such as spectres; yet,
as Frauenberger points out, OOO tends to dismiss relation-
ships and interactions as ontologically relevant [16]. As we
have seen in Section 3, hauntology is instead intrinsically
relational, since its disjunctures emerge out of paradoxical
overlappings between distant temporal and semantic planes
and through frictions within complex social and technical
assemblages.
I therefore view hauntography as complementary to other
post-humanist ontologies such as Barad’s agential realism
and Latour’s Actor-Network theory (ANT) [23], sharing
with the former the radical relational take on the intra-
active generation of meaning and matter, whilst incorpo-
rating in my practice the precise methodological approach
of the latter (See 4.1).
Whereas in Barad’s onto-epistemology being and knowing
are fundamentally inseparable [4], in the case of hauntogra-
phy knowledge is inseparable from ontology’s hauntological
shadow. This direct epistemic scope is where my framing of
hauntography differs from Rich’s, in that instead of “imag-
ining and reflecting upon temporal tensions and ambigui-
ties,” we activate and magnify their sub-liminal manifesta-
tions within the subject. Based on this premise, we may
define the components of the hauntological investigation as
follows:
• Hauntogram: A conceptual construct encompassing
the unresolved tensions, echoes and resonances that
are liminal to the ontology of a subject.
• Hauntological Trace: An observable manifestation of
the hauntogram. A construct embodying the subjec-
tively and objectively sensible effects of a hauntogram
as it operates with and within a given sociocultural
system.
• Hauntography: The practice-based activation of the
hauntogram through the iterative incorporation, mag-
nification and observation of the hauntological traces
it produces.
• Hauntograph: The theoretical and/or practice-based
outcome of the hauntographic process.
4.1 AI hauntography
Hauntography is essentially a practice-based methodology
and, therefore, it is highly dependent on the researcher’s
area of expertise and expressive means. The methods used
to activate and incorporate the hauntological in one’s work
and the qualitative approaches to data collection and anal-
ysis should reflect this, thus varying depending on subject,
discipline and context. This methodological flexibility al-
lows the researcher to dynamically adapt and respond to the
hauntogram’s inherent ontological instability. Yet, within
this malleability, a few constants allow us to delineate with
reasonable certainty what AI hauntography is and is not:
• As we engage in AI hauntography, we activate and
magnify the hauntological to deconstruct the ontolog-
ical solidity of the subject. One way of doing this
with creative AI is by applying the methods of sonic
hauntologists: by magnifying AI’s hauntological traces
(See 2.1) we reveal the statistical flattening of the
source material and the processes activated by its al-
gorithmic manipulation.
• By activating these spectral processes, we reconfigure
our understanding of the subject. In the case of cre-
ative AI, this implies both a creative subversion and a
theoretical reframing of issues such as agency, author-
ship, and intent.
• As we engage in these processes, we embed our think-
ing in new, hauntologically-inspired artistic works and
technical objects (interfaces, AI models, artworks), in
themselves epistemic tools within a rhizomatic process
of knowledge production.
In my practice with NIMEs, I complement hauntography
with the analytical tools of ANT, since this framework has
been frequently combined with practice-based research and
provides a rigorous yet flexible approach to the qualitative
analysis of sociotechnical assemblages [23].
Indeed, ANT attributes the role of actant to any element
in a given network, be it human, machinic, or merely con-
ceptual, as long as it plays a part in the negotiations and
transformations of the system. Another advantage of ANT
as applied to AI hauntography is that actants are viewed
as a temporary assemblage of multiple actors, depending
on the level of abstraction that is functional to the anal-
ysis. This allows us to follow the hauntological traces as
they move in between different networks and musical as-
semblages, and as they ripple into the social.
As we slowly navigate from a micro to a macro perspec-
tive, we may transition from what Latour defines as soci-
ology of associations to the broader sociology of the social
[23]. Examples of the latter are the tools offered by spectral
ethnography, where traces emerge in ghost texts as invisible
dialogues between people and their material surroundings
[2], by critical heritage practices searching for colonial traces
inside a culture’s artefacts, and critical Marxist theory, in
which hauntology was first conceived.
4.2 AI Hauntography in Practice
In Latour’s words, “ANT is a painstakingly slow process,”
and hauntography inherits and multiplies this property by
extending the analysis of a single network to the transfor-
mations occurring as the trace translates from one network
to another. We must therefore defer this exercise to fu-
ture works, wherein, having established a solid theoretical
framework, we will dig into the hauntological processes of
specific sociotechnical systems and musical assemblages.
Nevertheless, to better contextualise this framework, it
is worth introducing two, intertwined macro-areas where
AI’s hauntological traces have emerged in my practice with
NIMEs, ultimately leading me to formulate the ideas dis-
cussed herein: one regarding the architecture’s internal work-
ings, and one concerning the frictions of the model with the
broader social context.
The former type of trace is produced by the negotia-
tions between AI’s inherently twofold algorithmic and data-
driven nature. Generalising, whereas our experience of sub-
ject, background, sound, timbre and structure is contextual
and holistic, AI architectures have little to no understand-
ing of context, and model a limited amount of features from
the dataset they are trained with; in addition, since they are
designed to recognise patterns, AI algorithms learn correla-
tions where causation is not necessarily present [11]. The
list may extend, encompassing other model-specific con-
straints, the methodologies applied for the curation of the
dataset, and the process of training, all contributing to the
generation of partial and decontextualised outputs that ul-
timately produce the sense of out-of-jointness, the techno-
logical uncanny from which the hauntological arises.
This first process of trace-making was evident as I per-
formed with Stacco (Figure 3), a NIME developed with Gi-
acomo Lepri and based on neural synthesis [8]. Stacco fea-
tures a series of magnetic sensors and attractors under a
wooden board, on top of which the performer throws and
displaces magnetic spheres of variable dimensions. Due to
its shape and to the peculiar interaction design, Stacco re-
minds of an Ouija board with whom the performer playfully
summons the sonic spectres lurking within the model.
By building on this metaphor, I developed Mouja (Figure3),
a performance in which I theatrically explore multiple, over-
lapping neural synthesis models and the liminal, unpopu-
lated areas in their latent spaces. In Mouja, unintelligible
vocal reconstructions bear the traces of the model’s rumina-
tion, vinyl crackles emerge from old organ sounds, granular
choirs whisper uncanny phonemes, and the distant tempo-
ral planes of the source material, rather than fading behind
processes of algorithmic interpolation, confront the viewers
with their incongruous juxtapositions.
A second, higher-level process of trace-making is instead

at play in the system’s mobilisation of the data: the active
reconfiguration of knowledge, performed in response to the
user’s inputs. Hauntological traces emerge here beyond the
duality of dataset and algorithm; we may see these as meta-
remnants, so to say, in that instead of bringing forth the
technological substrate or the spectral partiality of the data,
through the agency of the interface they evoke their human
simulacra.
The hauntological disjuncture at play here is between the
presence of a disembodied form of knowledge and the ab-
sence that such disembodiment brings forth. The traces
that this produces depend on a multiplicity of contextual
and cultural factors, such as the degree of agency of the
system, the context in which it operates, the methodologies
applied for curating the data and the user’s acquaintance
with it. In a way, generative AI is here seen as a medium
in disguise, although one endowed with a high degree of
agency [19].
These traces arose with striking evidence as I worked on
an installation in Nelson, Lancashire, for the British Textile
Biennial with artist Eva Sajovic (Figure 4). For this work,
exploring participatory practice and cultural heritage, we
created four interactive e-textile columns, embedding speak-
ers in each of them and around the structure, thus turning
the installation into a large-scale musical instrument. We
then trained four RAVE [8] models with machinic and nat-
ural soundscapes collected by people from the community
in a series of workshops around the abandoned mills, and
assigned a model to each of the columns.
Before the training, I spent time interviewing the partici-
pants, asking the reasons behind their choices in the record-
ing phase, associating sounds with places, places with sto-
ries, and stories with people. Once I activated the models,
I found myself immersed in the overlapping, disembodied
remnants of those stories and people, echoing the commu-
nity’s lived experience and interpersonal bonds. The man-
ifest absence of the subjects, that is, the acting bodies of
the people who contributed to the work, brought forth the
hauntological acting void (See 2), re-enacting and magnify-
ing the processes of human displacement and technological
substitution that have been shaping this area and its people
since the first industrial revolution.

5. CONCLUSIONS
This contribution delineates a broad picture of hauntology,
encompassing those spectral, critical and aesthetic theories
that question and complement the metaphysics of presence.
Derrida’s notion of hauntology turns presence into a con-
juration, and the subject into the simulacrum of its un-
fulfilled promises, threatened by forces operating through
their very absence. Creative AI embodies the hauntological
through the exponential acceleration of nostalgia’s processes
of juxtaposition and de-signification of the source material.
The frictions that this mechanism produces as it oper-
ates with and within the culture bring forth the technologi-
cal uncanny, the Shakespearean “out-of-jointness,” the sen-
sible trace of a hauntological disjuncture. AI hauntography
leverages this mechanism: it subverts nostalgia to reveal the
hauntological processes hidden behind such disjunctures. In
practice, this may be done by applying the methods of sonic
hauntologists, that is, by revealing the processes of tempo-
ral flattening and semantic depletion of the source material,
and by reflecting on the outcomes.
Even though this paper formalizes the method of hauntog-
raphy to investigate AI, it is nonetheless possible to extend
this framework beyond this domain, and, with appropriate
adaptations, apply it to the broader fields of NIME design
and HCI practices.
Indeed, Derrida’s hauntology is fundamentally a decon-
structive method, which can be reframed to explore the im-
plicit history of designed objects, to investigate their onto-
logical porosity, to re-interpret design decisions and bring
forth hidden assumptions, to understand how our systems
adapt to the culture and reveal the traces of such adapta-
tions.
This epistemic scope makes hauntography a unique method-
ology in supplementing ontological thinking, and it frames
it as an ideal strategy to make sense of the technical, social
and cultural phenomenon of creative AI.
