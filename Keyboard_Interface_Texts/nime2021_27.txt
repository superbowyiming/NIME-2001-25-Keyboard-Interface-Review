ABSTRACT
This paper presents the soma design process of creating Body Electric: a novel 
interface for the capture and use of biofeedback signals and physiological changes 
generated in the body by breathing, during singing. This NIME design is grounded in 
the performer's experience of, and relationship to, their body and their voice. We show 
that NIME design using principles from soma design can offer creative opportunities in 
developing novel sensing mechanisms, which can in turn inform composition and 
further elicit curious engagements between performer and artefact, disrupting notions 
of performer-led control. As contributions, this work 1) offers an example of NIME 
design for situated living, feeling, performing bodies, and 2) presents the rich potential 
of soma design as a path for designing in this context.

1. Introduction
The development and commercial availability of biofeedback sensors, such as 
electrocardiograms (ECG) and electromyograms (EMG), has seen the increased usage 
of these technologies within an artistic context over the last 60 years [1]. The creative 
appropriation of biosensors has resulted in the development of new musical interfaces 
which harness biosignals, spatial and gestural data to either sonify the body, control 
and trigger sound events, or to manipulate the sound of acoustic instruments. Some 
prominent artists working with these technologies such as Marco Donnarumma, Atau 
Tanaka, Pamela Z and Imogen Heap, have approached the design of their NIMEs and 
digital instruments for sonifying their bodies through harnessing electrical signals 
from muscles and/or the brain—in Donnarumma and Tanaka’s work— [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 
[7], or—as with Z and Heap— through sonifying  gestural data [8] [9][10] [11] [12] [13] 
[14] [15] [16].
However, there appears to be a gap in the design of interfaces for controlling and 
processing vocal sound. Although there is notable ongoing work and research in voice

and the application of biofeedback and biosensing technologies, a significant majority 
is geared towards discovering how the expressivity of a singer’s gestures (typically 
their hands) can be harnessed to process their sound according to sonification 
mappings based on spatial orientation and acceleration of limbs [17][18], or the 
recognition of a gestural vocabulary [19][14][8].  Recent research and applications of 
respiration as a control parameter within NIMEs have seen the development of novel 
interfaces and instruments, and investigated couplings between music control, 
biofeedback and breathing [20], or a dancer’s respiratory influence upon music [21]. 
These works have considered features of respiration, such as air pressure in the mouth 
of wind instrument players [22], periodicity of the breathing cycle and the coupling 
between affective health [20], frequency content of the air stream during extended and 
timbral techniques whilst playing wind instruments [23], and the sonification of 
breathing data within interactive systems during free improvisation [24]. Of most 
connection to this research is Lee and Yeo’s [21] observations on dancers’ respiratory 
connection to the motion of the body, through torso movements.  Building upon this 
connection, this paper explores topographical change in the torso occurring during 
singing, breathing and breathing for singing. At the time of writing, there is a dearth 
of research examining how the physiological processes associated with producing 
vocalised sound - such as respiration - can be harnessed as a means of interacting with 
and processing the voice itself during singing.
Here we present a novel approach to interface design by “turning inwards” to the rich 
bodily information provided during singing, framing the design and creation of a NIME 
within the experience of (or relationship to) the instrument being sensed and designed 
for. By “turning inwards”, we define this as a utilisation of a first-person subjective 
somatic experience as a method to articulating their experience (in this case, singing), 
and further, how the experiential qualities of vocal performance are designed for when 
developing a musical interface. 
The first author, Kelsey, is a classically trained vocalist concerned with the actions 
occurring within her body during performance, and wished to highlight the 
experiential and physiological processes involved in her singing. She wanted to 
compose and perform a piece of music around her interest, and to create an interface 
that emphasised and interacted with the invisible aspects of her vocal production. 
Throughout this paper we will use the term “instrument” to refer to Kelsey’s voice, 
with more general usage of the term framed within the context of usage (ie. other 
musical instruments, digital music instruments) with the terms ‘interface’ or ‘artefact’ 
referring to the Body Electric NIME.

Kelsey’s intention—to place the audience “inside” her bodily experience of singing, and 
thereby draw attention to how she “feels” her instrument and the invisibility of the 
physiological changes within her body (through the intake and flow of her 
breath).Motivated by this, an interface, in the form of an interactive wearable utilising 
novel shape change pressure sensor-actuators to capture breathing biosignal 
information, was designed. This became a sort of co-performer in the resultant 
composition: The Body Electric, created with and through this interface. To design 
this, we drew from soma design strategies aimed at engaging with the felt experience 
of breathing and singing. In soma-based design work, it is important to train somatic 
designerly skills [25] by shaping not only the physical materials used to build our 
artefacts, but also our own movements and sensations as we learn to aesthetically 
appreciate and to articulate the somatic changes and movements occurring when 
singing [26] [27].
This paper documents this autobiographical engagement with Kelsey’s instrument 
through and with this interface and the resulting creation of a wearable artefact to 
record, capture and transmit these biosignals. It further documents the evolving 
relationship and curious entanglements between musician and interface within the 
context of the composed work (The Body Electric) and builds upon an area of interface 
design centred in the musician’s subjective and somatic experience with and through 
their instrument. We discuss the lessons learned when designing musical interfaces 
aimed at co-performing with a singer, as well as challenges and opportunities for 
NIME design when turning inwards, facilitated through soma design methods. 
2. Background
Biosensing Technologies for Sonifying the Body in Artistic Contexts. 
The intersection of biosensing and art has been a progressively developing field as the 
commercial availability of sensors has increased, and so too the rise of DIY/Maker 
culture [1] [28] [29]. Within the NIME community a number of researchers have 
explored the potential of utilising biosensing tools for generating music [30] or for 
designing creative and artistic expressions with data produced by bodies, more 
broadly [31] [32] [33]. Regardless of the type of biosensor used to capture and 
transform physiological data into sound, there is a commonality in that each approach 
is centred around exploring how a musician’s experiences can inform physical 
engagement during performance, and the body’s creative potential as an expressive 
tool [34] [11].

Donnarumma’s description of biophysical music is useful here, which he defines as the 
configuration of computing interfaces with musical systems [35]. We see this definition 
as more effectively accommodating the integration of biosensing and sonification, 
while opening up this design space through providing opportunities to develop new 
technologies and means to record and capture novel human movement during 
performance and music making. Our work takes this definition as a point of departure, 
and explores the torso as an "unconventional" computing interface that provides  
information through the control of Kelsey’s air pressure system, as it changes shape, 
topography, dimension and hardness when she breathes and engages with certain 
muscular regions. Our research process and resulting interface also builds on previous 
work in NIME that has used somaesthetics and soma design methods to open up the 
space of developing musical interfaces [36].
With regards to singing and vocal production within the context of NIME and HCI 
research, there has been notable work [17] [37] [38] [39] [18]. Two who have been 
quite influential to our research, are Pamela Z and Imogen Heap. Both utilise the 
gestural components of their respective performative practices as a means of 
controlling and processing their sound, and as a compositional tool. The vocalist-
composer Pamela Z utilises gestural MIDI controllers, and the data from her hand 
movements is captured and processed using MaxMSP and Isadora software. Singer-
songwriter-engineer Imogen Heap utilises sensors monitoring her body and gestures 
through her Mi-Mu gloves, which capture movement and gestural information using 
flex, motion and orientation sensors, and haptic motors [14]. The data captured 
through Heap’s Mi-Mu gloves is processed using Ableton Software. 
3. Motivation and Vision
Through her experience in singing with various interfaces, controllers and sensors 
(such as Wii remotes, MIDI keyboards, pedals and motion tracking), Kelsey identified 
that these systems requiring gestural activation—mainly through the hands) or 
extraneous movement for motion detection—“pushed” the manipulation of her sound 
outside of her body, disconnecting her from her own practice in the embodied 
manipulation of her own acoustic sound by engaging with her own musculature. This 
was experienced as a de-centralisation of her body as an interface in its own right, and 
the physiological and experiential movements and actions of Kelsey generating a sonic 
action - in this case, the changing topography of her torso and abdominals during 
singing and breathing. To address this potential, a NIME was developed to re-position 
the body as the controller, or interface, for the sound coming out of it and to enable

reflection on the somatic experience of singing through topographical change to the 
torso.
4. Soma Design Approach: Developing a NIME through and with the 
Body
Aiming to achieve the above goals (i.e. design a NIME that would put her bodily 
manipulations at the centre of the experience and explore how to "place" the audience 
inside her body by emphasising the less visible bodily changes she makes during 
singing and breathing) Kelsey turned to soma design, as a method and approach in 
interaction design that puts the focus on designing with and for the body [40]. Soma 
design has its roots in theories of somaesthetics [41] and emphasises becoming 
attentive to, and improving connections between movement, sensation, subjective 
understanding and values. It is building on the designer’s first person perspective of 
aesthetic and sensuous experiences, through which, one can learn to discern and 
harness them, and to devise rich and nuanced interactive experiences at the meeting 
between technologies and bodies. The most common soma design tactics include 
becoming attentive to one’s soma through engaging in bodily practices thoughtfully 
and deliberately, and using estrangement methods [42] for defamiliarising already 
familiar experiences as a path to providing a more nuanced and rich perception of 
bodily experiences. Martinez-Avila et al. [36] were the first to turn to soma design 
methods as a potential route to realising more body-centred and aesthetic musical 
instruments and interfaces. With their concept of breathing guitars, arising through 
their engagement with soma design for NIMEs, they suggest that there is great 
potential for further applying the soma design approach within the NIME community. 
In this paper we draw on this approach and open up the design space of making 
NIMEs that have the body, and the subjective somatic experience of the body, as the 
starting point of departure and as the actual musical interface. We show a process of 
designing the Body Electric NIME—a musical interface that firmly positions the body 
and the experience of breathing while singing—into the heart of the experience of 
performing with it.
5. THE DESIGN PROCESS
5.1 Somatic Experience of Singing
The first step in this design process was turning inwards to Kelsey’s experience of 
singing and examining closely what she observed her body doing during her vocal 
practice, she observed the following breathing phenomena occurring: expansion, multi-

of singing

directional movement and collapse of the torso and thorax. Specifically in the following 
regions: lower abdominals, ribcage, sternum, thoracolumbar fascia (see Figure 1). 
These observations came through Kelsey’s usage of body mapping to track 
physiological changes and become more attentive to her body, disrupting her normal 
breathing exercises by working with different speeds and opposing her body's 
instinctive movements (ie. pulling in during inhalation, and pushing out for exhalation), 
and attuning to experience of breathing. Kelsey’s observations about the parts of her 
body that engage deeply in her singing practice (illustrated below) and affected by her 
topographical manipulation guided the need for sensors capable of registering her 
body changing shape during her breathing, and where these sensors should be placed. 
During Kelsey’s attunement to her body she further observed nuanced experiences of 
how air feels within her body, such as sonic differences in inhaling through her mouth 
versus her nose, textural sounds when she breathes deeply or shallowly, and high or 
low into her body, gurgling of the digestive system as the organs are displaced by 
inhalation, the tactile crackle of saliva in the mouth during singing and the different 
filtering of the voice caused by inner-ear pressure and blocked sinuses. These 
observations influenced Kelsey’s use of sonic material, both as live vocalisation and as 
pre-recorded material.

5.2 Harnessing somatic experience: biosensing sensor-actuator shape 
change pillows
Building upon Kelsey’s somatic understanding of her breathing practice (section 5.1), 
she created a corset structure fitted with 4 pressure sensing pillows for detecting 
topographical bodily changes across 4 points on the body to capture the physiological 
changes she experienced. The internal sensor system was developed in collaboration 
with the co-authors of this paper, who are HCI researchers working at the KTH Royal 
Institute of Technology, and builds on earlier research and artefact design conducted 
in developing novel shape-changing sensors [43].  
These biosensors took the form of shape change sensor-actuator pillows, specifically 
designed to capture the shape-changing qualities of Kelsey’s own body. A single sensor-
actuator consists of an electronics unit with an Arduino micro controller, solenoid 
valves, an air pump and a barometric pressure sensor (see Figure 2 below). The pillow
—made of Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) coated nylon—connects to the air pump 
with transparent tubing. The Arduino micro controller is connected to a computer via 
OSC protocol, with software modules in MaxMSP for controlling the inflation and 
deflation operations of each micro controller. The pillows are coded to respond to 
external crush by deflating, and—after deflating—to slightly re-inflate when not placed 
under any external pressure.  
The pillows were positioned over specific areas (see Figure 1), between Kelsey’s body 
and an external rigid surface. Much like the physical limits imposed by ribcage flexion, 
an external surface to press against the pillows was needed to capture the torso’s 
changing dimension and shape. To facilitate this, Kelsey constructed a hard external

shell which was fitted with the internal pillow sensors (see Figure 3, panels A and B). 
Within the final version of this NIME (Figure 3, panel C) the movements of the body 
and “crush” of the 4 sensors are visible, with changes to Kelsey’s torso topography 
captured via the pressure sensors in the pillows. 
In The Body Electric, the corset functions as an interactive interface which utilises 
biosensing information caused by torso changes (captured through 4 shape change 
sensor-actuator pillows) occurring as a result of singing and breathing. The use of 
these sensor-actuators facilitated a novel experience of engaging with the interface, 
and further re-frames the act of singing as a conscious and deliberate engagement 
with the physiological events occurring  within the body through an interface that 
continually creates a control versus co-performance environment.
5.3 Somatic Singing 
5.3.1 Body Sounds
The specific sound world built in The Body Electric revolves around the internal 
sounds of Kelsey’s instrument as she hears her voice and breath (section 5.1). The 
interactive nature of singing in and with the interface further manipulated her sound 
because she had to “push” out and “hold” her body out more to crush the pillows 
during singing, inviting deeper interoceptive reflection around her breathing. This 
approach led to her elongating the sounds she normally hears during singing, such as 
the micro sounds of air moving in her nasal passages and mouth, the crackle of her 
saliva and the slower displacement and gurgling of organs in her digestive system 
displaced slightly by her breathing. Kelsey used this sonic material to try and “place” 
the audience inside her experience of her air, using these body sounds in a soundscape 
affected by the micro movements of her breathing and muscles. These sounds were 
actual sounds produced live (with amplification), and also as material that was 
recorded for playback and transformation in performance.

5.3.2 Composing with the body, composing with the corset: Through connection, 
disconnection and questioning
The interactive experience of singing in and with the interface further influenced the 
composition. During exploratory sessions wearing the corset, Kelsey examined the 
MaxMSP visualisation of her breathing (from the 4 pressure sensors, see Figure 4) and 
the specific architecture of each biosignal line generated from the pillow sensors. She 
observed during these sessions that there was an interesting correlation between the 
visualisation of the signals and her experience of interaction with the corset: over time 
the physical fatigue she experiences during singing accelerated due to the interactive 
nature of singing inside the artefact, where Kelsey would "push" more during 
inhalation and progressively collapse faster. The "giving out" of her body further led to 
her breathing pattern became progressively more disrupted as her breath 
progressively moved higher into her body, and became more fragmented as she took in 
more air to try and help her “failing” body.  The pillows on the points of her body more 
effected by fatigue (lower abdominals) became less integral to the soundscape when 
they "couldn’t sing anymore". Kelsey drew connections between the visualisation of 
her breathing, and her evolving experience of connection (to her instrument), the 
bodily disconnection experienced after sustained singing in the artefact, and her 
eventual loss of strength and the questioning of “who” was in control of the 
soundscape.

11
The encapsulation of Kelsey’s experience of singing in the corset through these 3 
phases (connection, disconnection and questioning) presents an interesting navigation 
of a control versus co-performance relationship, facilitated by the experience of 
singing with and against the interface. The artefact’s acceleration of Kelsey’s normal 
physical fatigue levels establishes a transference of “control” of the performance 
through the connection with the object she is interacting with, to a disconnection with 
the object—where control is exchanged—and finally reaching a point at which her body 
is no longer capable of  producing the range of motion necessary to interact with the 
machine to "make" it sing (questioning). Control is ceded to the artefact, and it 
transcends its usage as a “thing” to be interacted with - it becomes a sort of 
independent co-performer through it’s impact upon the body and the produced sound, 
and for it’s assumption of control over the soundscape. 
Kelsey brought together her experience of singing in the corset and the evolving 
control relationship it established, coming to 3 states reflective of this experience, 
drawing further inspiration from concepts identified as central ideas in Whitman’s 
Leaves of Grass, namely the corruption of the mind-body-soul.

These became microstructures within the larger composition (see Figure 5), and the 
sonic and aesthetic aims of these episodes are outlined below. 
5.4 The Body Electric performance
5.4.1 Connection (and catching breath)
In the first section of the composition (see Figure 5, green), a processing module in 
MaxMSP that utilised the pillow data to manipulate the playback rate and volume of 
pre-recorded vocal material was designed. Each pre-recorded line is progressively 
introduced, and the playback rate and volume is manipulated as Kelsey takes in more 
air. With each addition of text, the pillows are given more “control” over the rate at 
which the sonic material is manipulated and distorted, and its volume, when she

breathes. The sounds of Kelsey’s live breathing—controlling the manipulation of the 
tape material—is further amplified within the soundscape. They (the artefact and 
Kelsey) navigate between a control and co-performance relationship in this section, as 
she connects more with the artefact (by breathing deeper and crushing the pillows), 
giving more agency in its manipulation of sound by allowing it more ‘access’ to her 
breathing. As Kelsey breathes deeper, her movements have greater sonic 
consequences on the soundscape, and further impact upon her ability to sing with the 
artefact in later sections, because the corset accelerates her physical fatigue. During 
this section, Kelsey manipulated her breathing depth and slowly moved her breath 
around her body to each pillow,  allowing the sonic material to be progressively 
mutated through her increasing connection to the interface.
5.4.2 Disconnection (and dissecting bodies)
In this second section(see Figure 5, pink) Kelsey wanted to separate her breathing 
from her singing, by exploring the concept of "voiceless singing". The muscles 
controlling her breathing construct her voice, using the physiological changes in her 
body that occur normally when she sings, but without her actually making sound. In 
this portion of the composition Kelsey used her body as a sort of bellows, breathing in 
different directions, speeds and depths to create a body-motion activated choir with 
her muscles, using the psychoirtrist~ harmoniser1 in MaxMSP. She sought to 
disconnect herself from her breathing in order to use her sensed breathing zones (see 
Figure 1) as independent musical voices. Each pillow, shaped by and interacting with 
her changing body, began to “sing” with each other, breaking off into duets and trios, 
as Kelsey spatialised her breath across each pillow zone (see Figure 1, Panel B). Her 
body and breath inhabited the role of a co-performer with these pillows, through 
deliberate disconnection of her breath within her body and de-synchronised breathing 
actions. To further establish the independence of each muscle - each sensor - was 
mapped in a one-to-many configuration, with each pillow assigned to its own specific 
“voice” within the psychoirtrist~ harmoniser. This specific harmonizer was uniquely 
suited to this, as the base patch is configured for 4 control components within each 
signal transformation. The mapping of each pillow to their own designated control 
component at each level of the signal transformation, emphasised the de-
synchronisation and disconnection between her body and breath, and the 4 pillow 
“voices”.

5.4.3 Questioning and scrambling bodily boundaries 
In this final episode of the work (see Figure 5, blue), biosignal data from the sensors is 
used to control a granular synthesis engine in MaxMSP which processes the voice in 
real-time. The functions of the engine, such as grain size, positioning and speed are 
directly controlled by the pressure values of the 4 sensor pillows. Kelsey used the 
physical fatigue and disconnection between body and breath that she typically 
experiences during this sequence to determine the ordering, length and speed of the 
grains of her voice. The comprehensibility of the text in this episode is determined by 
the extent to which her fatigued and failing muscles can interact with the corset, 
pushing the pillows back. Each pillow takes a role in controlling various components of 
the granular engine, using data streams from pillows placed higher on her body as her 
breath moves higher as her body begins to "break down".
6. Discussion
Through the experience in the design, construction and experimentation of her corset 
interface in the composition and performance of her work The Body Electric (video via 
this link) it became apparent that the re-framing of the body as the musical interface 
facilitated a departure from the typical experience of working with a NIME. Previous 
work in NIME design has approached the construction of interfaces that harness 
bodily information such as biosignals or gestural data, working on building a control 
system  situated within an understanding of the body in space and the creative 
potential of harnessing electrical signals naturally occurring within the performer’s 
body, or the body’s gestural movements. By turning away from this approach, and 
drawing from principles of soma design, K’s utilisation and engagement with her own 
soma (and the changes to and in it) made the corset not just an interactive interface, 
but a sort of co-performer which facilitates curious engagements between body, 
technology and somatic experience. 
6.1 Interacting t h r o u g h  and w i t h  the Body Electric interface
The interactivity offered by this corset also impacted upon Kelsey’s relationship with 
and through her instrument, causing her to disrupt and adjust her normal vocal 
practice, specifically her breathing, yielding a range of breathing variations to shape 
the soundscape. We consider this an example of the novel interactions that emerged 
through working with the interface. This influenced the approach to composing, where 
she used the progression of her interaction with the artefact (Connection - 
Disconnection - Questioning) as musical sequences. These were linked to Whitman’s 
notion of corruption, in the changing connection Kelsey experienced with her

instrument as a result of the engaging with the interface: connectionand catching 
breath (section 5.5.1) - disconnectionand dissected bodies (section 5.5.2) - questioning 
and scrambling bodily boundaries (section 5.5.3).  
6.2 Control and curious entanglements
Kelsey’s interaction with the artefact, and her “control” of the sound-world being 
transferred to the corset interface throughout performance, was used as a meta-
structure for the composition, as was the accelerated  ‘making and unmaking’ of her 
instrument. The corset provided a lens through which Kelsey’s voice is diffracted by 
the relationship between her and it, and the dissolving of the boundaries between 
them. This ‘controller to co-performer’ dynamic, recalls Naccarato’s and MacCallum’s 
proposition on subject and object becoming entangled [44]. Kelsey’s body and her 
physiological processes become entangled with, and shaped by, the corset.
Through building a NIME which places the bodily experience of a physiological 
process as central, it was discovered that an interface designed for the body using 
soma design principles can open up creative opportunities in examining the nature of 
the relationship between performer and interface, how both influence each other and 
the potential this invites for dissolving of the notion of performer-as-controller of 
object. This presents creative opportunities in re-considering musical interfaces as co-
performers in an artistic work, and usage of the experience of wearing and interacting 
with somaesthetic NIMEs in the development of creative musical works. Our approach 
to using soma design for developing this NIME, as a design method that puts a strong 
focus on becoming attentive to and reflecting on first person somatic experiences, 
shows a great potential for how soma design can enrich the NIME community. Our 
work contributes with a rich example of a NIME, accompanied by the detailed process 
behind its design, development and deployment as a musical performance piece. This 
NIME is grounded in the performer’s experience of, and relationship to their bodily 
changes in performance. Thus, our work extends the work by Martinez-Avila et al [36], 
offering a concrete example of using soma design for NIMEs, accompanied by 
reflections on the expanded experience of the Kelsey’s work with her interface.
7. Conclusion 
This paper presents a novel interface for the capture and use of biofeedback signals 
generated by breathing and subsequent physiological changes caused during singing. 
It presents a novel approach to  NIME design which is grounded in the performer’s 
subjective experience of their body in performance. The creation of this NIME draws

from principles of soma design, resulting in an ultra-personalised interface that utilises 
sensors capable of capturing the subjective physiological changes experienced in the 
body of the performer. The somatic NIME corset enabled novel interactions and an 
unexpected "making and unmaking" of the first author’s instrument. The harnessing of 
the biosignal information was further used as a compositional tool in a performative 
and artistic setting, facilitating the performer’s interaction with their body through 
their body. The findings from this work illustrate the creative potential of designing 
somatic NIMEs that utilise the bodily experience of a musician, and their experiential 
relationship and connection to their instrument.
