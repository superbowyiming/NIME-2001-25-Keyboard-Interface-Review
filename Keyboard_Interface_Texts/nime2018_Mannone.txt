ABSTRACT
We developed a new musical interface, CubeHarmonic, with
the magnetic 3D motion tracking system IM3D. This sys-
tem precisely tracks positions of tiny, wireless, battery-less,
and identiﬁable markers (LC coils) in real time. The Cube-
Harmonic is a musical application of the Rubik’s cube, with
notes on each little piece. Scrambling the cube, we get dif-
ferent chords and chord sequences. Positions of the pieces
which contain LC coils are detected through IM3D, and
transmitted to the computer to recognize the status of the
Rubik’s cube, that plays sounds. The central position of
the cube is also measured by the LC coils located into the
corners of Rubik’s cube, and, depending on the position,
we can manipulate overall loudness and pitch changes, as
in theremin playing. This new instrument, whose ﬁrst idea
comes from mathematical theory of music, can be used as
a teaching tool both for math (group theory) and music
(music theory, mathematical music theory), as well as a
composition device, a new instrument for avant-garde per-
formances, and a recreational tool.

1. INTRODUCTION
Music and combinatorics have a long tradition of intersec-
tions, research, and music composition [2, 5]. We can think
of musical dice game (Musikalische W ¨urfelspiele), used to
compose from random combinations of pre-composed mu-

sical material, with examples by Llull, Haydn, and Mozart
[13, 10]. Combinatorics deals with group theory. A combi-
nation of two elements of a group gives an element of the
same group. Groups verify closure, associativity, identity,
and invertibility properties [11]. In a permutation group,
the permutations of a given set (elements) can be com-
posed (operation) giving other permutations of the same set.
Figure 1: The Cube-
Harmonic
First developed as a peda-
gogical tool by Ern ¨o Rubik,
the homonymous cube is a
toy based on group permu-
tations in three dimensions.
In our work 1 (Figure 1), we
start from a musical Rubik’s
cube, the CubeHarmonic, to
propose a new musical instru-
ment, using a magnetic 3D
motion tracking system de-
veloped at the Tohoku Uni-
versity [4, 3]. The Cube-
Harmonic was ﬁrst thought
by Maria Mannone in 2013
and then described in a text-
book about mathematical mu-
sic theory [7]. A cube-like de-
vice for musical chords con-
nects the concept oftonnetz (a
2- or 3-dimensional scheme with points as notes or chords,
and paths as connections between them) with the permu-
tations [6], see Section 3.1. Other musical applications of
the Rubik’s cube were independently proposed in a NIME
article [9] and in a TED tutorial 2 [12]. In [12], only a the-
oretical idea is discussed. In [9], a new device is proposed,
where “the precise combination itself is not so composition-
ally important,” “not directly under the performer’s con-
trol.” However, in our case, the precise combinations are
compositionally relevant, as well as the performer’s control.
Moreover, instead of a simple controller, we are considering
both precise theoretical reasons, as well as many other mu-
sical features (overall loudness and pitch change) creating
crossmodal eﬀects.

2. MAGNETIC 3D MOTION TRACKING
The system generates a magnetic ﬁeld to tiny and wireless
LC coils. It detects the resonant magnetic ﬂux from the
LC coils to compute their 3D location and orientation, see
Figure 2 [4, 3]. If the LC coils are attached to a Rubik’s
cube, we can track in real-time the facets’ movements. We
can visualize the cube in a virtual environment and convert
the facet combination into sounds.

3. MUSICAL PERSPECTIVES
3.1 A tool for music theorists
In [7], a 4x4x4 cube is used for a 4-part harmony. The cur-
rent prototype is a 3x3x3 cube. With a 3-part harmony, the
performer can still enjoy a considerable amount of combina-
tions, with the advantages of easiness in cube’s scrambling,
and only a few markers (LC coils) for motion tracking. The
CubeHarmonic allows a tangible application ofslot-machine
transformations.3
3.2 A tool for composers and improvisers
Figure 3 shows a perspective from above of the cube and
the magnets. The user can scramble the cube (blue arrow),
getting new chords and chord sequences. The overall dis-
placement of the cube (red arrow) changes the overall loud-
ness and pitch; e.g., we can play a diminuendo to silence,
or a crescendo with glissando. We can play quarter-tones,
and adapt to other instruments’ tuning. The pitch-change
option can be enabled or disabled. The notes can be cus-
tomized, determining the degree of harmonic variability. In
a performance setup, the combinations given by the cube
may constitute an harmonic basis for the other instruments.
There is no ﬁxed-tempo sequencer. In our video, we show
cube playing featured in a composed cube-piano duo (Man-
none’s Hello Cube!) and in a free improvised trio (with
percussion).
Figure 3: Movements and their musical output
3In Music Theory, the slot-machine metaphor refers to a
permutation, more than a rotation. Let us imagine to have
three discs with three notes each one. The notes of a disc
played after the other give a sequence of three 3-note chords.
If we rotate one of the discs, the vertical sequence 0 −1 −2
will become 1 −2 −0: the harmonic content is the same,
while the melodic content is not [1].
4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The advantages of our device are the easiness to use, the
possibility to customize the harmonic material, and the eas-
iness to ‘reset.’ In fact, to go back to the initial “unscram-
bled” conﬁguration, we do not need to solve the cube: even
if the physical cube is still unsolved, the program can be
restarted to an initial unscrambled conﬁguration. The ad-
vantage over instruments such as theremin is that we can
have chords, and an easier interface to play. Vibrato might
be made possible. Next applications will include collabo-
rative and more complex music with theremin and haptic
devices [8] and the improvement of the mobile app to sim-
ulate our instrument without IM3D. Tracking speed and
precision, as well as timbral variety, will be improved in
future prototypes. A more user-friendly interface is under
development, to enable the performer in changing the initial
note-material without any coding. A new visual cue with
multiple views would allow the performer to more easily
predict the upcoming combinations. We will also include
a MIDI output, enhancing the cube’s compatibility with
synthesizers and other electronic instruments. We can in-
vestigate the cube in classroom scenarios, to make tangible
and enjoyable some abstract concepts.
