Abstract
This paper describes the design and creation of an electronically
augmented replica of a historical harpsichord keyboard with a
typical 17th-century Italian layout to create a digital musical
instrument. The keyboard was commissioned for exhibition in a
musical instrument museum to enhance the visitor experience
by providing an interface to digitised versions of instruments
within the collection. The replica balances the competing de-
mands of historical authenticity, public accessibility, and preser-
vation. It replicates the original instrument’s tactile feedback and
mechanical resistance using historically informed construction
techniques. Optical sensors integrated within the mechanism
capture the jacks’ motion data, enabling MIDI message gener-
ation. This work situates itself within broader discussions on
the role of technology in museums. A keyboard interface of this

1 Introduction
Technological advances have transformed how museums docu-
ment, present and interpret their collections. Immersive experi-
ences are realised through tools such as 3D printing and virtual
reality [1, 13, 19, 22, 29]. These technologies form a kind of expe-
riential authenticity, enabling encounters that evoke the past’s
sensory, emotional, and intellectual essence [25]. However, as
Pine and Gilmore note [21], achieving authenticity requires mu-
seums to navigate the delicate balance between preservation and
meaningful engagement—a challenge that is particularly evident
in the case of historical musical instrument collections [15].
Musical instruments represent a peculiar fusion of form, func-
tion, and history. Their cultural value extends beyond their visual
appeal to include the tactile and auditory dimensions of use [8].
Yet, preservation concerns often limit direct interaction, reducing
these artefacts to static displays. This “red velvet cord” approach,
as theorised by McAlpine [15], protects fragile mechanisms but
diminishes the instruments’ functional identity, disconnecting
visitors from the full richness of their historical and cultural
context.
The Tagliavini Collection in Bologna [27], housed at Museo
San Colombano - Genus Bononiae and renowned for its historical
keyboard instruments, exempli￿es this dilemma. With over ￿fty
early keyboard instruments, primarily early plucked stringed
keyboards of Italian origin, the collection stands out as a valuable
resource for musicologists, organologists and musicians alike.
Preserving the instruments’ authenticity was the cornerstone of
Ferdinando Tagliavini’s vision. This guiding principle led him
to collect instruments that could be restored to their playing
condition after minimal intervention.
However, the delicate mechanisms of these instruments and
their historical signi￿cance mean they are only played under
strict conditions—by experienced historical keyboard performers
or young musicians under strict supervision from the curator.
To enhance accessibility and engagement, the museum commis-
sioned the replica (Figure 1) of a historical keyboard built in the
tradition of the Italian school, which is the subject of this pa-
per. The keyboard targets all visitors to the museum, regardless
of playing ability, and can be used without special permission.
Jacks that pluck two choirs of muted strings, across 49-keys, are
used to generate MIDI messages that are sent to a connected
computer for audio synthesis. The interface is presently linked
to a commercial software sampler; however, the ultimate aim is
to make the sound of instruments in the collection that can no
longer be maintained in playable condition accessible. Museum
visitors are invited to play the interface and listen through a
pair of headphones. This work outlines the technological aspects
of the interface’s construction and o￿ers re￿ections on its role
within the Tagliavini Collection and potential application within
the wider musical instrument museum context.
2 Related Work and Motivations
Museums face a constant tension between accessibility and preser-
vation, restricting how visitors can interact with collections
[15, 23]. For musical instrument museums, these challenges are
compounded by the di￿culty of preserving historical instruments
in a playable condition [15]. The instruments’ inherent fragility
and gradual decay inevitably result in a point where they can no
longer be played, even when collections adhere to the strictest
conservation protocols [20]. A marked cultural change has taken
place in recent decades, shifting the focus from the playability of
the originals to their conservation. Karp [11, 12] advocates for
a deeper understanding of musical instruments so that enough
knowledge is generated to make them as “copyable” as possible.
As part of a broader initiative to enhance accessibility in mu-
seums, the Museo San Colombano - Tagliavini Collection, within
the cultural itinerary of Fondazione Carisbo, has developed a se-
ries of projects aimed at improving cognitive and sensory access,
supported by funding from NextGenerationEU. The project seeks
to leverage the museum’s collection of musical instruments to
create an immersive and interactive engagement with the ex-
hibited heritage. The reinterpretation of historical musical ob-
jects through their tactile and auditory dimensions is intended to
make the exhibition more accessible to blind and partially sighted
visitors. The augmented keyboard aligns with these objectives,
serving as an important component of the initiative to provide
visitors of varying abilities with a hands-on, creative experience
within the museum.
McAlpine discusses a case similar to the Tagliavini collection
in his examination of the Benton Fletcher Collection at National
Trust Fenton House [15]. When these instruments were donated,
Benton Fletcher stipulated that they remain playable and should
continue to be maintained for tuition and public performance. A
large sampling campaign was conducted, and a custom MIDI in-
terface was designed to ful￿l this requirement while preserving
the original instruments’ integrity. The MIDI controller, com-
prising two commercially available keyboards mimicking the
two-manual harpsichord layout, was used by visitors to trigger
the instrument samples recorded with tailored strategies for each.
However, user tests identi￿ed a limitation: the commercially
available weighted keys failed to provide an authentic sense of
interacting with a historical plucked keyboard instrument [15].
On the other hand, the “Tromba Moderna” project [2], a pre-
vious NIME initiative, approached the issue of musical heritage
playability by recreating and augmenting a replica of a historical
tromba marina. A piezo transducer was connected to a sound
synthesis engine and a driver within the instrument to simulate
the expected vibrations of a historical tromba marina.
The keyboard presented here inherits some aspects from the
Tromba Moderna project. The project aims to o￿er a tool to
enhance the visitor experience of the Tagliavini collection while
retaining a form of continuity with historical instrument-building
traditions. However, the electronics hidden inside the interface
are not intended to augment or disrupt the tactile feedback; rather,
they serve as the silent and invisible link between the mechanical
and the digital realms.
The optical sensing technique for the keyboard is adapted
from a similar project on the piano by McPherson [16]. As such,
this project extends the longevity of the results beyond the scope
envisaged in the original works, enhancing their sustainability,
as discussed by Masuet al.[14]. The intended use of the keyboard
through meaningful interaction with a museum exhibit is where
the novelty of this work lies, rather than solely in its technological
development.
Besides enhancing the visitor experience, future design iter-
ations will serve as a research tool to explore the unique char-
acteristics of the harpsichord and its impact on performance
through the ERC-funded NEMUS project [5], aiming to virtu-
ally reproduce the sound of antique keyboard instruments, and
upcoming projects such as Rem@ke [4] investigating embodied
relationships between instrument and performer.

3 Design Principles
The design of the augmented replica keyboard for the Museo
San Colombano - Genus Bononiae was guided by three principal
constraints stipulated by the museum:
• Faithfulness. The keyboard mechanism had to ensure ￿-
delity to its authentic operation. The electronics system
would not seek to ‘￿x’ or ‘improve’ the limitations of the
original design.
• Robustness and reliability. The system needed to accom-
modate frequent use by museum visitors and allow for
straightforward maintenance by sta￿ without requiring
specialised technical expertise.
• No visible electronic components. To preserve the visual
integrity of the exhibit, all electronic components had to
remain concealed except for a pair of headphones and a
small display for audio parameter adjustments.
• Reduced use of space. As museums often face space limita-
tions, the instrument needed be compact enough not to
compromise space for exhibition of the permanent display.
These constraints demanded an electronics system that was
non-invasive in design and respectful of the instruments’ histori-
cal aesthetics. The requirement for faithfulness to the original
mechanism immediately ruled out a mechanical design reliant
on electromechanical actuators, as in previous works on piano
haptics [9, 24]. While actuators can generate considerable force,
achieving a jack’s free motion and resistance is di￿cult without
extensive mechanical intervention such as that carried out by
Gillespie [9].
The ￿nal design, shown in Figures 1 and 2, is a 49-key, two-
register harpsichord keyboard replica. Since the Tagliavini collec-
tion hosts primarily early plucked stringed keyboards of Italian
origin, the keyboard layout was deliberately modelled after early
Italian harpsichords, leveraging the human tendency to be in-
￿uenced by visual elements when making musical judgments
[26]. This e￿ect is particularly relevant in musical instruments, as
demonstrated by studies conducted by Fritzet al.[6–8]. Instead
of attempting to mitigate this in￿uence, the design embraces it.
This phenomenon, akin to a ‘musical instrument McGurk e￿ect’,
is one of the reasons why the electronics have been concealed
from view. The aesthetics of the interface enhance its likelihood
of being perceived as an ‘authentic’ musical instrument. Given
the extensive research into modelling and recreating piano action
[3, 9, 24], the visual component may provide the ￿nal persua-
sive element necessary for acceptance, similar to the way visual
perception a￿ects judgments of musical performance [26].
Optical sensors are positioned in front of each jack and their
output voltage depends on the amount of light re￿ected from
a sensor surface. In this case, the sensor surface is a grey-scale
gradient printed on a vinyl sticker (Figure 3) and applied to the
side of each jack. Though the current con￿guration simply sends
MIDI note-on and -o￿ messages when passing a threshold, the
displacement of all jacks is available continuously. The jacks
for a single key typically have their pluck points o￿set from
each other, a practice known as ‘staggering’. A combination of
Figure 3: Gradient stickers applied to the side of the jack
body. The coarse gradient scale was selected to maximise
signal excursion while preserving signal readout stability.

ber (bottom).
string tension, quill voicing, and jack staggering contribute to
the overall resistance of the action, with each key di￿ering from
the low to the high octaves [28]. The staggering of the pluck
point of the jacks between registers means that there are two
distinct tactile anchors along the key dip. The current sensor
system enables the data recording of traditional use from which
it can be identi￿ed where those opportunities for new expression
lie [17].
A modular system of printed circuit boards (PCBs) was de-
signed to manage the sensors and process their output. The sys-
tem uses 49 optical sensors distributed across seven boards con-
taining 7 sensors each. The PCBs were secured to the underside
of the wrest plank and above the keys (Figure 4), allowing them
to be adjusted during installation. Ribbon cables connected the
PCBs, providing ￿exibility during assembly while maintaining a
compact form factor. Additional modi￿cations, including ba￿es
and adhesive improvements, were made to optimise the reliability
of the sensor system during calibration and use.
The project expanded upon earlier NIME research on gener-
ating MIDI messages from piano keystrokes [16], adapting it to
address the speci￿c characteristics of harpsichords. Whereas the
previous design emphasised continuous gesture tracking, this im-
plementation required discrete key-triggered data to align with
the needs of MIDI-triggered audio playback.
3.1 Materials and Construction
The keyboard was designed to replicate the tactile and aesthetic
sensations of playing a historical Italian harpsichord. Traditional
materials were used, including walnut for the wrest plank, chest-
nut for the key levers, boxwood and ebony for key covers, and
cypress for the case and soundboard. The 98 jacks were made
from beech, ￿tted with brass springs and natural seagull feather
plectra. The design was inspired by the 1547 Alessandro Tra-
suntino harpsichord at the San Colombano Museum, considered
one of the ￿rst prototypes to have been conceived with two sets
of 8-foot strings. An exception was made for the short octave —
the assigning of common keys in the ￿rst octave instead of a chro-
matic scale — typically found in Italian harpsichords, which was
replaced by a standard octave layout to more easily accommodate
the interaction with commercial sample libraries.
The rectangular poplar frame also deviates from the traditional
logarithmic (Figure 5) form to allow for the installation of the
electronic sensors, as visible in Figure 4, without compromising
the visual or tactile authenticity. Two string choirs, crafted from
yellow brass wire and anchored with wrought iron pins, were
tensioned to replicate authentic plucking resistance. Felt strips
were added to dampen vibrations. The result is an interface that
combines the mechanical action of keys with synthetic sound
generation, preserving a real harpsichord’s tactile qualities.
3.2 Project Deployment
A further objective, set forth by the authors, was to ensure re-
producibility by committing to an open source approach for all
outputs of the project. The commitment to open sourcing encom-
passed all aspects of the system, including hardware schemat-
ics, ￿rmware, and calibration data. Cost-e￿ectiveness was also
a central consideration. Speci￿cally, the system was designed
to be easily assembled using resources typically available in a
university-managed maker space. Components, such as QRE1113
optical sensors and CD4051BE multiplexers, are widely available
from commercial resellers, while the modular PCB design en-
sures easy replication and maintenance. The Arduino Nano was
chosen as the core microcontroller format for its compatibility
with open source tools. Calibration work￿ows were optimised
using the Arduino IDE’s serial plotter and open source MIDI

4 Hardware Design
Figure 8 shows a block diagram of the ￿nalised hardware setup.
The system evolved through iterative prototyping, beginning
with simple threshold-based testing and ending in a fully func-
tional multi-sensor interface capable of triggering MIDI events.
4.1 Prototype Stage
The initial stage of development focused on testing whether
sensor data could reliably trigger MIDI playback. Modifying an
existing harpsichord for testing was considered but ultimately
discarded due to signi￿cant internal measurement and layout
discrepancies. Instead, a custom 3-key harpsichord mechanism
(Figure 6) was used as a foundation for prototyping. This ap-
proach followed a methodology similar to that used in Timmer-
mans et al.’s Haptic Key project [24], since the 3-key model en-
abled iterative testing of individual components, including sensor
placement, signal processing, and mechanical tolerances, before
upscaling.
The following criteria were established to guide sensor selec-
tion and integration to make the system suitable for a museum
context:
• Non-invasiveness: No remarkable modi￿cations were al-
lowed on the harpsichord mechanics, particularly on all
the visible parts.
• Low Latency:The sampling period for reading and process-
ing data from all sensors should remain under 10 ms to
allow for latency introduced in other parts of the synthesis
process. Empirical criteria found in previous studies [10]
was used as a guide.
• Reliability: Sensor data should be dependable and consis-
tent, with interference from anything external to the jack
movement being absent or negligible.
• Scalability: The design needed to scale in both cost and
time in order to be adaptable from a 3-key prototype (Fig-
ure 6) up to the 49 keys of the ￿nal design.
The hardware was designed to make assembly possible in
standard university maker spaces.

4.2 Sensor Board
The ￿nal sensor system utilised QRE1113 optical sensors, known
for their small form factor, low cost, and suitability for short-
range distance detection [16, 18]. The sensors were distributed
across seven printed circuit boards, each responsible for seven
keys. Each PCB contained the following components:
• 7 QRE1113 optical sensors.
• 7 100⌦ resistors and 7 10 k⌦ resistors (later reduced to
one resistor per board).
• 1 Texas Instruments CD4051BE multiplexer for signal ag-
gregation.
• 7 WS2812 RGB LEDs with integrated driver.
The optical sensors are wired in a voltage divider con￿guration
(Figure 7) and the circuit outputs a voltage based on the infrared
light re￿ected from nearby surfaces. The gradient stickers a￿xed
to each jack provided a surface with varying re￿ectivity for the
sensors, which were used to track jack displacement throughout
the key dip.
3D-printed ba￿es were installed on the PCBs to eliminate
cross-talk between adjacent sensors, as per Figure 9. These baf-
￿es, fabricated from dark-pigmented PLA, ensured that infrared
re￿ections from neighbouring jacks did not interfere with sensor
readings. A manual visual check of plotted all sensors readings
con￿rmed that interference from neighbouring jacks had been
eliminated. RGB LEDs are placed on the reverse side of the PCB,
vertically in-line with the sensors, and were added to provide a
programmable means of providing visual feedback. The LEDs
are controlled via a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal and
are addressable individually. The output signal of the multiplexer
is taken from each PCB and routed to a separate ADC channel of
the Arduino. Multiplexer channel select and LED PWM signals
are daisy-chained through each PCB (Figure 10).
4.3 Controller Board
The controller board, designed around the Arduino Nano format,
was the central hub for processing sensor data and triggering
MIDI messages. In addition to solder terminals for the sensor
board channels, the controller board contained:
• 1 Arduino Nano 33 BLE.
• 1 Fujitsu MB85RS64 SPI Ferroelectric RAM chip.
• 1 EC11 combined rotary encoder and tactile switch.
The Arduino Nano’s small form factor made ￿tting the board
inside the harpsichord easier and also allowed for testing of
multiple chipsets. The 33 BLE variation of the Nano had the
additional bene￿t in its ability to be programmed as both native

USB MIDI and BLE MIDI devices. The 33 BLE was also able to
achieve a sampling period of 1.7 milliseconds for all sensors. A
4-sample moving average ￿lter was implemented to reduce noise
and brought the e￿ective sampling period to 5.1 milliseconds.
Non-volatile memory, implemented using a Fujitsu MB85RS64
Ferroelectric RAM (FRAM) chip, provided a reliable means of
storing and preserving calibration settings across power cycles.
This ensured that sensor thresholds and other settings could be
preserved across power cycles, enhancing the system’s usability
in museums.
A rotary encoder was used as the interface to select a key, edit
a threshold and save current thresholds to the FRAM. Thresh-
olds were ￿rst set the midrange of possible values a a default.
A rough calibration process was carried out where each sensor
were selected individually and its readings were plotted against
their current threshold value using the Arduino IDE serial plotter.
Thresholds were adjusted with the rotary encoder until the key
no longer passed the threshold line until the jack had plucked
the string. During calibration RGB LEDs were used as a visual
aid to quickly identify which key was currently being adjusted.
These LEDs also provided visual feedback during calibration, and
would change colour based on if readings were above below the
threshold or if the were outside previously recorded maximum
or minimum values. Such use of the LEDs meant for easy identi-
￿cation of malfunctioning sensors and simpli￿ed the alignment
process. A ￿ner calibration process was carried out with the
guidance of expert harpsichord performer Catalina Vicens.
Power requirements for the system were estimated at 1.1 A at
5 V, with some ￿uctuation when the system was ￿rst powered
on. While the sensors were powered continuously in this iter-
ation, future designs may incorporate power-saving measures,
such as dynamic modulation of the optical emitters found in the
McPherson piano [16].
For the initial version of the exhibition, a harpsichord sample
library was used and controlled via Native Instrument’s Kon-
takt2. The software was installed on a Mac Mini hosted inside
the instrument’s case. Holes were drilled at the back of the in-
strument’s frame, away from sight, to allow the passage of cables,
such as from power supplies, USB connectors and headphone
jack (Figure 11). An iPad is used as a monitor through which
visitors can adjust playback parameters such as tuning, voicing
and which stops are engaged.

5 Discussion
The exhibition is set to open approximately a month after this
work’s submission, and only preliminary feedback has been col-
lected from a pool of 20 people – consisting of sta￿, surveillance
personnel and visitors who were given training on the system –
and expert feedback from Catalina Vicens and Roberto Livi. Visi-
tor feedback was collected through short informal interviews and
primarily to identify technical problems. The keyboard shows
promise in enhancing the museum experience as comments about
a “sense of disconnect” found in the Benton Fletcher Collection
[15] were absent in this initial feedback.
A more formal surveying of museum visitors would be re-
quired to determine to what degree the exhibition achieved its
core aims. The keyboard is hosted in theOratory above the mu-
seum’s main hall, an exceptional testimony to the Bolognese art,
decorated by the ￿nest students of the Carracci and presenting
a series of frescoes covering most of the walls and ceiling. The
room hosts unique examples of the Italian Renaissance building
tradition, including the 1547 harpsichord and the 1540 spinet
by Alessandro Trasuntino. Visitors often visit the room with
the same caution and respect typical of worship spaces. Among
the visitors interviewed, no comments were made that the ex-
posed headphones and touchscreen a￿ected such an experience
negatively, though a more de￿nitive answer will come as more
feedback is collected after launch. Pictures of the keyboard hosted
in theOratory are shown in Figure 12.
Expert feedback has highlighted limitations, including impre-
cise key calibration, which creates a temporal disconnect between
the tactile plucking sensation and sound onset. Additionally, the
commercial sample library, while allowing the selection of regis-
ters such as 8’, 4’, and their combinations, restricts functionality
to a single MIDI message per key, regardless of the number of
string choirs controlled. Inspired by early Italian instruments, the
keyboard’s layout is designed to manage two 8’ registers with a
sensor system ￿tted to each. Internally, the instrument functions
as two separate MIDI devices. However, one register must be
disengaged due to the software’s limited communication with
Figure 12: The keyboard installed in theOratory at San
Colombano, and a user wearing headphones playing it.
only a single device. While running multiple instances of the soft-
ware is possible, having two sets of GUI controls was considered
too confusing for visitors engaging with the exhibition without
prior orientation. Consequently, sensors are only active on single
jacks to accommodate these constraints. Future iterations could
address these limitations through technical improvements, such
as re￿ned calibration with hysteresis and developing a custom
sample library and interface.
This work has incorporated and developed further the ideas
of reusing and complimenting the ‘old’ in digital musical instru-
ment design as put forward in the article ‘TheO in NIME’ [14].
By integrating historical keyboard-building traditions with dig-
ital augmentation, it o￿ers a possibility to extend the practical
lifespan of musical heritage while maintaining the tactile quali-
ties of the original instrument. Rather than prioritising technical
novelty, the project demonstrates how digital interventions can
support multi-modal interaction with a shared musical heritage,
ensuring its continued relevance in contemporary museum con-
texts.
A longer discussion, but one going beyond the scope of this
work, is whether the current setup or its future iterations may be
e￿ectively used to build legitimate replicas of historical musical
instruments or even become a kind ofnew musical instrument
altogether. As such, the question is whether these designs may
result in music being practised, performed and recorded with
the instruments. This work supports an overarching narrative
extending beyond its application in museum collections. The
NEMUS project [5], focusing on developing advanced physical
models simulating the non-linear interaction between subcom-
ponents, has commissioned a second keyboard to further explore
the role of control interfaces in performance, employing the sense
of touch as link between the mechanical world with the digital,
replicating the embodied relationships between performer and
instrument and o￿ering opportunities to modify or even disrupt
these interactions. The upcoming Rem@ke project [4] has also
expressed an interest in engaging with the keyboard to explore
meaningful embodied interactions between players and instru-
ments.
