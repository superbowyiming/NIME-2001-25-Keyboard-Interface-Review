Abstract
The Memory Cloud is a musical instrument that uses a player’s
own library of personal recordings as sonic material. This pa-
per presents the design of the instrument, situating it within
sustainability HCI studies and constraints-based design, before
describing the instrument being used by two musicians in a pro-
fessional context. Over 2000 sounds from the musician’s personal
cloud library, dating back over 10 years, were placed in the instru-
ment as the only sonic material available for exploring. I argue
that a radically small scale and personal approach could be one
strategy for addressing the issues of longevity in NIME, and I
suggest that using personal media libraries presents a potential
affordance and constraint for musical instrument design.

My cloud library is full. 34,638 photogaphs and 1,308 videos are
taking up my 2TB allocation. As a designer working with sound
it is not difficult to see the videos in particular as a form of sonic

content - it is raw, recorded mainly on my phone and full of wind
noise, clipping, muffled by a poorly positioned hands. And yet
it is unmistakeably mine. No one else even has access to this li-
brary, built up almost accidentally over many years, representing
virtually all of the major events in my life. Chances are, you have
one of these libraries too (though you may manage yours better
than mine). What would it mean to use these sounds? What kind
of musical relationship can we build through encounters with
this media?
This paper presents an instrument that takes a user’s entire
cloud library and repurposes it for musical use: The Memory
Cloud. Pressing a button calls up a memory from the past and
allows the player to break it apart or reconfigure it in any num-
ber of ways. In doing so the player builds a relationship with
their own sonic history, unfolding new affordances for musical
expression.
2 Background
2.1 Cornucopian design
Our overly saturated cloud media libraries, and indeed the entire
existence of cloud storage, can be situated within what has been
called the cornucopian paradigm of computing [16]. This is an
approach to designing computer technologies with a fundamental
assumption that all options and data should be made instantly
available to the user at all times. Cloud libraries provide the
potential for users to store all of their media, and the priority from
a design standpoint is for the user to be able to seamlessly access

it anytime and anywhere. This is clearly unsustainable from a
number of perspectives [9], with a growing body of sustainable
HCI (SHCI) research calling for post-growth [20], degrowth [3],
computing within limits [2, 15, 22] and deeper inner transitions
[4] when considering the design of computing technologies.
2.2 Affordances and constraints
The work described here engages both with constraints-based
design from a sustainability standpoint as well as in terms of the
creative opportunities it presents. As discussed by Magnusson
[11], among others, constraints and affordances are "two sides of
the same coin", at least for musical instruments (pg 71). Design
constraints, such as the number of strings on a guitar or the
number of polyphonic voices on a synthesizer, are things that a
musician discovers and engages with through exploration and
play, potentially creating a relationship. That embodied, situated,
and evolving dynamic can be seen as the affordances of an instru-
ment. As Holzer argues through Barad’s notion of agential cuts
[8], the affordances of an instrument are thus comprised of the
specific set of possibilities that are built between an instrument
and player.
2.3 Longevity and NIME
The instrument described in this paper is by definition very per-
sonal, and thus it is unlikely to be developed in any large-scale
way. There will be no "future developments" section in this paper
where I suggest that a commercial version could be released;
indeed, the paper will argue rather that the radically small-scale
nature of this work is precisely what generates the musical af-
fordances in the instrument. Nevertheless there are aspects of
this work that link it to some of the recent discussions around
longevity in NIME [5, 12]. In particular this work engages with
concepts of ownership, which has been suggested as a poten-
tial mechanism for encouraging long term use of an instrument
[14, 23]. Additionally, by foregrounding the conceptual position-
ing of the instrument within sustainable HCI we align with recent
calls for more "outward-looking" work [13] to encourage wider
discussions of the socio-political ramifications of designing mu-
sical technologies.
2.4 Personal sonic content
The specific constraint that is being using in the Memory Cloud
is the sound library. Once the instrument has been set up for
the player, there is no way of adding new sounds or recording
samples into the machine1. Instead, the only sounds available to
be loaded into the granular engine come from the player’s own
cloud library. Admittedly this can be quite large (and in that sense
pushes the boundaries of the term "constraint"), but nevertheless
virtually guarantees that the sonic output will be associated with
historical and emotional connection to the sonic source. Using
what are essentially field recordings as musical content creates
obvious parallels with the musique concrète practices of Schae-
fer [18] and Pade [1], among many others. Through the use of
personal sounds in particular, the work described here aligns
strongly with Matthew Herbert’s concept of the "audible subject"
[7] in terms of how the context of the source sound is crucial to
the relationships that are built between listener, performer, and
1As discussed in the "Design" section, this is not a technical so much as a design
limitation, as the engine is certainly capable of adding or recording new sounds,
and anyone with a screwdriver and Raspberry Pi experience could load new sounds
into the instrument. However these features are hidden from the user and thus for
the purposes of this work can be considered impossible.

instrument (moving away somewhat from a strict acousmatic
approach).
3 The Design
The Memory Cloud is an instrument based on a granular synthe-
sis engine made in Pure Data. This engine has been developed
over several years and used for a number of different projects2.
The precise nature of the granular code is not important for the
purposes of this paper, and the specifics of granular synthesis
are sufficiently well understood by the NIME community and do
not need to be outlined here. For details on how the instrument
itself functions and sounds please see the instructions document
that is included in the code repository.
The instrument itself is comprised of the granular engine
running on a Raspberry Pi, with a Teensy microcontroller taking
analog control input from the interface elements and sending
them over Serial to the Pure Data patch using thecomport object3.
The interface is made up of 8 knobs, one slider, four switches,
and three buttons. The majority of these controls are mapped
to granular manipulation parameters such as grain size, grain
location, grain direction, pitch and location randomness, etc.
The sounds contained in the instrument are perhaps the most
important, or at least the most distinctive aspect of the Memory
Cloud. Although technically any folder of sounds could be used,
the instrument is intended specifically to contain the sounds
from all of the videos of the user’s personal media library. In
initial tests I used approximately 1,200 audio files extracted from
videos in my own iCloud photo library, dating back 12 years.
The version that was made for a musician (which will form the
bulk of the analysis of this paper) included 2,632 sound files from
roughly 10 years worth of cloud storage.
The sound library works as follows: a folder of sounds is
exported from all of the videos in a user’s cloud library and loaded
into the local memory of the Raspberry Pi. When switched on for
the first time the Pure Data patch in the device will "shuffle" these
sound files and select one to be loaded into the granular synthesis
engine for manipulation. A dedicated button on the instrument
allows the user to change this sound file - when pressed, the next
sound in the shuffled order will be selected and loaded. There

is no way of going back to the previous sound: Each time the
players loads one sound they are also leaving the current sound
behind. In order to play with a sound file a second time, the user
must first load every other sound in the folder.
Preparing, exporting, and transferring these files is something
of an undertaking. The most efficient method I devised involved
downloading all of the videos from an iCloud library to a local
drive, using a command line batch audio processing system (ffm-
peg) to extract the audio, and finally batch converting it with
SoX to the suitable audio format for the granular engine. The
resulting sound files could then be loaded over SSH or USB to
the Raspberry Pi’s local storage.
This process ensures that each Memory Cloud is absolutely
unique. While the engine which creates the sonic output, and the
interface for controlling it, can be seen as a relatively straight-
forward and even fairly standard granular system, the content
that forms the basis of this sonic output is tied inextricably to
the owner of the device.
The initial design of the Memory Cloud took the form of a
first-person Research through Design project, in which I devel-
oped and created the system for my own use using my own
cloud library. The design stems from thinking around sustainabil-
ity issues with regard to cloud storage and cornucopian design
paradigms, as described previously, and the resulting instrument
acts as something to think with [17], with knowledge emerging
[6] from the object itself and its use. Working together with an-
other musician extended this exploration one step further, giving
me a glimpse of another perspective on the instrument and allow-
ing me to play the role of mediator, as the process for setting up
the instrument required a certain amount of specialist guidance.
In this way the device offered a way to expand the inquiry of
the design space beyond my own designing. It and the unfolding
use became a carrier of the research questioning in which I was
engaged around radically small-scale values embedded into the
instrument.
4 Using the Instrument
The Memory Cloud was used for several months by musicians
Sam Beste and Yoshika Colwell, using Sam’s personal sound
library. During the initial familiarization period the instrument
was in Sam’s studio and was used by visitors:
Sam: So it’s just been sort of set up in my stu-
dio, and just as people have been passing through
they’ve been using it, which has been really nice,
and that’s the way that I’ve most enjoyed inter-
acting with it, in a way, is with me playing an in-
strument and somebody else actually playing [The
Memory Cloud] so that there’s an interaction.
After some time it became clear that the instrument could
work well for a concert at a large gallery in London, particularly
as Yoshika built a relationship with it:
Sam: I made this collaborative EP with this singer,
Yoshika, which kind of came together through us
improvising together in a way, and then building
songs out of those improvisations. And so when
we were offered this opportunity to do this thing
at the Gallery, you know, we only have four songs,
and they wanted us to play 40 minutes. And at
first I wasn’t really sure how we would to do that.
But then, actually, when [Yoshika] came into the
studio, the idea was like, well, why don’t we play
the four songs but in between the songs, we sort
of just improvise? And having the Memory Cloud,
it was actually quite a transformative experience
for her, because she’s often been in environments
where she isn’t given control of an instrument, or
she’s...been stuck in certain kind of ways of perceiv-
ing herself and others perceiving her. And actually
having this box, she was completely amazing at
performing with it as well...
Yoshika: I played it a few times leading up to that gig
and then I played it at the gig and it was amazing.
I absolutely love it, it’s one of my favorite things
I’ve ever used. Because I’m not someone who plays
with samplers [or other music technology]. I often
feel slightly alienated by them...With the Memory
Cloud I immediately took to it and I found it very
very accessible, which was so exciting for me.
The inherently personal nature of the device was one of the key
elements that activated the instrument for Yoshika in particular:
Yoshika: The beauty of it is the personalized ele-
ment, so I’m sitting there playing with Sam and I
can hear "oh that’s your kids" and it’s just so beau-
tiful and moving. All of those sounds immediately
have a weight to them, even though I’m not in his
family. There’s something very humanizing about
that, I really like that.
Sam: I think part of her joy in using it was knowing
that it’s completely singular and that it’s completely
related to my own life, and that the things that she’s
relating to and is playing are so personal and it’s
like this sort of process of discovery...That’s what
makes it magical.
The impermanence of the sound selection seems to have been
an important part of what made the instrument work well in this
context, with Sam eventually beginning to see future potential
for building work around it:
Sam: But she also just really loved the concept of
it, and loved how the kind of impermanence of it,
you know that you can’t get attached to anything,
because you’ll never get there again. And that really
worked for the nature of performance, and I think
that kind of impermanent nature of something in
your setup just invites you to kind of be present in a
way, and not be sort of tied to things that are going
to occur every time and you know are going to be
there. It kind of protects you from stagnation in
some way, which I really love. And I’m not entirely
sure how I’m going to live without it, to be honest,
because I sort of feel like I keep imagining ways
that it’s going to be involved in different aspects
[of my work].
As the designer of the object I was surprised to hear from Sam
that he had so readily given this instrument, the sonic contents
of which were so personalized and particular to his own life, over
to others to play. However he explained that this was a result
of his desire to respond musically (mainly through the piano) to
processed sound recordings:
Sam: It has fit so well into a world that I was al-
ready exploring, but didn’t have a means of doing
it in a kind of this generative way, live. And so it
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Seznec
was always going to be somebody else playing it in
a way, because I’m always interested in the inter-
action between the piano and sound...So actually,
having somebody else control it sort of just makes
a lot of sense.
5 Reflections
The use of the Memory Cloud suggests three specific themes
that can be discussed here: the specific potential of radical small
scale design, how the design of the instrument can be seen as
a constraint that encourages creative output, and how the use
personal sounds acts as a musical affordance.
5.1 Radically microscale design, politics and
longevity
The Memory Cloud is an instrument that demands care. From
the outset, my own role of designer involves a significant amount
of practical work and guidance, with the eventual goal of col-
lecting a user’s own personal sounds and creating a customized
version of the instrument. On the one hand this is an illustration
of the inefficiency and biases of the technological systems that
we are entangled with. Each step of the process is frictional and
demonstrates how the systems on which we rely for managing
our personal media are simply not designed for these purposes.
Clicking and dragging 2000 video files from a photo manage-
ment application immediately creates graphical and functional
slowdowns of the operating system even on a relatively new com-
puter. Exporting that many files is simply not expected behaviour
- the iCloud browser system, for example, only allows a user to
download 1000 videos at a time (and does not function reliably).
Indeed, the process of creating Sam’s Memory Cloud from his
cloud library was challenging. I needed to guide him through
the process of exporting his entire video library from iCloud,
installing and using command line batch processing tools for
the first time, and sending me the resulting sounds to load onto
the instrument. Working through these steps with Sam, whilst
living in two different countries, took several days (and many
text messages), and gave him some understanding of both the
scale and power of his own media:
text message from Sam: in trying to find a way
through i accidentally opened all 4.5k videos4 with
quicktime omg! it almost collapsed my system!
haha! But was really emotional to see all the videos
popping up one by one...quite amazing that we have
this archive of our lives
This process was essentially reactivating a relationship be-
tween Sam and his own media library, a relationship in which I
as the designer was acting as something of a mediator or guide,
carefully helping him collect and prepare his personal memories
for use in his own instrument.
While the technical system that underpins the Memory Cloud
is a relatively straightforward granular synthesis engine, the use
of the personal media library as the only sonic content avail-
able in the instrument is a constraint that serves to strengthen
its emotional power. The Memory Cloud takes a radically anti-
innovation approach that explicitly uses an existing technical
engine and instead is about building a connection between a
specific user and their own personal memories. Put simply, each
4the final number was smaller due to file compatibility, doubles, and naming issues,
but was deemed sufficient in any case
Memory Cloud is unabashedly a singular instrument for a single
person. My own Memory Cloud could not possibly have the same
power for someone else - and that is precisely the point.
Thus the core elements that come together to form what I call
"radically microscale design" are:
• A user willing to engage with their own media library and
confront the biases embedded in our technologies
• A thoughtful and caring relationship between designer
and user
• An overt avoidance of technological innovation
The way this concept dovetails with sustainability and com-
puting issues as detailed in the background also points towards a
form of media reuse, which could form the basis of more work in
the NIME community. Where systems such as sample libraries,
physical modeling, and latent spaces all push for creating new
sounds, what about the thousands of sounds that we are all car-
rying around in our pockets? Perhaps these sounds are worth
considering as material for creative expression - particularly as
many of them will contain far more emotional weight than any-
thing generated by machine learning or other methods. Therein
lies the political stance in the work, which is both embedded into
the design of the instrument and is revealed through setup and
use.
The way this was manifested in the Memory Cloud, through
the use of the vast personal library spanning a number of years,
prompted reflections from Yoshika around the nature of these
sounds and how they differ from musical material that is often
used in musical composition and performance:
Yoshika: It’s such a scrapbook of somebody’s life, so
intimate. That ambient noise, it’s not constructed,
which does resonate with the philosophy of the [in-
strument]. It’s like...all of the background stuff is
all of the important stuff, really. The stuff of every-
day life, the noise, the laughing, the rustling, it’s
not performative in any way. And I think that is
so mirrored in the instrument, because it feels like
it’s a tool to stimulate your thoughts about those
sounds.
It has been suggested that a preoccupation with technical
innovation and an avoidance of political stances has potentially
contributed to the problems with NIME longevity [13]. I would
like to position the Memory Cloud within these discussions that
have taken place within the NIME community, suggesting that
the creative process for this instrument stemmed from a specific
political stance based on anti-solutionism, sustainable HCI, care,
and radically small scale design. Whether or not this results in
an instrument with longevity remains to be seen, but I present
this work as a way of attempting to actively engage with the
discussions.
5.2 Constraints of personal sonic material
Having briefly touched upon the results of a constraints-led de-
sign process, it is worth considering exactly how these are applied
in the design of the instrument and how the resulting interaction
manifests.
It is immediately noticeable that the instrument itself has
no screen. Whilst some discussions around musical instrument
design has suggested that moving away from screens might be a
small step towards sustainability [19], in practice there are also
cost and technical reasons for this approach. The instrument runs
on a Raspberry Pi, which could certainly have a screen attached

Figure 3: Choose a new sound, leave the old sound behind
through HDMI, but integrating this into the user interface would
likely have created more problems than it solved. Nevertheless
an instrument that requires a sound file to be loaded in order to
start making sound (and contains potentially thousands of files
to load) will certainly require some method of choosing a sound
file to load.
This constraint is what led to the button for loading the sound
into the granular engine. This button is prominently featured in
the middle of the device, accompanied by an explanation (Figure
3). As mentioned earlier, the entire sound library is shuffled, so
the order of loading the sounds is predetermined but unknown to
the player.5 The next sound file may be from a video recorded on
the same day as the previous, or could be years apart. It could be a
short clip of a rehearsal or it could be the sound of a dog running
on a beach. The only thing that is certain is that pressing the
button will leave the current sound behind, and you will not hear
it again until you have heard every other sound in the library -
with over 2000 sounds in Sam’s library it is unlikely that he will
be hearing any given sound again any time soon.
There is a peculiar balance to this, where there is a combination
of unknown (which sound will come next) and known (all of the
sounds are from a single and personal source). It is likely that the
player will recognize any given sound, though the order in which
they are presented will be surprising and potentially jarring. This
mirrors the dual nature of the design constraint - on the one hand
this is an instrument filled with a staggering amount of sonic
content. In Sam’s case the total size of the library came to 46
gigabytes, or roughly 80 hours of audio. This could, admittedly,
be seen as adopting the very cornucopian design paradigm that I
was trying to avoid, in the sense of providing the user not just
with quite a lot of sounds, but with every single sound they have
ever recorded. However, by only providing a single button as the
interface for selecting a sound (and by overtly avoiding a screen
to enable selection or give information on upcoming files), this
glut of sound is transformed instead into a constraint where each
button press must be carefully considered. Is it time for a new
sound? Is it worth sticking with this one a bit longer? When will
I hear it again?
For Yoshika in particular this constraint was a liberating expe-
rience from her very first time playing the Memory Cloud:
Yoshika: I was playing one sample and [Sam] was
like "the fun thing about it is you go forward and
you can never get back [to the previous sound]"...So
you can never get attached to it, which I absolutely
love. And immediately you make your peace with
that, just psychologicaly for me, you can’t get stuck.
I think that’s because you immediately accept that
you can’t be attached to a sound...I think in terms
of not being attached, and how generative that is
5When the device is switched on it will automatically reload the same sound that
was in the buffer when the instrument was switched off. The shuffled order is
retained.
creatively, I think that’s amazing and very freeing
because you feel like you are improvising with it, it
feels like a two way thing with the machine...you’re
not attached to the outcome being exactly the same.
You want to capture the feeling and the essence
rather than keep something in a very constricted
space.
5.3 Personal media as affordance
Sam’s relation with his Memory Cloud was intensely personal,
describing it as "singular and...completely related to my own
life". This is perhaps not surprising as it contained only his own
sounds from his own media library, though it also seems likely
that the process of exporting the videos and preparing the sounds
contributed also to his connection to the finished instrument.
Playing the instrument did not exist in a vacuum - Sam began
building a relationship with the library of sounds well before he
received the Memory Box in the post. By the time he received it
he was already aware of the personal nature of the sounds that
it would create, as well as having a handle on the sheer quantity
of files and the associated technical challenges of using them.
These interwoven relationships between myself (the designer),
Sam and Yoshika (the performers), the instrument, and the per-
sonal media content can be seen as reflecting the complex and
entangled nature of musicking with technology [ 10, 21]. The
Memory Cloud creates affordances not primarily through inter-
face or sound design, but instead through the use of personal
media. It leverages sonic content which by its very existence will
already be filled with meaning, particularly for the one individual
who created that content. The affordances that make the Memory
Cloud function are built upon and with the user’s past - poten-
tially years of memories that are re-configured and presented
back to the creator, generating encounters with their own history
and giving the opportunity to dissect a singular moment from
their own experience.
6 Conclusion
The Memory Cloud is an instrument that uses personal media
to generate new affordances for musical interaction. It leverages
our vast libraries of videos towards a radically small scale and
personal experience, embracing constraints as a design strategy
and a political stance.
7 Ethical Standards
This research took place at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in
the context of my doctoral studies. The research is exempt from
formal ethical approval under the interpretation of Swedish law6.
Data collection does not directly relate to sensitive personal data.
The musicians involved in testing the instrument (Sam Beste
and Yoshika Colwell) were informed from the beginning of the
research context of the work and Sam fully consented to using his
own sound recordings in the instrument, aware that this formed
an integral part of the design of the instrument and the resulting
research. Both Sam and Yoshika consented to our conversations
being recorded and transcribed for the paper. They were not
compensated financially for their participation. The research also
necessarily involved the use of my own personal media library in
the development of the instrument. While my supervisory team

was fully supportive of this work, the use of my own sounds
was entirely of my own volition and was not the result of any
coercion from supervisors or anyone else in a position of power.
