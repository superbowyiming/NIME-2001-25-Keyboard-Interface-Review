ABSTRACT
The Electrosteel is a new electronic instrument inspired by
the user interface of the pedal steel guitar (PSG). The Elec-
trosteel uses the interface concepts of the PSG (a bar in the
left hand, plucked strings for the right hand, foot pedals,
knee levers, etc) as a control paradigm for digital synthesis.
The instrument allows performers with skill on the PSG to
expand their sonic range, and creates a powerful new multi-
dimensional way to control synthesis. This paper describes
the development of the instrument and its custom embed-
ded synthesis engine, with a focus on the design challenges
posed by mapping an existing performer interface to a new
instrument.

1. INTRODUCTION
The initial sonic idea of the Electrosteel (Figure 1) was to
enable the coupling of the musical gestures that the PSG’s
distinct interface makes possible with electronic sounds that
are timbrally different, for instance 8-bit chiptunes synthe-
sis. Unlike systems like the IVL Steelrider 1, which used
pitch-tracking on a PSG and converted pitch information
to MIDI, the Electrosteel employs a PSG-like physical in-
terface to control synthesis directly, enabling the pedals and
levers to do bends and timbral shifts that are physically im-
possible on a PSG.
2. THE PEDAL STEEL GUITAR
Invented in the mid-1950s, the modern PSG is a slide guitar
with foot pedals and knee levers that alter the pitch of the

open strings to shift which chords and intervals are avail-
able to the player. Ultimately a descendent of the Hawaiian
lap steel guitar, its design was directly informed by pedal-
activated instruments developed in the 1930s and 1940s such
as the Gibson Electro-Harp and the Multi-Kord. For a de-
tailed overview of its history, see Miller[16]. Today, it is
most often associated with American country music, where
it provides the expressive“crying”sound[3], marked by com-
plex pedal glissandos, that is a strong signifier of the genre.
Notable country players include Buddy Emmons (who is
credited with many of the initial technical innovations that
standardized the modern version of the PSG[6]), and Lloyd
Green. It is also the central instrument in the “sacred
steel” gospel tradition[23], with players like Robert Ran-
dolph pushing the instrument in a different stylistic direc-
tion, employing rapid-fire single-note voice emulation that
could be compared to a bluesy shout. Unfortunately, out-
side of these genres, the instrument is very rarely heard.
Notable exceptions include Susan Alcorn, who performs ex-
perimental music on the PSG, and Greg Leisz and BJ Cole
who play pedal steel on jazz, pop, and rock recordings.
The PSG’s unusual interface provides a remarkable level
of control and subtlety. The bar – a sliding metal piece
guided by the player’s left hand – gives continuous control
of pitch and vibrato. Pedals and knee levers allow players
to bend the intervals between strings. Unlike the pedals
on a concert harp, the PSG’s pedals and levers create a
continuous change. This allows the player to slide pitch in-
dependently of the bar, enabling chords whose notes move
with independent speed and direction. Some electronic con-
tinuous MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) interfaces like
the Haken Continuum[8], the TouchKeys[15], or the Roli
Seaboard2, can achieve a similar effect through hand con-
trols. However, the PSG’s distribution of control among the
hands, knees and feet preserves the independence of voices
in a unique way. It also allows for vibrato to be easily syn-
chronized between the voices, as the vibrato is created by
the bar and applies to all strings. The Electrosteel seeks to
offer the musician a similar mode of expression.
3. THE GOALS OF THE ELECTROSTEEL
The Electrosteel is an electronic instrument that mimics
the performance interface of the PSG, while offering the ex-
panded timbral world of a modern synthesis engine. The
goal is to leverage existing sensorimotor skills of PSG play-
ers on the new instrument, enabling more rapid embodiment
of the instrument for the player, and therefore increasing ac-
cess to musical expressivity[7]. Unlike PSG MIDI pickups,
for instance, the Electrosteel is not intended to, for instance,
let a PSG player sound like a saxophone, but rather to put
electronic synthesis under the finely expressive musical con-
trol that an experienced PSG player can produce. While
the Electrosteel is not intended as a replacement for a PSG,
there are some practical advantages when compared to a
PSG. The instrument is much lighter and more portable
than the PSG, which is notoriously heavy and cumbersome.
Also, the Electrosteel’s single neck is able to operate in
several selectable tunings, while PSGs are often built with
multiple necks to support different tunings. While there
have been several electronic musical instrument that bor-
row inspiration from the slide guitar[9][19], and one that
is inspired by the PSG[10], the authors are not aware of
another instrument that approaches this concept with the
depth of the Electrosteel.
4. IDENTIFYING THE IMPORTANT PSG
INTERFACE FEATURES
The first task in the development of the Electrosteel was to
determine which interface elements of the PSG were impor-
tant to preserve, and which could be simplified or removed.
By learning basic PSG techniques and some repertoire, the
first author was able identify the essential elements that
give the PSG its expressive potential. The following com-
ponents were considered essential: The left-hand bar, right-
hand plucking and muting, right-foot volume pedal, left-
foot pedals, knee levers, and additional right-hand controls.
The development of each of these elements of the Electros-
teel is described below.
5. THE ELECTROSTEEL INTERFACE EL-
EMENTS
5.1 Left Hand Bar
On the PSG, the bar is held in the left hand and rests on the
strings, which are strung about 7mm above the neck. On
the neck there is a printed “fretboard” pattern to provide a
visual reference for pitch location. While some players, such
as Buddy Emmons, have trained themselves to be able to
play without the fretboard reference[6], it is extremely un-
usual to do so. The feel of the bar in the hand is a major
element of the performer’s sense of the instrument - and the
weight and shape of the bar contribute to the left-hand ges-
tures used by players. This suggests that an interface that
2https://roli.com/products/seaboard/rise2
seeks to capture this expression should include an actual
physical bar, and a sensor to read its position on a neck
that features visual fret markers. The naive solution to the
bar position problem would be a voltage-divider approach,
with the linear strip connected to power and ground at each
side and the bar forming the wiper. Unfortunately, this is
not usable since the left hand rests on the strings behind
the bar, confounding the readings, so another approach is
needed. The first attempt at an emulation of the bar inter-
face was the employment of a single commercially available
“soft pot” linear position sensor. Unfortunately, actuation
force was too high to provide comfortable slide gestures, as
it required the player to press down harder on the sensor
than standard PSG technique calls for. The next iteration
involved a custom sensor inspired by the soft pot technol-
ogy and ribbon controllers: a resistive strip was printed on
a custom PCB using carbon ink, and a guitar string was
strung above it, with only a 1mm gap between them. In
performance, the bar presses the string to the resistive strip,
closing the circuit. The side of the resistive strip closest to
the bridge is driven with a constant-current DAC at a low
current (50uA) through a fixed resistor, and the string is
grounded. With this technique, the ratio between the volt-
age across the variable resistance and the voltage across the
fixed resistance is reasonably linear (Figure 2).

This was found to be effective, although the actuation
force is still slightly higher than a player would expect. Also,
higher bar positions require more actuation force, since the
string must be raised more at the bridge position to make
sure the string rises from the sensor PCB at a clean angle
from the bar.
Once the instrument was playable, it was determined that
a single sensor for the bar is not enough for some modes
of playing. To allow for “bar slants” and subtle variations
of the bar angle across the strings, a second sensor was
added to the neck, and the position between the two sen-
sors interpolated to find the position of the bar over each
virtual “string”. Higher numbers of linear position sensors
were tried but any number of sensors beyond two increases
the likelihood that a sensor won’t be pressed enough if the
strings aren’t completely level on the neck, and the added
sensor noise was determined to be not worth the additional
data.
From the player’s perspective, two simplifications on the
left-hand bar interface of the Electrosteel are particularly
noticeable and require some player adjustment from their
PSG technique. One is that a PSG player actually moves
the bar toward and away from their body as they play, only
pressing the bar against the highest string they are actually
sounding. On the PSG, this serves two purposes: it pro-
duces the cleanest tone from the bar and it allows the fin-
gers of the left hand that fall behind the bar to mute higher
strings as the bar is moved closer to the player. This mo-
tion is unnecessary on the Electrosteel, and actually would
cause the player to move the bar off of the strings. The fact
that “left-hand muting” with the fingers is not possible on
Electrosteel can be a serious issue if the player relies on that
technique. There are several schools of thought on muting
in PSG practice, and some players avoid this muting style,
so this simplification will affect some more than others. The
other important simplification is that on a PSG, the player
can put the bar over some strings and leave other strings
open. This is not possible with the two-sensor system that
is currently on the Electrosteel, but it is also a relatively
uncommon technique on the PSG.
5.2 Right Hand Plucking System
On the PSG, the right hand technique is one of the most
difficult parts of the instrument to master. The sustain of
the strings is very long, so to play single-note lines cleanly,
one must constantly be muting the sounding strings at the
exact moment that a new string is plucked. For the Elec-
trosteel, a decoupling of decay time and sustain level from
the physical realities of a vibrating string was desired to in-
crease the flexibility of the sound synthesis. Therefore, the
goal of the right-hand plucking system was to detect pluck
events (with amplitude) and mute events, but nothing fur-
ther.
PSGs usually have either 10 or 12 strings. Any reduction
in the number of strings for the right hand would make nor-
mal PSG playing technique impossible, so it was decided to
design a 12-string system (10-string players can remove the
bottom 2 strings). While there are many possible technolo-
gies that could be used, such as a set of piezo film flaps or
buttons to represent the strings, the feel of the strings under
the fingers is an important touch cue for playing the PSG,
so the decision was made to preserve that as much as possi-
ble. A short set of 12 strings was strung over a bridge and
nut (Figure 3) under the right hand position, damped with
felt on both ends. To reduce crosstalk, optical IR reflectance
sensors were used to detect string motion (QRD1113), since
the IR light could be blocked between strings more easily
than electromagnetic fields. However, this only works well if
the strings are relatively thick and very close to the sensors,
meaning that the strings cannot be the standard gauges
PSG players are used to. Tests with PSG players found
that this was confusing as they often use the transition
from wound to unwound strings as a visual place marker
to keep their orientation on the many strings. Also, the IR
sensors are particularly sensitive to positioning (which the
felt damping makes less reliable) so it is likely that a future
version will switch to single-string electromagnetic pickups
and work to reduce crosstalk in other ways. Another poten-
tially interesting solution would be piezo strings [5], if the
technology evolves to allow for normal string tension.
Plucks are detected using a relatively simple envelope de-
tection algorithm, running on an STM32H750 microcon-
troller. The 12 strings are sensed by the built-in ADC,
and when a pluck is sensed, an SPI message is sent to a
PSOC5LP serving as the “brain” MCU.
Muting was achieved by having the strings themselves
serve as capacitive touch sensors. A PSOC5LP microcon-
troller performs both the string-muting sensing and the bar-
position sensing, and sends these signals to the“brain”MCU
via SPI.

nut for the right-hand strings
5.3 Right-Foot Volume Pedal
While for standard guitar a volume pedal would be an op-
tional accessory, on the PSG it is an integral part. The vol-
ume pedal has been a necessary feature of the instrument
since the 1950s, and there is a particular technique for in-
creasing the perception of sustain by easing up the volume
after striking the strings, a kind of “manual compression”.
On the Electrosteel, an expression pedal was substituted for
this so that it could affect parameters beyond volume. Ac-
cordingly, a miniature expression pedal is connected to the
left-foot pedal board by a TRS cable, where it is sensed by
an ADC.
5.4 Left-Foot Pedals
The left-foot on a PSG activates a set of between three
(3) and eight (8) pedals that connect via metal rods to the
underside of the instrument. These rods, through a series
of mechanical linkages, pull on a set of individual per-string
bridges, called the changers, which rotate on a fulcrum to
adjust the tension on the string. Since there is no need
in the Electrosteel for actual mechanical changing of string
length, simplification of this mechanism, while preserving
the feel and functionality for the player, was desirable. The
pedal and changer simplification accounts for much of the
weight difference between Electrosteel and the PSG. Over
the course of the Electrosteel project, the left-foot pedal
system proved to be the most difficult design challenge on
the instrument.
Figure 4: Design drawing of the left-foot pedal system, un-
covered
The first and simplest iteration for the proof-of-concept
version was simply a plywood board with the pedal mecha-
nisms from three Yamaha FC3A continuous sustain pedals
attached to it. These foot pedals are designed to be used
with an electronic keyboard that senses half-pedaling, so
they are actually a continuous potentiometer-based pedal,
rather than a switch. They were somewhat larger than the
pedals on a PSG, so the spacing between them was not
ideal, but they worked well enough for initial tests. The
next iteration, and first custom solution, used 3D-printed
plastic parts for the pedals and the mounting hub, with po-
tentiometers for sensing the pedal angle and small extension
springs to return the pedal to its initial position. Later it-
erations abandoned the direct potentiometer approach, to
avoid reliance on the shaft connection of the potentiometer
as a mechanical support, and due to concerns about rapidly
wearing out the resistive material in the potentiometers, as
the pedals are moved constantly in normal playing. The po-
tentiometers were replaced with angular hall sensors paired
with magnets glued to the end of the shafts. The shafts
were supported on sets of ball bearings, and the pedals were
affixed to the shafts with set screws.
Figure 5: Photograph of the left-foot pedal system, with en-
closure cover in place
Many of the iterations of the foot pedal system were mo-
tivated by the need to replace plastic parts with metal for
increased rigidity, as the pedals take significant forces in
many different directions (the player may roll their foot
onto a pedal from either side, or come down from the top,
for instance). The shape of the pedals themselves also un-
derwent much iteration, as the original square edges were
found to catch on shoe soles, and needed to be rounded
off. The small extension springs were replaced with larger
compression springs underneath the pedals, a design fea-
ture borrowed from the Yamaha FC3A, and one that made
switching out the springs to adjust spring strength easier
for the player. The final system used custom CNC-milled
aluminum parts for the pedals and off-the-shelf aluminum
parts for the bearings, shaft, and mounting block (Figure 4).
The mounting block that holds the shaft is fitted with a
custom part that allows for set screws to adjust the stop
points for the resting and pressed positions of the pedals,
which must be adjustable by the player and therefore needed
to be exposed on the design. This is because PSG perform-
ers tend to set the pedals to different heights relative to
each other by their own preference (for instance: first pedal
slightly higher resting state than second pedal). Since the
start and stop data are relative and can be changed by the
user, the brain MCU of the instrument has a calibration
mode that can record the range of the pedal data and store
it in EEPROM.
The earlier revisions were housed in a custom cut 5mm
thick aluminum enclosure, but the final revision replaced
this with a custom bent steel enclosure design to reduce
thickness and part count. The enclosure features a TRS
jack to connect the external right-foot volume pedal, and
an RJ-45 jack to connect the pedal system to the brain of
the instrument through a standard ethernet cable (though
the actual signal protocol reporting the hall sensor and ex-
pression pedal ADC data is I2C).
Since the number of foot pedals on a PSG is not stan-
dardized, it was difficult to decide on how many pedals the
Electrosteel should have. Three pedals is enough for many
things, but more pedals allow for more flexibility. The Elec-
trosteel prototype began with three pedals, grew to 7 pedals
at one point, and then settled at 5 pedals in its last iteration
as a compromise between flexibility, cost, and weight.
5.5 Knee Levers
In the early 1960s, knee levers became common on the PSG.
Like the left-foot pedals, these levers are used to change the
pitch of the open strings. Most PSGs have at minimum two
knee levers, although some have up to 8. 5 is a common
complement of knee levers, as it can include levers in the
left and right directions for both knees, as well as a single
vertical lever for the left knee. Beyond this, PSGs some-
times include “inner” and “outer” levers for the same direc-
tion on one knee, meaning separate levers that are closer or
further from the player, although these are generally harder
to activate independently. A vertical lever on the right knee
is harder to use because the position of the foot on the vol-
ume pedal allows for less knee flexibility. A complement of
5 levers was decided upon as a reasonable amount for the
Electrosteel, providing the most flexibility before the added
complexity begins to be hard to justify.
Figure 6: Drawing of the Electrosteel, underside view
As the knee levers add significant cost and mechanical
complexity to the instrument, one early idea for the Elec-
trosteel was to manage the functionality with a greatly sim-
plified system, such as IR position sensors for the knees,
or something else that eliminates moving parts. Unfortu-
nately, this is not realistic if the goal of harnessing existing
embodiment from PSG technique is taken seriously, as the
physical feedback of the knee lever moving and its resis-
tance to movement is an important part of controlling the
instrument[21]. Even more important is the existence of me-
Figure 7: Photograph of the Electrosteel, underside view
chanical stops to end the lever travel so that exact pitches
can be arrived at following a glissando. Therefore, it was
clearly necessary to build a mechanical knee lever system to
provide the proper feedback to the player, even if this me-
chanical system was only resolving into a relatively simple
sensor reading.
Figure 8: An Electrosteel knee lever mechanism
With this in mind, one early design goal was to have as
much reuse as possible between the left-foot pedal system
and the knee levers, as they are almost the same thing, just
rotated 90 degrees. The foot pedals protrude parallel to
the ground toward the player, and the knee levers emerge
from the bottom of the instrument and hang downward, but
their range of travel is similar. This goal was achieved to
some degree, as the hall sensor, mounting block and shaft
design could be reused easily, although changes were needed
for the levers themselves. While the foot pedals could be
constructed as a single part mounted to the rotating shaft
by a set screw, the knee levers needed to fold up under the
instrument for transport, necessitating another point of ro-
tation. The knee levers were therefore fabricated as two
parts: a hub and a lever (Figure 8). The lever is connected
to the hub with a shoulder screw that allows it to pivot
in one direction. The hub is then connected to the rotat-
ing shaft with a set screw. For the knee levers, the small
extension spring version of the return system was needed,
since there is no readily available surface against which to
place a compression spring. On a PSG, there are points for
adjustment on the knee levers available to the player via
set screws to allow the instrument to accommodate play-
ers of different body sizes. This design was copied on the
Electrosteel, with each knee lever hub featuring a set screw
that angles the lever toward the player. This allows the
mounting blocks to be relatively far from the center of the
player’s leg, and therefore able to be adjusted for leg size
and position.
5.6 Additional Right-Hand Controls
It was determined that additional controls not present on a
PSG would be useful on the Electrosteel. While the pedals
and knee levers could provide a powerful collection of tim-
bre controls for synthesis, if a player is instead using them
to manipulate pitch as on a traditional PSG, then a set of
knobs would be helpful to adjust other synthesis parame-
ters. While this is motivated primarily by the fact that the
sound palette of the Electrosteel can be far wider than the
PSG, it is also especially needed because the Electrosteel
interface loses some of the most important timbral controls
of the PSG instrument, such as sensitivity to plucking po-
sition on the string. For this purpose, near the right hand,
the Electrosteel features a panel with two knobs, labeled A
and B, and a small 2D joystick. Other functions were added
as needed, such as octave buttons and an OLED screen for
synthesis preset loading.

Electrosteel body
6. AUDIO SYNTHESIS ENGINE
Since the goal of the Electrosteel was to allow electronic
synthesis to be controlled with the expressivity of the PSG
interface, it made sense to create a digital synthesis engine
that was designed to take advantage of the control the Elec-
trosteel offered. Early prototyping treated the Electrosteel
as an MPE USB-MIDI controller and interpreted the in-
coming data with Max-MSP patches and various commer-
cial software synthesizers that could respond to MPE data
(necessary due to the independent per-string pitch bend ca-
pability). This was useful when testing the sensor data and
mechanics of the instrument, but the ultimate intention
was always to have a custom synthesis engine embedded
in the instrument. Later revisions achieved this goal, with
onboard synthesis algorithms producing digital sound and
sending the audio signal to a 1/4” TS output jack on the
Electrosteel front panel.
Embedded synthesis was implemented using the first au-
thor’s Genera Audio Board, a development board that in-
cludes an STM32H743, an audio codec, SDRAM, and a
microSD card slot. The requirement for 12-note polyphony,
which was crucial for enabling traditional PSG playing on
the Electrosteel, was a significant challenge. A custom PCB
was designed which housed three Genera Audio Boards, so
that each would only need to serve 4 notes out of the 12.
Three methods of embedded synthesis were initially tested
on the prototype: subtractive wavetable synthesis, additive
synthesis, and physical modeling. All three methods were
implemented using the first author’s LEAF C audio library
(Lightweight Embedded Audio Framework), and found to
be promising. For additive synthesis, a PSG’s plucked strings
were recorded at several positions on the neck on each string.
The decay times of the harmonics for each pluck were ana-
lyzed in SPEAR[13], and a table of these decay times was
used to extrapolate envelopes for a set of sine waves. This
produced a relatively realistic PSG tone, even reproduc-
ing the darkening of the tone color as the bar is moved
up the neck, since the bar position was maintained as a
separate variable from pitch. Missing from the simulation
were more subtle effects like pick noise, inharmonicity, and
phantom harmonics. Lastly, a physical modeling approach
was attempted and found to be very effective. The string
model used was based on the living string model by Dahlst-
edt[4], with several modifications based on research from
Smith[22], Lasko [14], Valimaki [24], and Karjalainen [12].
After developing these three synthesis methods, it became
Figure 11: The Electrosteel synthesis plugin
clear that more flexibility in the synthesis design for the end
user was needed. We began to develop an audio plugin that
would enable the user to configure a specific synthesis pre-
set on a computer, load it to the Electrosteel, and call it up
later in performance(Figure 11). This became the Electros-
teel plugin, created in C++ using the JUCE library 3, and
primarily developed by the second and third authors Matt
Wang and Davis Polito at the Princeton New Instrument
Research Lab (NIRL). So far only the subtractive synthesis
method has been built into the plugin. The plugin fea-
tures three hard-syncable oscillators with selectable wave-
shape[2], a filtered noise section, two filters with selectable
algorithms[25], a set of 4 mappable LFOs and 4 envelopes,
a final VCA, and an FX section with a variety of processing
options (compression, bitcrushing, etc). Most parameters
can be mapped by the user to be controlled by one of the
possible modulation sources, which range from the oscil-
lator outputs (enabling FM effects) to the joystick on the
panel. When a synthesis preset has been designed using
the Electrosteel plugin, it can be loaded onto the embedded
hardware over USB-MIDI sysex and stored as one of the
user synthesis presets on the instrument’s internal microSD
card. While this synthesis method was powerful, it was too
computationally intensive for 4-voice polyphony per audio
board. It was deemed worth adding more parallel process-
ing to make it possible, so the number of audio boards was
increased to 6, letting each board handle only two voices.
7. COPEDENT DESIGN
On a PSG, the configuration of which pedal or knee lever
does what change is referred to as a copedent (for ChOrd-
PEDal-ArrangemENT). One of the most exciting capabili-
ties of the Electrosteel when compared with a PSG is the
ability to change the copedent on the fly. On a PSG, chang-
ing the copedent often must be done by a technician, and
will usually take at least a day. There are also physical lim-
its to what a pedal or lever can do, as the number of strings
changed increases the stiffness of the pedal action, and most
strings can only be altered up or down by at most a minor
third. These limitations are nonexistent in the Electros-
teel, but an interface was still needed to allow the player
to configure new copedents as easily as possible. This was
built into the Electrosteel plugin with a copedent editor tab
(Figure 12) that lets the user enter the pitches of the open
strings and all the changes that each pedal or lever causes.
Figure 12: The Electrosteel plugin copedent settings window
In the interface, pitches can be entered as note names
with cents deviations (such as C4 + 4), MIDI notes (such
3https://juce.com/
as 60.04), or pitch ratios (such as 5/4). Internally, all val-
ues are converted to fractional MIDI notes (such as 60.25).
Copedents are sent over USB-MIDI sysex messages to the
Electrosteel for storage on the brain MCU EEPROM.
8. RESULTS
The Electrosteel had been played constantly during its multi-
year development, but its first public performance occurred
on January 3rd, 2023 at the Red Room in Baltimore. It was
played by the first author in an improvisational duo with
another electronic musician, and proved to live up to the
authors’ hopes for the instrument. However, now that the
instrument is in a mature state, more user data is needed
to determine the success and usefulness of the instrument.
During the development phase, one professional PSG player
tried it out and gave valuable feedback, and more feedback
of this type is needed.
The PSG is both a rare and a famously difficult instru-
ment, and that combination means that there are few skilled
players in the world. Since the Electrosteel is designed to
take advantage of PSG skill, the most useful data in the
future will be from professional performers who test out the
Electrosteel in their own practice. This is the next goal of
the project.
9. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
There are several aspects of the instrument that need im-
provement. The left-foot pedal box currently slides on some
surfaces, so the addition of a “pedal-bar” to hold it in place
is likely necessary. The left-hand bar sensing system could
use improvement, as it requires slightly more effort from the
player than a traditional PSG. Perhaps a bar that is sensed
directly rather than indirectly through strings pressed against
a circuit board would give a better feel, so magnetic posi-
tion sensing through hall sensors or other location sensing
could be used.
The next step on the plugin is to integrate the physical
modeling synthesis and additive synthesis into the plugin
interface, so that they can be configured as easily as the
subtractive synthesis.
Another plan is to develop the physical modeling synthe-
sis further to take into account other effects such as bar fric-
tion noise[18], phantom partials[1], inharmonicity[20], and
electromagnetic pickup modeling[11][17] . The most impor-
tant next step is to get the instrument in the hands of more
players and receive feedback on where it excels and where it
fails. We have the parts made for a set of 10 Electrosteels,
and a list of players who are interested in borrowing one to
test for their own musical uses. It is anticipated that this
will reveal shortcomings and opportunities that the design-
ers have not yet noticed.
Now that the Electrosteel is fully playable, the most press-
ing future work is to create music for it, both composed and
improvised, and in multiple genre contexts, to see where it
shines and where its unique features are most useful.

This project was undertaken within the standards of the
NIME ethical code of conduct. A formal user study was
not conducted as part of this research, so no ethical issues
relating to study subjects were encountered. The authors
acknowledge that this work does, however, make use of in-
dustrial fabrication processes (custom PCB fabrication and
assembly, anodizing aluminum, etc) which contribute to en-
vironmental damage.
