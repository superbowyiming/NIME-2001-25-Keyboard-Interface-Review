ABSTRACT
Musical instruments have a long history, and many types
of musical instruments have been created to attain ideal
sound production. At the same time, various types of elec-
tronic musical instruments have been developed. Since the
main purpose of conventional electronic instruments is to
duplicate the shape of acoustic instruments with no change
in their hardware conﬁguration, the diapason and the per-
formance style of each instrument is inﬂexible. Therefore,
the goal of our study is to construct theUnitInstrument
that consists of various types of musical units. A unit is
constructed by simulating functional elements of conven-
tional musical instruments, such as output timing of sound
and pitch decision. Each unit has connectors for connect-
ing other units to create various types of musical instru-
ments. Additionally, we propose a language for easily and
ﬂexibly describing the settings of units. We evaluated the
eﬀectiveness of our proposed system by using it in actual
performances.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the long history of musical instruments, many types of
musical instruments such as wind, string, percussion, and
keyboard have been developed. At the same time, various
types of electronic musical instruments were developed such
as digital pianos and electronic guitars. These erectronic
instruments have many functions such as diapason change
and tone change.
However, the main aim of most conventional electronic in-
struments is to duplicate the shape of acoustic instruments,
their hardware conﬁguration cannot be easily changed. This
means that the performance style of each instrument is in-
ﬂexible. For example, pianists cannot play music composed
for the organ with dual manuals using a digital piano with
a single manual, and guitarists cannot play music for a long
scale guitar with 24 frets with a short scale guitar with 12
frets.

Therefore, the goal of our study is to construct theUnitIn-
strument, which consists of various types of musical units.
We assume that most musical instruments can be catego-
rized by functional properties. A unit is a functional ele-
ment of a conventional musical instrument, such as output
timing of sound and pitch decision. Figure 1 shows the
concept of ourUnitInstrument and examples of units and
their combinations. The ﬁgure shows aKeyboardUnit with
only 12 keys (seven white and ﬁve black) and aFingerboar-
dUnit with only four frets. We can build various instru-
ment conﬁgurations by combining multiple units, as shown
at the bottom of this ﬁgure. The diapason and conﬁgu-
ration of musical instruments are extended to combine the
same types of units, and new musical instruments can be
created by combining diﬀerent types of units. For example,
by connecting thePickupUnit of a guitar with aKeyboard-
Unit, we construct a new keyboard that can easily produce
vibrato. Additionally, we propose a language for easily and
ﬂexibly deﬁne the settings of units.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 explains related work. Section 3 describes the design
of UnitInstrument and Section 4 presents the implementa-
tion of a prototype system. Finally, Section 5 describes
conclusions and our planned future work.
2. RELATED WORK
There is a large amount of research whose main goal is
the improvement of system functions by combining simple
functional units. For example, users can control an object in
a video game by combining LEGO block[1], and browse web
sites by combining triangle board[2], and control programs
with combined block[3]. However, the goal of these studies
is not to construct ﬂexible musical instruments.
There are systems for producing music composition by
combining blocks that have marker[4][5]. The goal of these
systems is to compose music, while the goal of our study is
to construct musical instruments.
The concept of theUnitKeyboard[6], in our previous work,
is similar to UnitInstrument. We can construct various
types of conﬁgurations on a musical keyboard using the
UnitKeyboard. On the other hand, theUnitkeyboardrealizes
conﬁgurable keyboards, whileUnitInstrument creates new
musical instruments because it combines various types of
musical instruments. This means thatUnitInstrument re-
quires ﬂexible conﬁguration control; therefore we propose a
new language to ﬂexibly deﬁne conﬁgurations of theUnitIn-
strument.

3. DESIGN
UnitInstrument is designed according to the following poli-
cies.
Extracting components from existing instruments
The UnitInstrument enhances the conﬁguration of conven-
tional instruments by connecting the same types of units
as shown in Figure 1. For example, we can construct a
two-octave keyboard by horizontally connecting twoKey-
boardUnits, or construct an organ with dual manuals by
vertically connecting twoKeyboardUnits.
In addition, theUnitInstrument can create new musical
instruments by connecting diﬀerent types of units. For ex-
ample, by connecting theMouthpieceUnit of a wind instru-
ment with theKeyboardUnit, we can construct a new key-
board that easily modulates the velocity and the diapason
of keys being pressed. Additionally, by connecting aFinger-
boardUnitof a guitar to theKeyboardUnit, we can construct
a new keyboard that can easily produce vibrato. In this way,
we can construct new musical instruments that create new
musical expressions, and this concept enhances the possibil-
ity of musical instruments. Note that the use of each unit
is the same as conventional instruments. Therefore, users
can apply the playing techniques and experience they ac-
quired when learning the original instrument to using the
UnitInstrument.

System structure
Flexible and dynamic reconﬁguration
We can construct various types of musical instruments by
connecting multiple units. This means that users need to
conﬁgure various types of settings for each unit. To reduce
the setting time, each unit should recognize its connection
status, and the new settings suitable for the current situ-
ation should be automatically assigned to the unit. Addi-
tionally, there should be a script language to enable ﬂexible
conﬁguration of units. The details of this language is ex-
plained in Section 3.2.
3.1 System structure
Figure 2 shows the system structure of theUnitInstru-
ment. The system consists of units and a Host. Units con-
sist of the followingMuscialUnits andEnhancedUnits.
3.1.1 MusicalUnit
MusicalUnit is a generic term of instrument units, such
as KeyboardUnit, FingerboardUnit,PickupUnit, andMouth-
pieceUnit. AMusicalUnit has at least one functional instru-
mental element: output timing of sound, pitch decision, or
velocity decision.
A MusicalUnit has a wireless module to communicate
with the Host and connectors to connect it to other units.
It sends various operation data to the Host, such as keying,
velocity, pitch, and connection. We explain the design of
the threeMusicalUnits below.
KeyboardUnit
Each key on a conventional keyboard has all functional el-
ements. Additionally, the 12 keyboard keys are intuitively
arranged according to a musical scale, and many pianists
are familiar with normal-sized keys. Therefore, aKeyboar-
dUnit has 12 keys (seven white and ﬁve black) that are
normal size. Additionally, it is equipped with four connec-
tors on the left, right, top, and bottom, for connecting to
other units.
FingerboardUnit
A FingerboardUnit is a unit extracted from the ﬁngerboard
of a conventional guitar. There are four frets on aFin-
gerboardUnit, because we generally play single sounds and
basic chords with four consecutive frets. In addition, the
positions of the frets in aFingerboardUnit are the same as
a conventional guitar because players ofUnitInstruments

PickupUnit
A PickupUnit is a unit extracted from the pickup of a con-
ventional guitar. There are six strings on aPickupUnit be-
cause we generally play melodies and basic chords with six
consecutive strings. In addition, the size of aPickupUnit
is the same as a conventional guitar because of the same
reason ofFingerboardUnit.
3.1.2 EnhancedUnit
An EnhancedUnit is equipped with connectors, sensors
or actuators, and a wireless module, to enhance the func-
tionality of aMusicalUnit. For example, users control the
tone ofMusicalUnits with their posture, which is calculated
and detected from data of the acceleration sensor on the
EnhancedUnit. The acceleration data is then sent to the
Host. At the same time, users can control diapasons of a
MusicalUnit neighboring an EnhancedUnit equipped with
distance sensors. For example, the longer the distance be-
tween theKeyboardUnit and the EnhancedUnit, the higher
the diapason of theKeyboardUnit.
3.1.3 Host
The Host manages the connection status, and controls
the settings of all units. Additionally, it generates a MIDI
messages based on the status of units and data sent from
the units. The settings are managed by mapping between
the physical inputs on the unit and the actual output of
sound. This mapping is described in the script language we
explain in the next section.
3.2 Script language
We assume that players will frequently reconﬁgureUnitIn-
struments, even while they are playing them. Therefore,
each unit should be able to recognize its connection sta-
tus, and the system should automatically and immediately
assign the tone and the diapason to the unit. Addition-
ally, we are able to ﬂexibly assign functional elements to

jects, data
types, operators, and control statements.Unit
and Switch objects also have member variables and func-
tions. The relationship between Unit and Switch objects
is shown in Figure 3. The member variables and functions
of Unit objects are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively,
the member variables ofSwitch objects are listed in Table
3, data types in the script language are listed in Table 4,
operators are listed in Table 5, and the control statements
are listed in Table 6.
To deﬁne the characteristics of units, a user ﬁrst chooses
Unit objects or Switch objects and deﬁnes the type of unit.
Additionally, the tone and diapason of each unit can be
set using control sentences and the member variablestone
and pitch. In addition, units that are connected via each
connector are referred toright and left, and the user can
deﬁne the characteristics of connected units recursively.
3.2.2 Examples of script
A multineck guitar
Figure 4 shows an example script that produces a multineck
guitar structure. The ﬁrst characteristics of thePickupUnit
is deﬁned from lines 4 to 10 and that of theFingerboard-
Unit is deﬁned from lines 11 to 38. Lines 39 to 55 means
that when a right neck (a group ofFingerboardUnits con-
nected to the left side ofPickupUnit) is performed, the sys-
tem outputs sound with the tone of anOverDrive guitar.
On the other hand, lines 56 to 72 deﬁne when the other
neck is performed. The system outputs sound byopening
G tuning, and the tone of the soud is of aclean guitar.
Additionally, do statement recursively sets multipleFinger-
boardUnits. Therefore, the diapason of the necks can be
easily increased.
Instruments that replace pickup with keyboard
Figure 5 shows an example script that produces a keyboard
structure with ﬁngerboard, lines 4 to 14 in this script de-
note that theKeyboardUnitis conﬁgured like a conventional
keyboard. However, lines 45 to 72 denote that a new musi-
cal instrument can be constructed that allocates one string
to one white key in theKeyboardUnit, the pitch from the
connected FingerboardUnits, and the production of sounds
from the pressing of the keys. This can facilitate sweep-
picking, which produces the sounds for sweeping all strings
and the trill picking that alternately outputs the sounds.
4. IMPLEMENTA TION
Figure 6 shows a prototype system including aKeyboard-
Unit, FingerboardUnit, PickupUnit, EnhancedUnitequipped
with an acceleration sensor,EnhancedUnit equipped with a
power supply module, and a Host.
4.1 Host
The Host has a sound module, a wireless module for com-
municating with units. For the prototype, we used a Pana-
sonic CF-Y7 with Windows XP as the Host PC, Microsoft
Visual C++ .NET 2005 for implementing the application to
manage unit settings, Allow7 UM-100 as a wireless module,
and Roland SC-8820 as a MIDI sound generator. In the cur-
rent version of the system, the user conﬁgures the settings
by adding scripts to the source code of the prototype.
4.2 MusicalUnit and EnhancedUnit
We used the UnitKeyboard [6], which we developed , as
the KeyboardUnit. We constructed theFingerboardUnitand
PickupUnit using a YAMAHA EZ-AG electric guitar. Since
it is an electric guitar and has 12 frets in a ﬁngerboard, we

cut it to make the four-fretFingerboardUnits. We used Mi-
crochip Technology PIC16F877A to control theMusicalU-
nits. The software on theMusicalUnits is implemented in
C language on Microchip Technology MPLAB.
A FingerboardUnit has a connector on the right and left
side, a wireless module, a microcontroller, and 24 switches.
Additionally, the connectors have magnets for easily con-
necting/unconnecting another unit. The electrical power
for the FingerboardUnit is supplied by the EnhancedUnit
equipped with a power supply module. The PickupUnit
has a connector on the right, left, top, and bottom, a wire-
less module, strings, six vibration sensors for detecting the
vibration of the strings, and a microcontroller. We also
installed anEnhancedUnit equipped with an acceleration
sensor for detecting the player’s motion.
4.3 Actual use
We used the prototype in several actual performances.
We discuss how eﬀective our proposed device was in these
performances.
Kobe Luminarie Citizens Stage in 2008
We performed using the prototype at the Kobe Luminarie
event on December 13 and 14, 2008. Kobe Luminarie is a
large-scale event held in Kobe, Japan every December. It
began in 1995 and commemorates the Great Hanshin earth-

quake of that year. In this performance, we performed with
two KeyboardUnits, a FingerboardUnit, a PickupUnit, and
an EnhancedUnit equipped with high-intensity light emit-
ting diodes (LEDs). There were two performers; one per-
former played theKeyboardUnit, the other played theFin-
gerboardUnit and the PickupUnit while singing. The Fin-
gerboardUnit and the EnhancedUnit were connected. The
performer playing the guitar played the FingerboardUnit
with his left hand, and performed while waving his left hand
as shown in Figure 7. We showed that theUnitInstruments
were able to be taken apart during the performance.
Tsukamoto Laboratory’s 5th year anniversary party
We played the prototype at the 5th year anniversary party
of Tsukamoto Laboratory on October 30, 2009. We used
twoKeyboardUnits, a FingerboardUnit and a PickupUnit.
There were three performers, and we connected/disconnected
twoKeyboardUnits, as shown in Figure 8. We programmed
tone and diapason assigned to eachKeyboardUnitto change
based on their connection status. Two performers played
theKeyboardUnits. The other played theFingerboardUnit
and thePickupUnit, and he performed and connected/ dis-
connected these units to change the tone and diapason.
Kobe Luminarie citizens stage in 2009
We again performed with the prototype at the Kobe Lu-
minarie event on December 12, 2009. We used a Key-
boardUnit, aFingerboardUnit, and aPickupUnit, and con-
nected/disconnected diﬀerent types ofMusicalUnits. The
tone and diapason of each unit was changed according to
its conﬁguration. There were two performers. First, one
performer played theKeyboardUnit and the other played
the FingerboardUnit and the PickupUnit. In the middle
of performance, the performer playing theFingerboardUnit
and thePickupUnit connected theFingerboardUnitand the
KeyboardUnitafter taking theKeyboardUnitfrom the other
performer, and played the new instrument, as shown in Fig-
ure 9. He easily played sweep-picking to use this instrument.
We showed that we could connect diﬀerent types ofMusi-
calUnits to theUnitInstrument.
5. CONCLUSIONS
We proposed theUnitInstrument, which consists of vari-
ous types of units extracted from conventional instruments
from the viewpoint of functional elements. We can build
various kinds of musical instruments by connecting multi-
ple units.
We intend to design and implement other musical units
such as percussion instruments and wind instruments. Ad-
ditionaly, We will evaluate the hardware characteristics and
usability of our system.
