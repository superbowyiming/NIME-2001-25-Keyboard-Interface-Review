ABSTRACT
This paper provides an overview of the process of editing the
forthcoming anthology “A NIME Reader—Fifteen years of
New Interfaces for Musical Expression.” The selection pro-
cess is presented, and we reﬂect on some of the trends we
have observed in re-discovering the collection of more than
1200 NIME papers published throughout the 15 yearlong
history of the conference. An anthology is necessarily selec-
tive, and ours is no exception. As we present in this paper,
the aim has been to represent the wide range of artistic, sci-
entiﬁc, and technological approaches that characterize the
NIME conference. The anthology also includes critical dis-
course, and through acknowledgment of the strengths and
weaknesses of the NIME community, we propose activities
that could further diversify and strengthen the ﬁeld.

1. INTRODUCTION
Over its 15 years of existence, NIME has become an im-
portant conference series. Each year NIME is the meeting
point of researchers, developers, designers, and artists from
all over the world. Even though participants come from
widely diﬀerent backgrounds, they share a mutual interest
in groundbreaking music and technology.
NIME has grown from a small workshop at CHI in 2001
[11], to a large-scale conference with up to 500 submissions
per year. In fact, more than 1200 papers have been pub-
lished through the conference so far, and, staying true to
the open and inclusive atmosphere of the community, all of
the papers are freely available online.1 The archive is great
if you know what to look for, but it has grown to a size that
is diﬃcult to handle for newcomers to the ﬁeld. Even for
long-timers and occasional visitors, it is diﬃcult to get an
overview of the history and development of the community.

As frequent participants at NIME, but also as co-founder
(Lyons) and current chair of the Steering Committee (Jense-
nius), we are happy to see that a growing number of papers
focus on historical, theoretical and reﬂective studies of the
NIME community itself. We believe this is a healthy next
step for the community to move on to become a ﬁeld in
its own right. As the level of meta-studies started to grow,
we began to see the potential for a collection of articles
to broadly represent the conference series. This thought
has now materialized in the anthology “A NIME Reader—
Fifteen years of New Interfaces for Musical Expression,” to
be published by Springer Verlag in 2016 [8]. This anthology,
which will refer to as Reader in the rest of this paper, con-
sists of 30 selected papers from the conference series, and
with two new commentaries written for each paper.
The Reader is intended for everyone interested in the
ﬁeld, ranging from newcomers who just want to get an
overview of some of the recent advances in music technol-
ogy, including important interfaces, technologies and artis-
tic outcomes, to researchers interested in knowing about
the meta-discussions and reﬂections in the ﬁeld. The selec-
tion of papers reﬂects both the depth and the width of the
publication archive, and the commentaries that follow each
paper have added to the value of the original papers while
at the same time help bring some important underlying dis-
cussions alive throughout the book.
The current paper is oﬀered with several intentions. First
of all we want to share openly with the community the se-
lection process we underwent when choosing the 30 articles
for the book as well as our experience going through the
entire NIME archive as part of this process. We also want
to highlight some of the insights gained as part of the se-
lection, review, and peer commentary processes, some of
which are well known, but some of which took us by sur-
prise. From this we propose some actions that respond to
issues and insights resulting from the editing project. Fi-
nally, we want to encourage others to take up meta-study
and anthology projects of their own in order to “digest” the
(already massive) growing literature of NIME.
2. THE SELECTION PROCESS
By nature, an anthology is a limited selection of chapters,
and for this project we settled on a limit of 30 articles from
the NIME archive. This number was arrived at by estimat-
ing the page count of the resulting volume, and it also ﬁtted
well with the idea of including approximately two published
items for each year of the NIME conference up to and in-
cluding the most recent edition in 2015.
When we set out to create this volume, neither of us
doubted it would be a challenging task. After all, how
does one select 30 papers from more than 1200 items that
have been published in the NIME proceedings, as of 2015?
How could we possibly fairly represent the energetic and
439
creative output in the ﬁeld of musical interface research,
post-NIME? From the outset, the NIME community has
intentionally prioritized a diversity of research styles and
approaches. The conference has also striven to oﬀer an en-
vironment that can attract the participation not only of
researchers working in an academic or institutional con-
text, but also independent artists, researchers and inven-
tors. Moreover, each of us has our own subjective interests
and tastes as to what we consider signiﬁcant prior work.
We started the selection process by each creating an ini-
tial list of 50 or so articles perceived as “inﬂuential” by the
community. This was done by identifying the most-cited
NIME papers in the Google Scholar index. There are other
bibliometric sources, but we found it important to use an
openly available index. Naturally, older papers tend to have
more citations than new ones, so we also considered a mea-
sure of the number of citations-per-year, by dividing the
total citation count by the number of years since publica-
tion. Both measures were used to create our “objective,” or
more accurately “multi-subjective,” initial list of works that
have enjoyed impact.
From this ﬁrst list of well-cited works, which at least to
some extent tells us that other researchers have shown in-
terest in a particular paper, we systematically examined the
content of each one. We each separately created our lists of
papers to include. In many cases, we agreed fully, but for
others discussion, and sometimes multiple discussions, were
needed before we reached agreement. At the same time, we
found that the initial list had gaps in the coverage of some
topics and research approaches. For example, work that is
primarily artistic in nature is usually not as highly cited
as a report on an important technological advance. This
does not imply that artistic research papers are less excel-
lent, important, or inﬂuential on the direction of subsequent
work, but there is just a lower number of active researchers
with a primarily artistic focus. This led each of us to pro-
pose some works that have not been cited as highly as the
others, but which we believe represent some of the diversity
of the NIME corpus. Much discussion was also needed to
reach agreement on which of these were to be included in
the ﬁnal list.
Needless to say, we have not been able to include all of the
papers that we believe deserve a place in a NIME anthology.
The ﬁnal selection reﬂects a compromise to keep within the
limit of just 30 articles. This is also why it is consciously
titled “A NIME Reader” and not “The NIME Reader.” We
hope that there will be other anthology projects drawing on
the extensive NIME proceedings in the future. That is also
why we towards the end of this article suggest projects that
may be of interest for future work.
The ﬁnal selection of papers is presented in Table 1. The
list covers the entire history of the NIME conferences, al-
though we for diﬀerent reasons were not able to include
exactly two papers for each year.
3. PEER-COMMENTARY PROCESS
An important feature of the Reader is the inclusion of not
only articles selected to introduce and represent NIME re-
search, but commentaries on those articles written both by
the authors themselves as well as by other knowledgeable
participants in the NIME community (henceforth “experts”
or“peers.”) Each article is accompanied by one commentary
by one or several of the original authors and one expert com-
mentary. Moreover, authors and peers had a chance to ex-
change feedback on each other’s commentary. The feedback
ranged from simple corrections to enthusiastic discussions of
philosophical issues and resulted in revision of the commen-
tary texts in the majority of cases. We, as editors, took
part in this process both by facilitating and moderating the
exchanges, as well as in providing suggestions and commen-
taries ourselves. We found that the peer-commentary proce-
dure, inspired by Stevan Harnad’s thinking and writing on
the subject [5], really brought our project to life: new ideas
and insights in the peer commentaries and in the exchanges
between authors and experts showed how the selected arti-
cles continue to live, function, and contribute growth in the
research community.
Note however, that the peer-commentary process is not
the same thing as peer-review, that is, the use of single or
double blind peer comments aimed at improving the pa-
pers. All of the included articles have already undergone
a peer-review process in order to be published at NIME,
so we agreed that the papers should not be updated or ex-
panded, except for updating/removing broken URLs and
making formatting adjustments. We also found that carry-
ing out peer-review and selection of the commentaries would
be overkill, as the commentaries were mainly seen as a way
to create discussion and engagement.
Readers may wonder about the conditions of the com-
mentary process: how were the experts selected, and how
was the commentary elicited? As for the selection of ar-
ticles, the choice of commentators was negotiated between
the two editors, through creating and discussing initial lists.
Many, but not all, of the commentators selected were per-
ceived to be frequent“users ”or supporters of a given article,
for having cited it frequently. In other cases, commentators
were selected to increase the inclusiveness (we admit this
is diﬃcult to objectively deﬁne) of the participants in the
anthology, or to involve regular conference participants who
were not otherwise involved in the project. Here again, lim-
itations of the scale of the project meant that we were not
able to involve everyone who came to mind and we recognize
that many who have much to contribute were not included
as commentators. By the same token, some we initially ap-
proached were not able to join as commentators for various
reasons.
4. OBSERVED TRENDS
The lengthy process of selecting articles from the extensive
NIME conference proceedings as well as through organizing
and moderating the peer-commentary activity, aﬀorded an
opportunity to reﬂect on trends that the NIME community
has experienced in the past decade and a half. Some of
these trends are well-established, others are still developing,
while others again are still in their infancy. While detailed
description and discussion of these is beyond the scope of
the current paper, our intention in this section is to outline
some of the major trends we have observed. In the following,
each point is supported by references to articles from the
Reader, as indexed in Table 1.
4.1 Toy to Instrument
The NIME community has greatly beneﬁted from the tremen-
dous progress in human interface technology over the past
two decades. Not surprisingly, many of the articles in the
Reader introduce, or make use of, improved sensor tech-
nologies (e.g. 2002c, 2003b,c; 2004a,c; 2005b, 2006a, 2007a,
2012c). By the same token, interface micro-controllers for
data acquisition and device control have improved in every
aspect and become easier to use, while higher resolution,
faster, and more ﬂexible communication protocols were de-
veloped, standardized, and are now widely in use (e.g. 2003,
2011). Instrument designs have made more eﬀective and
engaging use of the richer, cleaner, high bandwidth data
440
streams available, with more complex motion-to-synthesis
parameter mappings (e.g. 2001b; 2002a; 2003b).
More generally, the approaches to the design of new mu-
sical interfaces have become better informed and employ in-
creasingly sophisticated and theoretically better grounded
design strategies (e.g. 2001a; 2003b; 2004b; 2005a; 2007c,
d; 2012a; 2014). Indeed, we now perceive this to be the
longest and strongest “trend” or thread in the NIME con-
ference and it shows no sign of abating. More strictly formal
approaches to instrument designs have, in recent years, em-
ployed rigorous machine learning techniques (e.g. 2007a).
We acknowledge this as a highly signiﬁcant and growing
trend at NIME, but have chosen consciously not to attempt
to cover this topic fully in the Reader, but to leave it as
an “advanced topic” for more specialized reviews. Simi-
larly, progress in computing hardware and software allows
increasingly powerful approaches to sound synthesis (e.g.
2004d; 2009, 2011).
4.2 Buttons to Embodiment
A key motivation behind human-interface research of the
past two or more decades has been to move away from
the keyboard-mouse-windows concept of HCI towards more
ﬂuid, full-body interaction. NIME is no exception, and in-
deed the rapid expansion and progress in this area was one
of the factors to which the conference owes its existence. Ac-
cordingly, research into motion sensing and music making
continues to form a signiﬁcant thread (e.g. 2003b,c; 2004a;
2005b; 2007a). Even more intimately, new musical inter-
faces have striven to use signals inside the body, through
biosensing technologies (e.g. 2002b; 2012b), or to capture
motion of the whole body (e.g. 2003c; 2006a; 2014).
4.3 Individual to Community, Stage to Street
One emerging trend in NIME research has been the move
from individual performance to interfaces that put the fo-
cus on collaborative creation (e.g. 2003a; 2006a). Likewise,
some researchers have explored technologies and approaches
towards supporting group music-making via laptop orches-
tras (2007b; 2009), web-based performance (2013), and made
the technology development process itself public and collab-
orative via live coding activities (2004d). Another strong
thread is the use of mobile technology to create music any-
where, anytime (2006b). This sub-community of NIME
emerged so strongly that it has also spawned independent
conferences and workshops, a process that has now also be-
gun for the live-coding interest group.
4.4 “Hacking” to “Professionalism”
Early NIME conferences had an aspect of “Woodstock-like”
gatherings of tinkerers, hackers, and makers. However, the
music technology research community has grown and ma-
tured over the years. While a healthy respect for adhoc,
improvised approaches persists, we also see individuals and
groups engage in more long-term and structured develop-
ment work. This work is often focused on development as
process, with an acknowledgment of both formal and infor-
mal evaluation of the interfaces as an important part of this
process. Part of such evaluation can be that of a larger com-
mitment to continued performance with new instruments
(e.g. 2008) in contrast to the early preponderance of “demo
and die” interfaces.
As part of the increased “professionalism” of the ﬁeld, we
are happy to see that new interfaces have often inspired
crowd-funding campaigns, which again have lead to the
funding of successful companies. A prominent example of
successful commercialization is Smule, which oﬀers music-
making apps for mobile platforms. Similarly, well-supported
open source software and hardware projects have ﬂourished
(e.g. 2011, 2012c) and attracted substantial participation.
Introductory courses [4, 6, 9, 12] and outreach activities [1]
have also increased in frequency.
With the increasing maturity of the ﬁeld, we see that
more papers are also devoted to topics outside the “doing”
of NIME, including: pedagogy, history and various types of
reﬂection on the technologies, the artistic outcomes and on
the community itself.
4.5 The NIME Community
The most recent article to be included in the Reader, from
NIME 2015, comes from Adnan Marquez-Borbon and Paul
Stapleton [10]. They oﬀer a critical analysis of the NIME
community, concluding that it more closely resembles a
loosely organized community of interestthan a well-focused
community of practice. Furthermore, they observe that a
lack of a mechanism for judging what can be considered
a “good” NIME performance may inhibit progress in the
ﬁeld. Their commentary to their own article goes further to
suggest that a perceived lack of “coherent vision and critical
reﬂection” may be marginalizing or excluding those who are
not part of the “dominant social norm.”
Critical discussions of the NIME conferences (and com-
munity) have, of course, taken place for many years—in in-
formal discussions among members, in the conference Steer-
ing Committee, and also at the annual “town hall” meetings
at the last day of the conference. However, the appear-
ance of formal critical discourse as an oﬃcial component
of the academic program, such as that of Marquez-Borbon
and Stapleton, marks maturity of the conference and an in-
creasing self-awareness of NIME. Such considerations sug-
gest that it may be time to engage in research into various
aspects of the NIME community.
Many approaches can be envisaged here, from sciento-
metric analyses of the NIME proceedings, such as Jense-
nius’ study of the terminology of gesture [7]. It can also be
interesting to carry out sociological or ethnographic stud-
ies, such as that of Born’s study of IRCAM [2]. Born and
Devine have also recently studied the gender (im)balance
in higher music technology education in Britain [3], a topic
which is also highly relevant for the still male-dominated
NIME community. To start with, however, a modest pro-
posal that arose during the peer commentary process on
the Marquez-Borbon and Stapleton article, is that it would
be valuable to survey the members of the community itself
about their experiences to date and expectations for how
NIME should further develop as a community.
5. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: HOW CAN NIME
CONTINUE TO BE RELEV ANT?
In closing we would like to raise the broader question of the
continuing relevance of the NIME conference. With the ad-
vent of a number of other conferences, festivals, and venues
for presentation of research and artistic practice related to
music technology, we recognize a need for the community
that has emerged around the conference to reﬂect on what
has been accomplished over the past decade and a half, and
to consider how to move forward:
• What aspects of this community’s identity are strongest?
• What shortcomings and imbalances need to be ad-
dressed?
• What interests and viewpoints have been neglected
and how can positive action be taken to cover these?
441
• How can we organize what has been accomplished in
such a form that it is accessible and useful for new
generations of researchers and artists?
• How can we promote the activities of our community
more widely and support long term activities such as
project repositories, development platforms, and en-
trepreneurship?
These are questions for everyone who participates in NIME
and we hope that our anthology project and this article will
encourage everyone to become active in the process of re-
ﬂecting on what has been achieved and contributing to de-
ciding the directions the community will take in the future.
5.1 “Digesting” the past
One way in which to focus the development of the commu-
nity itself is through projects that “digest” past and ongoing
work within the ﬁeld. Our anthology is one example of such
a project. We would like to suggest projects that go beyond
our Reader. For example, it would be interesting to create a
platform that allows ongoing, open (but moderated), peer-
commentary of articles selected into the NIME proceedings.
This would allow dialogue on all works to continue openly
throughout the year, after the intense few days of the annual
conference have ended. Participation could be made volun-
tary, but we can imagine that this would be attractive for
most researchers if it could be made to function smoothly.
Such ongoing dialogue on a project could help with:
• Nurturing ideas: many NIME papers are fairly terse
and have only room to present one (or a few) core
ideas of a larger picture. It would be useful to create
a space in which ideas can be expanded, generating
new insights, suggesting new research directions, and
supporting community-building.
• Discovering pre-existing ideas and works: the NIME
publication archive is already an incredibly rich re-
source for discovering neglected ideas and works, but
augmenting this with peer-commentary would serve to
make the material more transparent and accessible.
• Educating new NIMErs: as a still relatively new com-
munity, with few books and the lack of a long history
or consensus, newcomers to the ﬁeld are often bewil-
dered as to where to start looking for information.
There is clearly a need to develop material that is use-
ful in education but also for researchers in other ﬁelds
visiting the NIME community. Such material could
be a useful spin-oﬀ of an ongoing peer-commentary
platform.
Another idea is to create an active, living repository of
musical interface designs, which allow creators to share code,
hardware speciﬁcations, data, and other material associated
with a given project. This would work towards treating the
“demo and die” syndrome, and serve as a valuable resource
also for composers and performers who would like to lever-
age already developed technology for artistic purposes.
5.2 Anthologies to Come
It is important to stress that even though we have made a
collection now, the aim has never been to create the ultimate
NIME paper selection, or a deﬁnitive “canon” of relevant
work. We would therefore like to provide some concrete
suggestions for others interested in conducting a review or
creating an anthology:
• Anthologies on more specialized topics, for example
on mobile or web technologies, machine learning, or on
the importance of tactility, artistic use, performance
considerations, etc.
• Anthologies based on a particular theoretic thrust,
such as gesture, liveness, community development, ped-
agogy etc.
• Anthologies based on works that have not received
much attention, for example, least cited works, odd
technologies, or comical works?
In conclusion, we hope that our collection will be the ﬁrst
of many. After all, the NIME proceedings archive is a gold
mine of good ideas, and a history of experience and knowl-
edge gained through the dedicated work of many talented
researchers and artists. These should not be forgotten but
rather continue to be used in diﬀerent ways.
