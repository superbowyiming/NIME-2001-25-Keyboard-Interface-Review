Abstract
Active force-feedback holds the potential f or precise and
rapid controls.  A high performance device can be built
from a surplus disk drive and controlled from an ine x -
pensive microcontroller.  Our new design,The Plank has
only one axis of force-feedback with limited range of
motion. It is being use d to explore methods of feeling
and directly manipulating sound waves and spectra sui t -
able for live performance of computer m u sic.
Keywords
Haptics, music controllers, scanned synthesis.
INTRODUCTION
In 1996, Perry Cook at Princeton, Ben Knapp at San
Jose State and Chris Chafe at Stanford University
started teac h ing a video-linked course in human-
computer interaction technology [1].  Max Mathews and
Bill Verplank have in the last two years focussed the
course on music controllers [2] for the masters program
in music science and technology [3].  At CCRMA, we
have a Phantom, a high-performance three-degree-of-
freedom force-feedback device donated by Interval R e -
search. We want a simpler device for experimentation
and performance.

Scanned Synthesis
At Interval, we used Phantoms [4] to explore the value
of force-feedback.  One discovery was that simple
spring-mass simulations, which are uncontrollable wit h -
out force-feedback, can be controlled simply by letting
the vibrating system tr ansfer energy to the human.  In
feeling a simulated wave, Verplank, Shaw and Mathews
had the idea of listening to the shapes.  This came to be
known as "scanned synthesis" [5].  The idea is to d i -
rectly manipulate a dynamic wave shape at human-hand
frequencies  while scanning the wave shape out at audio
frequencies.  The pitch is determined by the length of
the wave and the scan rate.  The timbre is determined by
the wave shape which is being continuously controlled
by the pe r former.
Haptics
The term haptics is used by psychologists to describe
the human sense of touch including skin senses as well
as muscle and joint senses.  Recently, " haptic" devices
have made it to market in vibrating pagers, rumble-
packs, force-feedback joysticks, steering wheels and
mice.  There are active research communities and a small
industry building devices [6].  Standards have been e s -
tablished for communication and development [7].  At
Interval, we explored the potential for simple haptic
devices for media control and expression [8].
HAPTIC ILLUSIONS
The Plank is designed to take advantage of several ill u -
sions that allow us to reduce the device complexity
while maintaining haptic fidelity.  The key feature is a
surface which measures forces orthogonal to its motion.
With a measur ed surface force, the Plank simulates te r -
rain as well as friction and dynamics.

Slope
When you press down on a surface, it usually pushes
back on you with a "surface normal" perpendicular to the
surface. The forces fed back by th e device can give the
illusion of slopes of a surface. Small variations in force
as you move along the surface are felt as bumps.  In a
NIME02-0 2
pioneering study, Margaret Minsky explored this ph e -
nomenon of simulated textures with a two-degree-of-
freedom force-feed back joystick [8].  The Plank, rei n -
forces this illusion by measuring the force applied by
the user normal to the motion and making the tangential
force-feedback pr o portional.

Clutch
Rob Shaw [7] simulated a variety of dynamic  systems
which could be engaged by applying forces.  We came
to call this phenomenon the " haptic clutch".  By pres s -
ing on The Plank, you engage with a simulated moving
object.  This technique compensates for the limited
travel of The Plank and allows the i llusion of wide
reach.

HARDWARE
The construction of The Plank was undertaken as an
educational exercise using inexpensive or found comp o -
nents.  It is described in some detail with the hope that
others will take on  such do-it-yourself  haptics.
Motors
Rotary DC motors are the most common actuators used
for haptic display from $1 vibrators to $100 joysticks to
$10K Phantoms. In contrast, the motors chosen for The
Plank are from computer disk drives where they positio n
the read-heads.  They are known as voice-coil motors.
There is no requirement for gears or pulleys, both the
drive and the sensor are directly coupled to the motor.
Several haptic displays have been made from disk drive
motors.  Hong Tan studied tactil e communication
bandwidth with three independent disk-drive motors
[10].  Pietro Butolo built a planar mechanism for pos i -
tioning the tip of a stylus using three disk-drive motors
[11].  The voice coil motors are readily available as cast-
offs in crashed di sks.
Microcontroller
To ensure rapid computation of the forces, an Atmel
mega163 microcontroller is dedicated to local control of
The Plank.  It operates at up to 8 Mhz with 8 channels
of 10-bit A/D (~10k samples/second), 32 I/0 ports, 16K
bytes of program  memory and 1024 bytes of data me m -
ory.  The microcontroller has a UART for communic a -
tion via MIDI with a synthesizer or real-time DSP sof t -
ware.   Interrupts keep the sampling, or servo update at a
steady rate up to 4kHz.
Sensing and orthogonal force control
A hall-effect sensor is used for rotary position feedback
read by an 10-bit A/D converter built into the microco n -
troller.  A 12-bit DAC commands a power op-amp for
generating up to 3A current and forces up to 5 Newtons
(~1 lb) at the finger tips (for sho rt times).  The sensing
and power amp came from the design for a simple d e -
vice used in teaching haptics [9].  Force-sensitive-
resistors  measure finger pressure on the surface of The
Plank.

EFFECTS
Table of forces: Terrain
The m icroprocessor  holds a small look-up table with a
force for every measured  position of The Plank.  In
scanned synthesis, the shape repr esents one cycle of a
wave or piece of terrain.  As you move The Plank, you
feel the shape of the terrain; when you appl y pressure,
you can m anipulate the terrain .
Figure 7. Forces create terrain illusions.
NIME02-0 3
Motion: Dynamics
The whole terrain can be moved left or right (actually
just a pointer into the table). Buffers can extend the t a -
ble beyond the range of Plank motion ( in the case of
scanned synthesis, the table is circular and the buffers
are not necessary).    To simulate a single mass attached
to a spring, one detent or deep valley in the terrain re p -
resents the position of the mass, its slopes represent the
stiffness of the spring.  The force on The Plank increases
as it moves "up the slope of the valley".  The acceler a -
tion of the mass is simply computed from the force b e -
ing fed back to The Plank.
Friction
We have experimented using the Phantom with several
friction mo dels.  The simplest is "stick-slip".  Just one
spring that builds up to a maximum and then "breaks"
feels like plucking a string.  When one spring breaks
another can grab hold; many small ones make a fine
texture that makes it easy to hold still.  It is ea sy to add
"viscosity" by measuring velocity and resisting the m o -
tion proportionately.
Combinations of these effects should be able to provide
a wide variety of behaviors.  Examples are shown in
Table1.

PROGRESS AND PLANS
The hardware and microprocessor software are  working
in a rough prototype.  We are not yet communicating
with the synthesizer let alone producing music.
The Plank will be used to interface with scanned synth e -
sis, and we will  explore mappings of The Plank's inte r -
acti ons with wave terrains to audio  parameters. An a d -
vantage of haptic  interfaces for real-time music  perfor m -
ance is that the performer  now has a nother direct bid i -
rec tional interaction with the sound through hi s or her
hands. We anticipate being able to simulate the feel of
some traditional musical instr uments (drums, piano,
strings) allowing precise and fast control.  W e are also
looking for new effects and une xpected, expressive
sounds.
