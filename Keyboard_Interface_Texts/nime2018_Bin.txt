ABSTRACT
This paper presents a study examining the eﬀects of disﬂu-
ent design on audience perception of digital musical instru-
ment (DMI) performance. Disﬂuency, deﬁned as a barrier
to eﬀortless cognitive processing, has been shown to gen-
erate better results in some contexts as it engages higher
levels of cognition. We were motivated to determine if dis-
ﬂuent design in a DMI would result in a risk state that
audiences would be able to perceive, and if this would have
any eﬀect on their evaluation of the performance. A DMI
was produced that incorporated a disﬂuent characteristic:
It would turn itself oﬀ if not constantly moved. Six phys-
ically identical instruments were produced, each in one of
three versions: Control (no disﬂuent characteristics), mild
disﬂuency (turned itself oﬀ slowly), and heightened disﬂu-
ency (turned itself oﬀ more quickly). 6 percussionists each
performed on one instrument for a live audience (N=31),
and data was collected in the form of real-time feedback
(via a mobile phone app), and post-hoc surveys. Though
there was little diﬀerence in ratings of enjoyment between
the versions of the instrument, the real-time and qualita-
tive data suggest that disﬂuent behaviour in a DMI may be
a way for audiences to perceive and appreciate performer
skill.

1. INTRODUCTION
Keith Jarrett’s 1975 recording The K ¨oln Concert is a leg-
endary recording of jazz piano performance. The story be-
hind it is often retold: Jarrett, a master of jazz improvisa-
tion, arrived at the concert hall to ﬁnd that an inadequate
piano had been delivered that was broken and out of tune.
The felt had worn away, the pedals didn’t work, the top and
bottom registers weren’t resonant, and it wasn’t big enough
to produce the necessary sound for the concert hall.

Figure 1: Keppi, the instrument used in this study.
After refusing to play he was convinced to play by the
concert organiser. During the concert Jarrett compensated
for the limitations of his instrument in various ways: he
played in the middle of the keyboard, used rolling left-hand
chords, stood up and pounded on the piano to get as much
sound out of it as possible. Instead of the piano’s limita-
tions presenting a barrier to creativity, Jarrett’s real-time
negotiation of these limitations produced an enduring work
of improvisational genius.
This story has been recounted by Tim Harford on the
TED stage [10]. Harford uses the story as an example of
messiness and frustration being gateways to creativity, and
suggests that contending with unexpected problems can in-
spire us to new heights of creativity.
Though barriers are indeed valuable, any person simply
sitting down at a broken piano will not produce such magical
results; it was the combination the limitations and Jarrett’s
skill that pushed his creative power to new heights. We
were motivated, therefore, to determine how a ‘barrier’ —
which in this context we term a disﬂuency, and is deﬁned
below — is negotiated by a DMI performer and perceived
by the audience, to shed some light on this relationship for
DMI designers and practitioners.
This paper details a study that used an instrument called
Keppi (see Figure 1). 6 physically identical versions of
Keppi were produced, each with a degree of disﬂuency (none,
mild, and heightened). Each Keppi was played during a con-
cert by 1 of 6 experienced percussionists and evaluated by
a live audience. We present the results of this study, and
discuss why and how disﬂuency may be useful in DMI prac-
tice.
2. RELATED WORK & MOTIV ATION
2.1 Deﬁning disﬂuency
Disﬂuency is deﬁned in the ﬁeld of cognitive science as ‘the
experience of processing diﬃculty’ [15]. In studies this usu-
ally takes the form of text that is diﬃcult to read because
45
the font is degraded, unfocused, or the letter forms are dif-
ﬁcult to diﬀerentiate. Alter et al. published the results of
a study [1] in which they tested the inﬂuence of text dis-
ﬂuency on the process of mental reasoning, and tested the
results of written tests that were disﬂuent with those that
were not disﬂuent.
The authors found that, perhaps counter-intuitively [6],
disﬂuency produced better test outcomes. They suggest
that this is because disﬂuency demands greater concentra-
tion, thereby triggering heightened cognitive function, and
that ‘experiences of diﬃculty or disﬂuency appear to serve
as an alarm that activates analytic forms of reasoning that
assess and sometimes correct the output of more intuitive
forms of reasoning.’ In other words, disﬂuency forces the
test taker to slow down and consider the problem, instead
of simply relying on their intuition or ﬁrst impressions. The
most useful suggestion here is that it is not a lack of ﬂu-
ency that poses a challenge, but rather too much ﬂuency ;
‘easiness’ may cause us to under-use our mental capacities,
and disﬂuency supplies the friction necessary to prompt the
fuller engagement of cognitive abilities.
This is an interesting argument in relation to DMI per-
formance, which is often exploratory, abstract, and unfolds
on stage in real time. The question, therefore, is whether
disﬂuency can trigger heightened levels of playing in DMI
players, and, most relevant to this research, whether this
would translate into eﬀects perceivable by the audience.
2.2 Disﬂuency vs. appropriation
There is existing literature within NIME on constraint and
appropriation, and it is useful to disambiguate these from
the notions of disﬂuency.
Using constraint in DMI design to encourage personal
playing style has been well explored within NIME [9, 13],
and Zappi and McPherson [17] demonstrated that constraint
is a useful way to take advantage ofappropriating behaviours.
Appropriation, investigated earlier by Dix [7], is the notion
that people will develop ways to use things that the de-
signer neither intended or anticipated. Zappi and McPher-
son found that when performers were presented with instru-
ments that had extremely limited functionality, that play-
ers developed appropriating behaviours in response to con-
straint, and the players found this creatively satisfying.
Constraint and disﬂuency, on the surface, appear to be
analogous. Constraint is like disﬂuency in that it is a limi-
tation, and a performer develops behaviours to contend with
it. However, the salient diﬀerence between constraint and
disﬂuency is their stability over time : An interface will re-
main constrained in the same way, but disﬂuency will dimin-
ish as the disﬂuent element becomes known, and behaviours
to contend with it become second nature.
In this way, if we accept a deﬁnition of improvisation as
‘the realisation of action as it unfolds’ [11, p. 1], then deal-
ing with an unstable disﬂuent quantity through one’s exist-
ing skill and knowledge can be considered a type of improvi-
sation. This further separates disﬂuency from a constraint,
around which a performer can develop a behaviours that
can be practised. Disﬂuency, then, is a continuous state
in which the performer both ascertains the limitation, and
explores, develops and performs their appropriation, in real
time.
2.3 Disﬂuency: A tool for risk?
Disﬂuency occurs when limitations are not entirely known
and the performer must rely on their existing skill; in this
way, it is related to risk. Of course, we don’t go to mu-
sical concerts to watch people mess up or fail, and people
didn’t come to hear Jarrett play because they heard the pi-
ano was terrible and wanted to see what happened. But,
perceivable risk may be a reason why this performance is
legendary: Though the audience did not know the piano
was broken, they saw Jarrett fully engaging his musical and
performative faculties, even groaning and stomping as he
played. This concert’s success might signal that when a
performer is engaging with their own skill, their musician-
ship, understanding, and personal style is fully appreciable.
Fyans et al., in a study examining how audiences under-
stand skill in a DMI performance context [8], found that
spectators reported that the performer ‘failing to engage
with [the DMI] in an embodied way was indicative of a lack
of skill’. This ﬁnding is reinforced by research in cognitive
psychology, most notably Kruger et al.’s ﬁnding that audi-
ences report higher ratings of quality, value and liking on
work that they perceive to require more eﬀort (also known
as ‘the eﬀort heuristic’ [12]). If eﬀort is a marker for quality,
it makes sense that, as Fyans et al. found, that a perceived
lack of eﬀort is associated with a lack of skill. In this way,
disﬂuency may be a useful tool for making skill perceivable.
Yue et al. [16] highlight that not only is the simple pres-
ence of disﬂuency is unlikely to produce great results, but
that not all types of disﬂuency are useful [16]. Bjork and
Bjork, further specify that it is not the simple presence
of disﬂuency that brings about this heightened state, but
rather when disﬂuency that manifests as ‘desirable diﬃcul-
ties’ [4]. The question remains, then, of what a ‘desirable
diﬃculty’ might look like, and how disﬂuency might pro-
duce eﬀects perceivable by the audience.
3. INSTRUMENT DESIGN
For this study we designed a percussion instrument called
Keppi. Keppi is a cylinder 12cm in diameter and 62cm long,
with speakers set in each end. (A round shape was chosen
so it would be handled in three dimensional space and less
likely to be set on a table.) Inside, a Bela [14] handles
all audio and sensor processing. Keppi is played by striking
one of its four electrodes, for example by tapping with hands
and ﬁngers, or tossing and catching. The electrodes detect
hold/release states by capacitive sensing, and networks of
piezo elements under each electrode sense strike velocity,
and Bela plays back a sample in response to the electrode
hit and applies the sensed velocity. Keppi’s sound mimics
a mallet hitting a concrete tube. On the outside of Keppi
there are 5 evenly-spaced rows of white LEDs set into the
surface. Each Keppi weighed about 1kg.
3.1 Disﬂuency in design
All versions of Keppi were identical in size, form factor, in-
teraction, materials and sound, but diﬀering in terms of be-
haviour. The disﬂuent behaviour was this: Keppi turned
itself oﬀ if not moved enough. The disﬂuent behaviour
was added via an on-board accelerometer that continuously
sensed Keppi’s quantity of movement.
The state of a disﬂuent Keppi was visible through the 5
rows of LED lights. If Keppi was not moved enough by
Figure 2: Keppi diagram. Keppi is a cylinder 62cm
long and 12cm in diameter.

Performance DMI behaviour category
Performer A Category 3 (Heightened disﬂuency)
Performer B Category 1 (Control)
Performer C Category 2 (Mild disﬂuency)
Performer D Category 1 (Control)

Performer F Category 2 (Mild disﬂuency)

domly determined.
the performer over time, the rows of lights would turn oﬀ
in succession, like a tick-down timer. When only the last
row was lit the sound would distort, and if all LEDs were oﬀ
Keppi would not make any sound at all. If Keppi was moved
or shaken, the rows of LEDs would light up in succession, a
kind of ‘charge up’ behaviour. This ‘tick-down’ behaviour
was chosen so the state of the instrument would be visible
to the player, and would also be visible to the audience.
There were two categories of disﬂuency: Mild, and height-
ened. This allowed us to test not only whether the mere
presence of disﬂuency had any eﬀect on audience percep-
tion, but also if the degree of disﬂuency had any eﬀect. The
mild disﬂuency instruments turned themselves oﬀ slowly,
with 1600ms between each row of lights turning oﬀ. The
instruments with heightened disﬂuency turned themselves
oﬀ much more quickly, with 800ms between rows of lights
turning oﬀ. The control instruments had no ‘tick-down’ be-
haviour, and the outside lights were illuminated at all times.
6 Keppis were produced, 2 of each of the 3 behaviour cat-
egories. The behaviour categories were as follows:
Category 1: (Control, no disﬂuent charateristic)
Category 2: (Mild disﬂuency)
Category 3: (Heightened disﬂuency)
6 experienced percussionists (5+ years of performing ex-
perience, 4 female and 2 male) were recruited for this study.
Each player was randomly assigned one version of Keppi 2
weeks before the concert, and asked to prepare a perfor-
mance that was three to ﬁve minutes in length.
The players were asked not to discuss the instrument with
their peers, and were not told the details of the study, diﬀer-
ences between instruments, or the kind of instrument they
received. They were given the instrument, shown how it
worked, and invited to compose and perform on it in what-
ever way they felt resonated with their playing style.
4. THE STUDY
The context of the study was an evening concert, in a per-
formance space with raked seating and a level stage. The
study performances were the second act of a three-act con-
cert, which was advertised by email lists and social media.
31 audience members provided complete data sets (meaning
they gave both real-time and post-hoc feedback).
4.1 Data gathering
Data was gathered using a methodology for audience study [3]
that combines both post-hoc and real-time data. Real time
data was used to identify moments of interest in the video
footage.
After the ﬁrst act the study was introduced and the au-
dience was invited to participate. Data gathering was ex-
plained, and survey books were distributed 1. There were

mance. Error bars indicate SD.
7 surveys: 6 post-performance surveys, and 1 post-concert
survey.
Real-time data was collected via Metrix (a system de-
signed for this purpose) [3], and at this point the onboard-
ing video for Metrix was screened. The Metrix interface
(see Figure 5) had two buttons that allowed audiences to
indicate two states: ‘I am enjoying this’ and ‘I saw an er-
ror’. (See [3] for a full discussion of this interface and study
methodology.)
4.2 Study method
The audience (N=31) watched all six performances. The
order of performers (detailed in Table 1) was randomly as-
signed. The performers stayed outside until their time to
play, to avoid inﬂuencing by other players. Before they be-
gan they were introduced to the audience with their name.
Audience members ﬁlled out a post-performance survey af-
ter each performer, and completed the post-concert survey
at the end.
5. RESULTS
5.1 Post-hoc results: Quantitative
The quantitative data reported here is composed of the rat-
ings of Enjoyment for each of the six performances (collected
via the post-performance surveys). Enjoyment ratings were
on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much).
First, the Enjoyment ratings for all six performances were
considered (illustrated in Figure 3). A Friedman (paired,
non-parametric) test was used to determine if there were
diﬀerences in ratings of Enjoyment across the six perfor-
mances, and compared the mean Enjoyment rating of each
performance to the mean enjoyment rating of all others.
Dunn’s correction was used for multiple comparisons. There
were statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the 6 per-

category. Error bars indicate SD.

formances (χ2(5) = 52.31, p <.0001).
Post hoc analysis showed statistically signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences in ratings of Enjoyment between the following perfor-
mances (signiﬁcance threshold p <.05):
Perf. D (mean 4.455) rated signiﬁcantly higher than the
following: Perf. A (mean 3.576, p=.002), Perf. B
(mean 3.788, p=.033) and Perf. C (mean 3.152, p<.0001)
Perf. E (mean 4.03) rated signiﬁcantly higher than Perf.
C (mean 3.152, p=.0034)
Perf. F (mean 4.333) rated signiﬁcantly higher than Perf.
A (mean 3.576, p=.0169) and Perf. C (mean 3.152,
p<.0001)
Second, ratings of Enjoyment were analysed by instru-
ment category (mean ratings by category are illustrated
in Figure 4). A Kruskal-Wallis (unpaired, non-parametric)
test was used to determine statistically signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences in the Enjoyment rating between the three instru-
ment categories. Dunn’s correction was used for multiple
comparisons. No statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
categories were found.
5.2 Post-hoc results: Qualitative
The qualitative data corpus was composed of the responses
to the questions in each post-performance survey: ‘What
did you like about the performance?’ and ‘What did you
dislike about the performance?’. Thematic analysis was
performed on this data corpus using an inductive method.
First, the data was coded, resulting in 54 codes, which were
then grouped into themes. Five themes emerged: Ways of
Playing, Instrument, Sound, and Experience Descriptors,
and Performer Skill.
5.2.1 Skill-related comments
Mentions of skill were present in the ‘like’ responses of all
performances, but were particularly prevalent for Perfor-
mances A, D, E and F. Mentions of skill were present for
the ‘dislike’ responses only of Performance C.
5.2.2 Differences between instrument conditions
The qualitative data themes were compared between the in-
strument test conditions. Though all three instrument con-
ditions had responses related to the theme of Way of Play-
ing for the ‘enjoyment’ question, the Category 1 (control)
instruments did not have mentions related to physicality.
Category 2 (mild) and 3 (heightened) responses mentioned
physicality.
5.3 Real-time results
Real-time data was collected using Metrix. Due to the high
incidence of ‘Enjoyment’ tap events, these are grouped into
5s time bins, and ‘Error’ events into 1s bins. For each par-
ticipant, any more than 1 tap per time bin were discarded.
The real-time data was visualised to give an overall sense
of audience reaction during the performances (see Figure 6
Figure 6: Visualisation of Metrix data for Perf. D.
Top: Enjoyment button. Bottom: Error button.
for an example). ‘Enjoyment’ events tended to accumulate
over time, whereas ‘error’ events had a sudden onset and
dropoﬀ.
5.3.1 Real-time data and the video footage
All performances were recorded on video. The real-time
data was synchronised with the video footage via an audible
click made at the time Metrix was made active.
The real-time data was used to examine the video for
indications of moments of audience agreement about ‘en-
joyment’ and ‘error’. This was done by determining times
of audience agreement in one or more time bins (called
‘events’), and coding the video at these times. Events were
determined using the following criteria:
Enjoyment events: An event started when 6 or more
audience members indicated ‘enjoyment’ in a particular 5s
time bin. The event starts from this bin and ends on the
next bin where the number of audience agreements is less
than 6, or is 5 less than the start value.
Error events:The threshold of audience agreement in a
1s time bin was 2, or 3 agreements over 4 consecutive time
bins. The event starts from the ﬁrst bin and ends when
there have no error events for 2s.
The ‘enjoyment’ and ‘error’ events were then visualised
on the video footage to facilitate coding (see Figure 7).
Figure 7: Video still with events from real-time data
indicated (pictured are the third ‘enjoyment’ event
and fourth ‘error’ event).
48
The video was coded at times of ‘enjoyment’ and ‘error’
events, and after coding, the codes were grouped together
into themes. Coding of ‘enjoyment’ and ‘error’ events was
done separately, as there is no relationship intended between
the two terms, and audiences have been found to treat the
terms as independent and not as binary opposites [3].
5.3.2 Themes of ‘enjoyment’ events
The codes generated from the video documentation at the
times of ‘enjoyment’ events clustered around the following
themes:
1. Novelty: Change of motif, new elements
2. Pattern: Rhythm, repetition, returning to motif.
3. Player action:Actions that display intention, or dis-
play technique/skill.
4. Time-based features:Establishing themes, moments
of ﬂow/build-up.
The highest-rated performances (Performance D, E and
F) all included ‘enjoyment’ events related to player action,
and speciﬁcally to skill, such as fast or complex rhythms.
The lowest-rated performance, Performance C, had ‘en-
joyment’ events clustered around time-based features such
as the establishment of rhythm, but had only 3 ‘enjoy-
ment’ events overall. Performances A and B had enjoyment
events that mostly featured change, such as a new element
or method of interaction.
5.3.3 Themes of ‘error’ events
The codes from the ‘error’ events were clustered around the
following themes:
1. Inference of performer action:Moments of hesita-
tion, performer seems unsure, unclear intention
2. Interrupted expectations:Breaks in rhythm, changes,
unexpected elements, sound distortion
3. Technical errors:The performer adjusting the instru-
ment, gestures that do not make sound, moments of
struggle with the instrument.
‘Error’ events tended to be predominantly related to themes
of interruption, such as moments where the rhythm was in-
consistent. The theme of performer action was also salient,
and moments where performers were unsure, or hesitated,
tended to be marked as errors. Technical errors such as the
instrument not sounding or the performer not being con-
ﬁdent and ﬂuent in their handling of the instrument also
tended to be considered errors.
Though all instrument types had ‘error’ events related
to rhythm inconsistencies and technical errors, the perfor-
mances using Category 1 (control) instruments (Performances
B and D) had ‘error’ events related to judgement of per-
former action, such as hesitation and intention.
6. DISCUSSION
6.1 A design feature isn’t enough
The quantitative data, composed of the ratings of Enjoy-
ment for each performance, showed that some individual
performances were rated signiﬁcantly higher, but there was
no clear preference for disﬂuent instruments. When the rat-
ings were compared by instrument category, they were not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. The two performances with the high-
est mean ratings, Performance D and Performance F, were
Category 1 (control) and Category 2 (mild disﬂuency) in-
struments, so the presence of disﬂuency did not appear to
positively aﬀect post-hoc audience ratings of Enjoyment.
This is consistent with previous work has that found that
the instrument itself has little eﬀect on audience perception
of DMI performance [2], and reinforces the suggestion that
simply making design disﬂuent is not always useful [16].
6.2 Audience perception of skill
This lack of signiﬁcant preference for any instrument sug-
gests that the degree of visible risk may not be very im-
portant to audiences, or rather, that audiences don’t hold
visible risk as a priority. The qualitative data, however,
showed that audiences were sensitive to the performer’sskill
for the disﬂuent instruments. For Performances A, E, and F
skill was mentioned in a positive sense. For Performance C
— the performance that, in the qualitative data, was rated
signiﬁcantly lower rated than most others — skill-related
dislikes were present.
Though the audience being able to perceive disﬂuency
and the risk that comes with it does not seem to be nec-
essary, this study audience was remarkably sensitive to the
presence of skill. They recognised and commented upon
the skill in all of the performances using disﬂuent instru-
ments. This supports Fyans and Gurevich’s deﬁnition of
skill [8] as an embodied phenomenon, and a combination of
control and eﬀort, and suggests that disﬂuency may be a
way of making control and eﬀort visible and appreciable by
audiences.
Performer C played a Category 2 instrument (mildly dis-
ﬂuent), and was the lowest-rated performance. The audi-
ence noticed his lack of eﬀort, and that they were inexpert
in handling the instrument. In the video documentation the
audience indicated many ‘error’ events, and in review of the
video they are noticeably less ﬂuent with it, holding it in
one hand and playing with the other, not employing any
of the creative physical playing methods employed by the
other performers.
In this case, it may be that disﬂuency has had a deteri-
mental eﬀect, and rather than being what Bjork and Bjork
would call a desirable diﬃculty [4] — one that matched and
challenged their ability and style, and that they could lever-
age their skill to contend with — it was simply a diﬃculty,
and this was perceived by the audience as a deﬁcit of skill.
For the other 5 performers, their skill and their instru-
ment’s behaviour happened to be better-matched. The fact
that one performer did not cope well with disﬂuency does
suggest that the mere presence of disﬂuency is not a creative
panacea: it has to be the right kind of disﬂuency, matched
to the right level of skill. This also aligns with Cskiszent-
mihaly’s work on ﬂow, his central tenet being that, in order
to reach a ‘ﬂow state’, skill and challenge must be in bal-
ance [5].
These results further suggest that though Jarrett’s per-
formance choices in the K¨oln Concert may have been inﬂu-
enced by the disﬂuent piano, the success of this piece may
be instead because this presented an opportunity for the
audience to appreciate his masterful level of skill.
6.3 Disﬂuency: Effects on performance out-
comes
Though this study focuses on audience perception and not
the performer, the performers’ choices around the instru-
ment are notable.
These six performances displayed a huge diversity of play-
ing methods:
Performer A (heightened): created complex counter-
rhythms by stomping their feet while playing
Performer B (control): struck Keppi with their hands
and bare feet
Performer C (mild):incorporated a shaking motion
49
Performer D (control): balanced Keppi between two
chairs, played with ﬁngers like a piano
Performer E (heightened):played seated and kept Keppi
moving by bouncing it against their bare knee, creating a
rhythmic drone
Performer F (mild):incorporated a swinging motion
It is possible (though by no means certain) that disﬂuency
played a role in this diversity. Contrasting the control per-
formances with the performances on disﬂuent instruments,
there were a number of strategies that may not have been
employed were it not for the requirement to keep the instru-
ment moving (such as the knee-bouncing in Performance E,
or the swinging of the instrument in Performance F). Per-
formances A, E and F, all with disﬂuent instruments, in-
corporated the tick-down movement of the lights into the
performance.
An informal survey after the study asked the performers
what they liked about the instrument, and all respondents
who had a version with disﬂuent behaviour cited this as a
positive aspect:
Performer A (heightened):‘I liked that I had to be ac-
tive to make it work.’
Performer C (mild):‘The necessary movement leads to
movement in rhythm.’
Performer E (heightened): ‘I did like the aspect of it
having heft, and needing to be explored. I enjoyed that it
took some eﬀort to play and come to grips with.’
Performer F (mild): ‘I liked the limitation set on it
where it had to be constantly moved. I’ve always found
that limitations result in increased creativity on the per-
former’s part.’
This feedback adds another layer of depth to the ﬁnding
that audiences appreciate eﬀort and control: while we can-
not determine whether these 4 performers view the disﬂuent
behaviour of Keppi as an obstacle to overcome or a charac-
teristic to be learned, the response shows that performers
also positively engage with challenges that require them to
leverage their existing skill.
6.4 Implications for DMI designers
Though the audience did not respond speciﬁcally to the in-
strument’s disﬂuency creating risk, a disﬂuent instrument
did tend to gather more comments about performer skill.
The implication for DMI designers, then, is that instru-
ments that oﬀer the opportunity for displaying eﬀort and
control would be useful for audiences. Fyans et al.’s sug-
gestion of skill being a combination of control and eﬀort [8]
was reﬂected in this study, as the video coding showed that
moments of ﬂow or physical engagement were particularly
enjoyed by the audience.
7. CONCLUSION
This paper details a study of the eﬀects of disﬂuent design
on audience perception of DMI performance. One instru-
ment was designed, and six were produced in three versions:
no disﬂuency, mild disﬂuency, and heightened disﬂuency.
Six experienced percussionists composed on one of these in-
struments, then performed for a live audience (N=31). Data
was collected in the form of post-hoc surveys and real-time
feedback. The results suggest that, at least with a small
sample, simply incorporating disﬂuency into DMI design
does not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the audience’s reported
enjoyment, but does allow the audience to recognise per-
former skill. The implication for DMI designers is that,
although a disﬂuent characteristic does not automatically
heighten audience enjoyment, understanding how a DMI
can allow the performer to display eﬀort and control can
contribute to audience appreciation of performer skill.
