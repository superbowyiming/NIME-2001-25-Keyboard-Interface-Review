ABSTRACT
This paper discusses Pandora's Box, a novel idiosyncratic electroacoustic instrument 
and performance utilizing feedback as sound generation principle. The instrument's 
signal path consists of a closed-loop through custom DSP algorithms and a spring. 
Pandora's Box is played by tactile interaction with the spring and a control panel with 
faders and switches. The design and implementation are described and rituals are 
explained referencing a video recording of a concert.

Introduction
“The Larsen effect happens when—given sufficient amplification—the sound captured 
from a microphone connected to a speaker is reproduced and again captured, 
recursively, resulting in a positive feedback that produces pitched tones from the 
iterated amplification of a signal.” [1]
Feedback in music
Different approaches to the use of feedback within music have been explored since the 
1960s. Well-known examples are John Cage (Electronic Music for Piano, 1964), Steve 
Reich (Pendulum Music, 1968), and Jimi Hendrix. [2]
Halldór Úlfarsson's Halldorophone utilizes multiple feedback paths in a ‘‘cello-like 
drone instrument’’ and can be categorized as an augmented instrument as many 
playing methods from existing string instruments are inherited but new playing 
techniques are added. [3]
Toshimaru Nakamura improvises with no-input mixing boards utilizing feedback with 
electronics. A mixer and some audio effects are connected together creating a closed 
signal path where sound originates from the artifacts of the system's components. [4]  
In this nondeterministic system small changes in parameters can result in widely

different sounds. Pandora's Box, however, is a system with determined interaction and 
thus performing can be learned.
Pandora's Box
Pandora's Box is an idiosyncratic 
single-purpose instrument and has 
been designed with a single concert 
in mind. The concept of the 
instrument has been derived from 
an earlier instrument called 
Springlevend. [5]
The feedback loop through the 
instrument is affected both by 
physics and DSP. Vibrations from 
the spring are picked up by a piezo 
microphone and analyzed by an 
algorithm controlling an oscillator. 
The oscillator is output via a 
speaker setting the spring in motion. With direct control over parameters like the 
oscillator range and delay time the seemingly unstable feedback can be guided to 
specific frequencies and sounds. The instrument is played by physically interacting 
with the spring, manipulating the toggles controlling signal flow and the faders 
mapped to parameters of the algorithm.
A secondary signal is derived from the algorithm’s output, processed with a custom 
pitch shifting algorithm and spatialized with an octophonic speaker setup. This signal 
adds contrasting texture to the very local and aggressive sound of the feedback 
through the spring.
Methodology
Springlevend, a previous iteration of Pandora’s Box, consisted of a spring glued to a 
speaker, a piezo microphone on a clothespin, a bass fuzz pedal and an amplifier. [5] 
Performing with this instrument led me to several conclusions:

I found the physical interaction with feedback through the spring fun to perform 
with and received positive reactions about the visibility of interaction with sound.

These conclusions led to the creation of Pandora's Box. The core DSP algorithm 
replacing the guitar pedal was inspired by a paper about the usage of Phase-Locked 
Loops for pitch tracking. [6]
Signal path
The signal path is based on a 
continuous cycle of sound being 
transformed physically and with DSP 
and fed back into the start of the signal 
path again (Figure 2). Physically the 
sound is transformed by the 
characteristics of the speaker, the 
spring and the piezo.
The PLL algorithm
The PLL algorithm (Figure 3) tracks the 
pitch of the incoming signal by counting 
the time in between zero crossings and 
uses this to control a sine wave 
oscillator. The envelope follower is used 
as a threshold to ignore zero-crossings 
while the audio signal is not loud 
enough. If a zero crossing is detected, 
the time since the last zero-crossing is 
counted and the oscillator frequency is 
adjusted. The range parameter sets the 
maximum frequency of the oscillator: the counted frequency is compared against the 
range and is lowered by an octave until it no longer exceeds the range.
White noise can also be added into the feedback loop (Figure 2) which, due to its high 
density of zero crossings, will make the PLL oscillator output a noise-like signal. 
I found the mix of two contrasting signals in the feedback path, one with a strong 
low end and one with a very distorted noisy high end, capable of creating interesting 
sounds.
Hauling around a lot of gear and cables to be able to perform with Springlevend was 
cumbersome. The instrument could be improved by making it self-contained.

Constraining this ‘frequency’ with the range slider allows the performer to play a 
relatively stable pitch. (4:55 - 5:00) [7]
Delay
The signal is fed into a delay line with a delay time ranging 
from 5 samples up to a maximum of 3 seconds. The delay time 
is controlled by a fader and changes in value are smoothed with 
a rise time of 453 ms and a fall time of 113 ms resulting in pitch 
sweeps. [8]
The buffer overtone algorithm
The purpose of the 
buffer overtone 
algorithm (Figure 4) 
is to add a 
contrasting layer to 
the distorted sounds 
circulating in the 
closed feedback loop. 
The overtone 
algorithm processes 
the signal tapped from the feedback loop 
and sends it to DAC2. During the concert [7] 
DAC2 was connected to a computer running 
a Max/MSP patch spatializing the signal 
over 8 channels by randomly changing the 
gains of each speaker. The overtone 
algorithm which is derived from time-
domain pitch-shifting [9] generates 5 overtones of the PLL signal (Figure 5).
The spread parameter determines the pitch shift of the 5 overtones and allows 
morphing from a pitch shift to every harmonic to a pitch shift every uneven harmonic 
(Figure 6). Each individual overtone is gated by its own toggle and multiplied by the 
PLL envelope.

Post processing
At different points in the signal path filters and tanh distortion is used to shape and 
constrain the signal. Audio sent to the outputs is filtered to remove DC offsets and to 
compensate for the harsh frequency response of the speaker.
Hardware
Due to portability requirements all electronics are mounted within the speaker 
cabinet. All DSP is done on a Bela in C++ allowing for a feedback loop of half a 
millisecond. [10]
The instrument's appearance mirrors its sounds: a mix between polished and rough. 
The reused speaker cabinet is spray-painted black and the wooden frame is painted 
gold which has been sanded off partially (Figure 7). 
The top side of the instrument has on its left side the speaker with the spring and on 
the right side the control panel (Figure 8). The side facing the performer has 5 toggles

to gate the individual overtones (Figure 7).
The output gain fader can be used to 
quickly increase or decrease the 
feedback intensity. A horizontally 
mounted 100mm fader slides smoothly 
and allows for expressive movements. 
The switches on the top panel have 
little resistance but still feel firm and 
can be used to play gating rhythms.
The piezo can be used to pick up sounds 
from the spring or can also be excited 
by touching it or rubbing it on the 
wooden frame. I find myself mostly 
playing with the piezo mounted at the 
end of the spring: sound travels from 
the speaker to the piezo microphone 
through the spring and the feedback 
loop is closed.
Pandora’s Box as performance
Performances played with Pandora’s Box are improvised but follow two principles.
Conclusions
Evaluating and reiterating upon a previous instrument led to an idiosyncratic 
instrument and performance called Pandora's Box. This new iteration is self-contained, 
portable and the new DSP section in the signal path is found to be capable of creating 
a wide range of sounds without relying on a high number of parameters.

Metaphorically Pandora’s Box opens halfway through the performance. At this point 
I open the overtone output gate (Figure 8). Then sound is not constrained by the 
built-in speaker anymore and is spatialized in the surrounding space. (5:30) [7]
I wear a three-piece suit on stage. To signify the start of the performance I take of 
my jacket and put it on the coat hanger on the side of the instrument. Near the end 
of the performance (10:59) I put on my jacket again, signifying the end. [7]
