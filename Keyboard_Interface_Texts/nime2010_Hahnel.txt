ABSTRACT
The propriety of articulation, especially of notes that lack
annotations, is inﬂuenced by the origin of the particular
music. This paper presents a rule system for articulation
derivedfromlateBaroqueandearlyClassictreatisesonper-
formance. Expressive articulation, in this respect, is under-
stood as a combination of alterable tone features like dura-
tion, loudness, and timbre. The model diﬀerentiates global
characteristics and local particularities, provides a general
framework for human-like music performances, and, there-
fore, serves as a basis for further and more complex rule
systems.

1. INTRODUCTION
For so called historically informed performance (HIP) it is
to know what annotations mean in particular, but, above
all, hownon-annotated notes are performed. Baroque trea-
tises on music performance include many rules of expres-
sion. BookswrittenbyLeopoldMozart[13], JohannQuantz
[14], CarlP.E.Bach[2], andcontemporariesserveasagreat
source for musicians who are devoted to HIP.
Now, the question is: Do these Baroque sources include
suﬃcient rules for a synthetic expressive performance sys-
tem, or, in other words, is it possible to derive an ade-
quate expressive Baroque articulation out of rules taken
from historical treatises? An answer is important in many
respects: The main articulations that are used today refer
toBaroqueannotations. Knowledgeabouthistoricalperfor-
mance styles and their diversity will give an insight into the
evolution of performances. Since HIP asks what we really
know about ancient performance styles, performance anal-
ysis always has to separate strict rule playing and creative
personal enrichment.
One way to “soniﬁcate” performance theory objectively
is to simulate expressive performances. With progress in
human-like performance simulation powerful tools are now
available, the parameters of which “only” have to be tuned
right. This paper collates German late Baroque treatises

to expound a model for the expressive articulation of non-
annotated notes. Section 2 motivates this work from a his-
torical point of view. How musical structure inﬂuences du-
ration, loudness, and timbre of a tone is demonstrated in
Section 3. There an overview of general and basic rules
is further complemented by speciﬁcations given in Tables.
Section 4 attends to musical characters and directions, fol-
lowed by a general discussion in Section 5.
2. BACKGROUND
The more we are informed about Baroque music the better
we apprehend Classic [4]. Moreover, our understanding of
what music is and how, where, and in which context com-
posed music is performed and also perceived was mainly
deﬁned in the Baroque era: In the 17th and 18th century
social changes led to new musical achievements like the pub-
lic and private concert, chamber music and dilettantes. To-
day’s major/minor tonality took shape at that time, not
to mention musical forms like the sonata and symphony
Baroque music pioneered.
Apart from timing, dynamics (loudness) and timbre, re-
search on expressive performance focused on articulation
but merely as a duration feature [3, 9, 12]. With regard to
accents and the variety of playing techniques, investigations
into articulation should rather concern the whole shape of a
tone. This would conform with the behaviour of human mu-
sicians who cause changes in duration, loudness, envelope,
timbre, and probably pitch by varying articulation [6].
Composers inserted annotations only if the articulation
they intended diﬀered from a clear common knowledge or
practice. Fortunately, composers, musicians, and musicolo-
gists wrote down these rules, which was motivated by the
demand of educated laymen who appeared at this time.
3. ARTICULATION FEATURES
By articulation, the note (a musical symbol) becomes a tone
(the physical counterpart of the note). One problem, in this
respect, istheinﬂuenceofmusicalstructureontonefeatures
like duration, loudness, and timbre. This Section compares

Baroque and early Classic.1
Articulation features are often fused. Additionally, rules
refer to either global articulation characteristics or local
particularities. The former refer to the whole movement,
whereas the latter deal with deviations caused by distinct
structural phenomenons.

T
able 1: Inﬂuences on tone duration.
The duration of a tone is the time between its onset and its
oﬀset. The standard (global) duration depends on tempo
and note length. Long notes should be played legato [1],
especially in slow movements [15, 2]. Midtempo notes (nor-
mally eighths) in the accompaniment have to be played
short [2, 13, 15, 17], especially in fast movements [14]. The
fastest notes are playedstaccato [14].
Apart from these general instructions, there are addi-
tional rules as shown in Table 1. Because the performer
must further separate musical ideas, the last tone of every
idea has to get shorter and, therefore, never be alegato.

T
able 2: Local inﬂuences on loudness.
The loudness dimension of Türk [17] and others is the di-
mension of strength. Reichardt [15] generally relativized
the intensity of Quantz’ accents, but backed the system it-
self [14]. Certainly, one reason for this is the instrument
that every author focused on, for the same loudness change
on a ﬂute (Quantz’ instrument) needs a stronger accentu-
ation than a violin [15]. Table 2 summarizes rules of local
inﬂuences on loudness.
Rules concerning the loudness progression within long
tones are both local and global. Long tones usually start
quiet with an increase of loudness, which, at the center of
the tone, turns into a decrescendo until the end [1, 13, 14].
Accentuated long tones already start loud. Table 3 lists the
referring rules of loudness progression.
3.3 Timbre
The physics of overtones and their combinations have been
described since the 19th century, most notably started with
Helmholtz [5]. Thus, it is hardly surprising that treatises of
the 18th century rarely deal with this. Nonetheless, they do

deal with the quality of sound. All authors preferred a clean
sound that mimics a singing voice. This is not very infor-
mative, for we do not know when a sound was perceived as
clean enough. Some original gut string sounds may not be
received as very clean with today’s demands. More mean-
ingful instructions refer to sound changes: In Mozart’s book
on violin playing [13] a single-tone crescendo is achieved by
a stronger bow pressure instead of an increased speed of
the bow stroke. This it at least one indication for a sound
inﬂuence.
Reichardt [15] wrote in a sentence about the andante:
The bow must have the lightness of the allegro bow without
its sharpness. The upbow can play two fast notes shortly
detached (i.e.,staccato).2

sharpness of a tone had been tolerated remains speculative.
It is also an individual decision of the musician.

3.4 Summary
Figure 1 simpliﬁes the expressive articulation model de-
scribed in this Section. The principal ﬁnding is easy: The
fasterthetempoandtheshorterthenotelength, theshorter
the duration proportionally to the note length. Further-
more, with an increased tempo a less clean sound is sup-
posed. In an adagio the standard articulation islegato. For
the andante thelegato is just used for long notes. Fast notes
in the andante are played slightly accentuated. Deﬁnitely
that is the proper articulation of medium notes in an allegro
and so on. The Baroqueprestissimo is not faster than an
