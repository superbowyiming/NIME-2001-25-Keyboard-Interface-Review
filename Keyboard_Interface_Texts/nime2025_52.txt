Abstract
This paper introduces LIMITER, a gamified digital musical in-
strument for harnessing and performing microtonal and justly
intonated sounds. While microtonality in Western music remains
a niche and esoteric system that can be difficult both to concep-
tualize and to perform with, LIMITER presents a novel, easy to
pickup interface that utilizes color, geometric transformations,
and game-like controls to create a simpler inlet into utilizing these
sounds as a means of expression. We report on the background
of the development of LIMITER, as well as explain the under-
lying musical and engineering systems that enable its function.
Additionally, we offer a discussion and preliminary evaluation of
the creativity-enhancing effects of the interface.

1 Introduction
Play is a fundamental element of human experience, and has been
shown to have highly positive effects on development, mental
health, and creativity [8]. LIMITER is motivated, then, by a desire
to incorporate game-like elements into a musical interface in
order to capture the positive effects of play, particularly those on
creativity, into music performance and composition.
Although microtonal and justly intonated music remain out-
side the realm of idiomatic and conventional Western popular
music, with a few exceptions1, we believe that harnessing these
techniques offers the opportunity to discover new sounds and
give audiences and performers new types of musical experiences.
The primary problem with justly intonated music is that, while
vocalists and non-fretted instrument performers often do it intu-
itively, asking musicians to perform specific, custom microtonal
gestures with shifting tuning systems is a difficult feat that re-
quires a large amount of training and rehearsal, and is largely
restricted to experimental usage2. The advent of digital musical
instruments (DMIs) in the second half of the twentieth century
perhaps offers a solution to this problem, but many of these new
interfaces face the fundamental limitation of lacking embodi-
ment, with the literal sound-making device and the controller
being separated and only abstractly connected, thus spurring
the criticism of uninterpretability and unemotiveness from an
audience’s perspective [23].

LIMITER overcomes this problem by allowing the user to com-
bine the experience of playing an 80s arcade machine with full
justly intonated expression, offering the ability to swap tuning
systems on the fly and play complexly tuned chords, but packaged
in an interface that feels familiar and intuitive. With LIMITER,
the musician uses the simple controls of a button and joystick to
create these chords and communicate them with color and phys-
ical input in a way that abstracts the mathematical operations,
but remains clear and highly expressive both to an audience and
a performer. It offers a novel system of visual composition that
allows amateurs and experienced musicians alike the ability to
control these microtonal chords, thus synthesizing a gamified
musical interface and a conduit for clearly visualizing alternate
tuning systems into one creativity-enhancing system 3.
2 Background
LIMITER’s uniqueness stems from its combination of both mi-
crotonal sound synthesis and a gamified interface with a visual,
color-based system of performance and composition. While each
of these have some precedent in isolation, this novel combination

is what allows for LIMITER’s ease of use and depth of expression.
The remainder of this section is devoted to a brief discussion of
prior NIMEs that are relevant to each of LIMITER’s subsystems.
2.1 Microtonal & Justly Intonated NIMEs
Numerous acoustic musical instruments from various cultures
and time periods offer the potential for microtonal expression,
ranging from non-fretted string instruments like the violin to
the voice to the bağlama from Turkey and Greece [ 22]. Many
digital musical instruments, however, have coalesced around
using twelve tone equal temperament (12TET) due to the simple
fact that the now ubiquitous MIDI standard bakes this system
in to its protocol (although it is important to note that MIDI 2.0
does enable the use of some limited microtonal pitch bends) [9].
Despite this, over the course of NIME’s proceedings from
2001 to the present there have been a number of papers that
presented interfaces for microtonal or justly intonated expression.
In one [18], the performer uses gestures and the excitation of
various physical surfaces to control microtonal sound. Another
system [10] presented a physical interface for manipulating a
harmonic tuning lattice in a way that bares some similarity to
LIMITER’s sound synthesis technique. Other systems focus on
bringing the possibility of microtonal gestures and expression to
woodwind instruments, with one [3] focusing on breath control
and another highlighting the potential for making 3D printable
microtonally tuned flutes [17]. These instruments, despite their
innovations, however, are generally either more fixed in the
specific microtonal sounds they can create or remain difficult to
understand from an audience perspective.
2.2 Gamified Music and Compositions
One of the core characteristics of play has been defined as being
intrinsically motivated and lacking a clear goal [20]. In this way,
the mere definition of play counters the traditional paradigm of
"serious" and traditional Western art music that centers around
extremely clearly defined parameters of instrumentation, form,
and when and how the piece starts and stops. Even so, research
has consistently shown the value of play towards enhancing
creativity, among other positive effects, thus creating space for
"playful" or gamified NIMEs [2].
Reflecting the above definition of play, the first "gamified"
pieces of music can in some sense be seen as the non-deterministic
and aleotoric works of the mid 20th century, such as Terry Riley’s
"In C"4 and Karlheinz Stockhausen’s "Klavierstück XI"5. These
pieces give the performer a notable and unprecedented amount
of freedom to choose how the music unfolds, enabling a sort of
playful form of expression even in the usually strict world of
Western classical music.
Over the course of NIME and other related conferences’ pro-
ceedings, a number of pieces have advertised themselves more
directly as being gamified or incorporating game-like elements.
Notable prior work harnesses standard game-like elements of lev-
els [13], multiplayer collaboration or competition, and sonic feed-
back aimed at shaping the behavior of the player-performer(s).
Existing research mostly has occurred in the domains of dance
[26], or augmented acoustic instruments like the drumset [12]
or violin [14]. While this research is notable for allowing new
forms of expression that incorporate playful elements, no exist-
ing work aims to synthesize the known positive effects of play

into a creative interface that goes beyond the realization of a
single piece.
2.3 Visual Composition Systems and
Instruments
Finally, LIMITER uses a visual composition system as its primary
way of controlling and communicating expressive justly into-
nated sound synthesis to an audience in a way that does not need
or require extensive background in the theory behind it. LIMITER
expands past efforts at visualizing tuning lattices6 by formalizing
the previously fully digital presentation into a physical interface,
and replacing the abstract mathematical notation with a clear,
more easily understood system that revolves around color.
Additionally, LIMITER is an example of a grid-based interface
- a common paradigm for NIMEs ever since the 2007 Yamaha
Tenori-on displayed the extensive expressive potential of the
technique [15]. The key insight of grid interfaces lies in their
ability to quickly and intuitively express the possible field of
musical actions via color and shape to the user [19], thus making
them a perfect candidate for communicating the esoteric tuning
information of LIMITER in a way that is easy to understand.
3 Tuning
LIMITER’s unusual tuning system justifies a brief explanation
of the history and mathematics that underlie it. The following
section will, therefore, outline the theory behind its musical
output, even though a full understanding is not required to be a
skilled performer.
3.1 Microtonality and Just Intonation Systems
The Western musical world has for hundreds of years settled on
using twelve-tone equal temperament as its standard for tuning
and performance. Despite the existence of many other possible
tuning systems and numerous other cultural traditions that utilize
what the Western world perceives as microtonal scale degrees,
Western music now largely relies on this division of the octave
into twelve equal parts. Initially invented in 16th century China,
this system quickly spread throughout Europe and allowed for
enharmonic modulations and the ability to play in any given key
without distant ones being grievously out of tune [16].
As is now widely known, however, this system makes every
key and most intervals slightly out of tune from their "proper"

harmonic ratios that derive from the harmonic series. The major
third in this system, for example, lies 14 cents higher than what it
should be, and the perfect fifth two cents lower. LIMITER instead
makes use of just intonation systems based upon the proper har-
monic ratios of nature as a means of correcting this discrepancy,
thus enabling the exploration of new harmonic colors and tonal
soundscapes.

3.2 The Tuning Lattice
The remainder of this section is devoted to explaining LIMITER’s
specific system of five and seven limit just intonation, all based
around the concept of the harmonic tuning lattice, as introduced
by Leonard Euler in the 18th century [7]. This alternative way
of arranging notes places them not in a sequential scale as is
conventional, but rather in a multidimensional grid. In five limit
just intonation, one multiplies a given center pitch by prime
numbers less than or equal to five. Following past convention7,
we define the vertical axis as moving by justly tuned fifths (a
ratio of 3/2), and the horizontal axis as moving by justly tuned
thirds (a ratio of 5/4), creating the lattice seen in Figure 3.
We then can multiply each numerator or denominator by
a power of two in order to bring the ratios into the range of
one octave, or in other words, a ratio between one and two.
These ratios can then be applied to create actual frequency values,
centered in this case around the note of A4. In order to signify
deviations from 12TET tuning, we use Helmholtz-Ellis notation
[21], a system of visually conveying alterations of one or more
Syntonic commas, a distance of approximately 21.5 cents.
The second tuning system used in LIMITER is seven limit just
intonation, specifically based upon a simplified form of the one
used by the American experimental composer La Monte Young
in his seminal work for solo piano, "the Well Tuned Piano". This
system utilizes both the justly tuned fifth of 3/2 as well as the
"septimal seventh" ratio of 7/4, which at 969 cents is substantially
flatter than the usual 12TET minor 7th, thus allowing for new,
uniquely tuned chords.

4 LIMITER
The name of the instrument derives from the various limit-based
just intonation systems that are used in its musical output. Per-
formance takes the form of the user manipulating a four-way
joystick and eight buttons to draw and transform a series of
shapes on the screen that correspond to justly tuned chords. Each
button offers a different geometric transformation operation of
the current chord, or move in the "game" that is performing with
LIMITER. The basic "rules" are the following:
(1) The screen is divided into a grid that corresponds to coor-
dinates indexing into a tuning lattice.
(2) Play consists of drawing a series of shapes on the screen.
Each shape must have exactly four blocks, implying a
four-note chord.
(3) The very first chord can be placed anywhere, so long as the
blocks are contiguous vertically or horizontally (diagonals
excluded).
(4) After the first chord, the user can draw any new shape,
with the restriction that it must share at least one overlap-
ping block with any previous one, with a few exceptions
that will be discussed in the section on input devices.
(5) Each shape is assigned its own color, with the colors cy-
cling as they eventually repeat.
These rules exist to constrain the possible field of musical pos-
sibilities, both to make playing the instrument less overwhelming
and also to guide to the user towards certain sonic patterns. These
patterns each have rough analogues in traditional Western mu-
sic theory, but roughly center around the principle of generally
guiding the player to connect and voice lead chords smoothly,

usually with at least one shared note (in other words, a pivot
tone modulation). These constraints help ensure that the absence
of a fixed tonal center does not sound especially jarring, and en-
courages the player to hover around various "pools" of tonality,
while perhaps even briefly establishing whispers of conventional
functional harmony.
4.1 Physical Specifications and Construction
LIMITER physically and aesthetically resembles a classic 80s
arcade machine. We modeled the instrument in CAD-based soft-
ware and constructed a number of smaller scale models before
cutting and assembling the final full-sized version using a CNC
machine and table saws. LIMITER is made from a mixture of
MDF and plywood, chosen for its historical authenticity and ease
of finishing. The instrument stands at approximately two feet
wide and six feet tall and is mounted on locking casters for ease
of transportation.
The electronics are housed inside the instrument, secured
directly under the control panel where the joystick and buttons
are attached. LIMITER uses two microcontrollers and a Raspberry
Pi 4 Model B working in tandem, communicating via a simple
UART connection that was chosen for its speed and ease of use.
A number of fabrication processes were used, ranging from PCB
board milling to laser cutting for the acrylic panels to 3D printing
for the custom-made brackets for mounting the speaker and
screen.
4.2 Input Devices
The input devices take the form of a single joystick and eight
buttons, which are controlled by a Raspberry Pi Pico running on
a custom made PCB.
Figure 9: An early prototype PCB design for the input de-
vices.
The joystick is used to move the player’s cursor around the
screen, allowing them to control where they place and draw
shapes. The buttons each contain an LED within, and represent
a particular musical effect or geometric transformation:
(1) DRAW: illuminates the block that the cursor is currently
hovering over, thus marking it as part of the current prospec-
tive chord.
(2) SONIFY: takes the coordinates of the four blocks that are
illuminated and plays them out via the speakers. Does
nothing if four blocks are not yet drawn or if the current
shape is invalid in some way.
(3) SHIFT: changes mode from highlighting the current cur-
sor location to highlighting the most previously sonified
shape. The user can then slide the entire shape to any-
where on the screen, without the usual restriction of hav-
ing to share one block with a previous chord. Does nothing
if at least one shape has not yet been sonified. This op-
eration corresponds musically to the "planing" technique
used by Impressionistic composers to transport the user
to nonfunctionally related key centers [6].
(4) MIRROR: mirrors the previous shape over the center line
of the screen.
(5) ROTATE: rotates the previous shape 90 degrees around a
pivot block.
(6) DELETE: deletes the shape that is currently being drawn,
allowing the user to redraw if they have made a mistake
or wish to change the next chord.
(7) CHANGE TUNING: flashes the screen in a burst of white,
removing all blocks but the most previous one as the tun-
ing lattice dynamically swaps between five and seven limit
just intonation, giving the performer a different set of har-
monic tools.
(8) END GAME: turns the sound synthesis engine off and
slowly fades the screen away, ending the performance.
4.3 Output Devices & Sound Synthesis
The visual and audio system is primarily controlled by a Rasp-
berry Pi 4 Model B in conjunction with a Teensy 4.0 with audio
shield. The Raspberry Pi acts as the main controller, coordinat-
ing communications between the input Pi Pico and the Teensy
and driving the LED system. The screen of the arcade machine
consists of a series of chained LED matrices, while the lights that
illuminate the marquee are a NeoPixel individually addressable
LED strip. Sound is played back with an embedded Bose Solo 5
Soundbar which operates in tandem with the Teensy. A design

challenge that took particular care was designing a structurally
sound 3D printed bracket that both exactly fit the dimensions of
the arcade cabinet and the speaker, but also was secure enough
to hold the speaker’s weight. This took several iterations before
the result was both strong and entirely precise.
The purpose of using lights as opposed to some sort of LCD
screen with symbols as in prior work was to enable the performer
to communicate their performance visually as well as aurally,
without requiring prior knowledge of tuning or microtonal music
theory. Although it is underutilized in the current version of
LIMITER, the individually addressable marquee lights can also
change to show the color that is currently being drawn with.
The sound synthesis engine uses the Teensy Audio Library8, a
patch-based audio system similar to other graphic programming
languages such as MaxMSP or PureData.
5 Results
While the author had composed and performed with LIMITER
extensively during its development, its first major public exhi-
bition came during December of 2024, during a MIT Media Lab
community open house. During this event, the author had the
opportunity to play for an audience of over one hundred people.
Following the performance, a number of audience members lined
up to play the interface, thus proving its desired dual function
as an expressive musical instrument and a game for people to
enjoy.
Additionally, in February of 2025, a software version of LIM-
ITER for use with a USB joystick was developed as part of a Media
Lab educational initiative and collaboration with the Dallas Sym-
phony Orchestra. This version will be deployed and used by local
schools and children as a tool for learning about microtonality
and just intonation and will provide further opportunities for
refining the interface.
6 Discussion
The following section aims to discuss the effectiveness of LIM-
ITER through various paradigms for evaluating new digital mu-
sical instruments.
6.1 Gamified Interfaces vs. Traditional DMIs
The "player/controller/sound producing object" framework pro-
posed first by Perry Cook [5] has long been used by the NIME
8https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gui/
community to consider new DMIs [25]. As Cook argues, the nat-
ural flaw of these systems that involve constructing an artificial
controller for some non-acoustically generated sound is three-
fold: (1) the lack of haptic feedback from the controller/instrument
to the player, (2) the presence of distortions/delays, and (3) the
absence of any notion that the sound comes from the instru-
ment itself [5]. These flaws largely explain the lack of success
of many electronic instruments compared to traditional acoustic
ones where the physical response of playing the instrument is
intimately connected to the actual sonic output.
LIMITER, despite falling into this "player/controller/sound pro-
ducing object" framework has a number of characteristics that
enable it to escape the aforementioned flaws of such interfaces
and achieve a musical experience that feels responsive, intuitive,
and expressive for the performer and audience. LIMITER has very
little latency, and the gestures and mappings are both predictable
and learnable, while leaving room for creative compositional
decisions. For (1), LIMITER leverages the control mechanism
of the arcade joystick and buttons, a relationship that has been
shown to be satisfying precisely because of the inherently physi-
cal properties of the interface; while not literally "haptic" in the
modern sense, an arcade joystick nonetheless exhibits the same
properties of physical feedback that has been shown to increase
a user’s quality of experience in other modalities [1].
While LIMITER does primarily use digital sound generation,
its status as both an instrument and an arcade machine empha-
sizes the visceral sonic relationship afforded by its physical shape.
Arcade machines have achieved such great popularity in part
because of their uniquely multimodal and multisensory playing
experience, causing the very notion of the "arcade aesthetic" to
become entrenched in popular culture as a whole [11]. LIMITER,
similarly, channels this by presenting the bright, colorful lights of
the marquee and screen, the lightly resistant joystick and buttons,
and of course the enormous spectacle of approaching a massive
sound-producing body, thus emphasizing its physical form to the
user. These factors help counter (3) that would otherwise make
performance seem disembodied and therefore, unsatisfying.
6.2 Games as Musical Instruments
The decision to construct LIMITER as an arcade machine as op-
posed to any number of other natural physical forms it could
have taken arose as a result of the author’s desire to take the
unintuitive and esoteric system of just intonation and make it
accessible by placing it in a familiar interface. As one of Perry
Cook’s Principles for Designing Computer Music Controllers
states, "Everyday objects suggest amusing controllers" [4]. While
an arcade machine is not an "an everyday object" in the con-
ventional sense, LIMITER represents a leap forward in terms of
transforming an object that has already a strong nostalgic pres-
ence in the minds of its players into a new conduit for digital
sound production.
LIMITER’s status as a game and a musical interface makes it
significantly easier to engage with. Designer and Stanford Uni-
versity Professor Ge Wang humorously titles this the "tofu burger
principle" [24] - it is a gentle introduction to a, in this case, largely
unfamiliar sound world. In short, LIMITER encourages engage-
ment with what would otherwise feel like an overly academic,
über-serious element of contemporary classical music.

7 Future Work
There are a number of ways in which LIMITER can be improved
for future installations and performances. Most importantly, the
author aims to gather formal, large-scale user feedback from a
range of musical backgrounds to examine the potential creativity-
enhancing effects of the interface. Additionally, from a musical
perspective, the author believes that there is further room to
develop the sound system by adding additional oscillators, audio
effects, and other complexities to create even more varied types
of expression. Finally, the instrument can be made more intuitive,
which would enable its deployment in environments like actual
arcades and other public places where passersby with no mediator
or instruction set could stop and easily perform with it.
8 Conclusion
In this paper we have introduced LIMITER, a gamified musical
instrument for just intonation that enhances creative exploration
through a playful and intuitive visual interface. We have also
outlined the physical makeup and assembly of the instrument,
as well as the various electronic systems that enable its function.
LIMITER allows for the user to compose and perform music
in a novel way, giving the ability for new, expressive musical
experiences to both amateur and professional musicians alike.
