Abstract
The Magnetic Resonator Piano (MRP) is a relatively well-established DMI which 
significantly expands the capabilities of the acoustic piano. This paper presents 
SoftMRP, a Max/MSP patch designed to emulate the physical MRP and thereby to 
allow rehearsal of MRP repertoire and performance techniques using any MIDI 
keyboard and expression pedal; it is hoped that the development of such a tool will 
encourage even more widespread adoption of the original instrument amongst 
composers and performers. This paper explains SoftMRP’s features and limitations, 
discussing the challenges of approximating responses which rely upon the MRP’s 
continuous sensing of key position, and considering ways in which the development of 
the emulation might feed back into the development of the original instrument, both 
specifically and more broadly: since it was designed by a composer, based on his 
experience of writing for the instrument, it offers the MRP’s designers an insight into 
how the instrument is conceptualised and understood by the musicians who use it.

Introduction
The Magnetic Resonator Piano (MRP) is a DMI which significantly expands the 
capabilities of the acoustic piano [1][2]. Taking the form of a kit which may be installed 
in any grand piano, the MRP uses electromagnetic actuators to induce vibration in the 
strings, while leaving the conventional hammer action unaffected [3][4][5]. This allows 
the performer to achieve precise dynamic shaping of notes after the relevant keys have 
been depressed, and also (by means of changes in the frequency of the current passed 
through the actuators) to produce effects such as pitch bends and harmonics.
Since its creation in 2009, the MRP has been used regularly in performances and 
recording projects, and has built up a repertoire to which many composers have 
contributed1 ; it is now, in short, a relatively well-established instrument which has 
already demonstrated a degree of longevity.

One significant remaining obstacle to its even wider adoption, however, may lie in the 
fact that it can often be difficult for the pianist preparing for a performance on the 
MRP to access the instrument for the amount of rehearsal time they might ideally 
want. They must travel to wherever an instrument is currently set up: either the 
performance venue itself (assuming that it is possible for the installation to remain in 
place throughout the period leading up to the performance) or the MRP’s ‘home’ – the 
Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary, University of London – where it occupies a 
studio which is usually in high demand from a variety of other users. Besides this, the 
pianist’s only other option is to work as best they can on whatever (unmodified) 
instrument they have at home.
The benefits of a software emulation of the MRP, then, are clear: as a practice tool, it 
could lessen the challenges (and reduce the time) involved in mounting a successful 
MRP recital, thus encouraging more performers to undertake to give such recitals 
more often. Emboldened by the increased likelihood of receiving well-prepared 
performances which satisfactorily realize their creative intentions, more composers 
might choose to write for it. Finally, in turn, better-prepared performances are more 
likely to serve as effective showcases for the instrument’s possibilities and encourage 
wider networks of performers and composers to explore them for themselves.
Context
The importance of ensuring the longevity of DMI’s and the compositions which employ 
them is widely understood and appreciated, as are the obstacles which may need to be 
overcome in order to do so [6][7][8][9][10][11]. Emulations have certainly played their 
part in this, usually when the technology used by specific composers in specific pieces 
has become obsolete or inaccessible [12][13][14][15][16]. The need for performers of 
DMI’s to learn and practise new kinds of skills is also well recognized [17][18].
At the same time, applications have been built which guide and assist the rehearsal of 
new performing techniques on traditional acoustic instruments [19][20], and which 
propose emulation as a means of practising acoustic instruments which may be 
difficult to access or transport [21]. As a digital emulation designed to facilitate skill 
acquisition and rehearsal of repertoire for a specific DMI, SoftMRP therefore draws 
together a number of existing strands in NIME-based and broader organological 
research.

Background
The physical MRP receives its input from two main sources: an optical scanner bar 
fitted to the piano keyboard, which continuously senses the height of each key, and a 
foot pedal. Typically, the pedal controls the overall volume level of the induced 
resonance, with key position being used to generate further dynamic variation within 
the range thus defined. Compositions for MRP may therefore require the performer to 
learn to co-ordinate unfamiliar combinations of movements involving both hands and 
both feet (if the sustain pedal is also used).
More specifically, performers may have to develop the ability to depress keys (perhaps 
quite quickly) without producing a sound, in order to allow notes to be faded up 
gradually, from nothing, using the pedal. Producing a pitch bend also requires a level 
of precise control over key position which is not involved in conventional piano playing: 
to slide between adjacent notes, the destination key must be slowly depressed while 
the first key is gradually released.
In all of these cases, it is obviously desirable not only to practise the physical 
movements involved (which would be possible on a conventional piano), but also, while 
doing so, to be able to hear at least a reasonably close approximation of the effect they 
will produce, accustomizing the performer to new relationships between action and 
outcome.
This is also important in aspects of MRP behavior which, although the performance 
techniques they involve are straightforward enough not to require any great amount of 
practice, nevertheless involve the generation of significantly augmented acoustic 
outputs. When the MRP is in harmonics mode, the white keys immediately above (or, 
depending on configuration, below) any depressed key will trigger successive 
overtones in the harmonic series of the corresponding pitch. Composers may choose to 
combine these tones with the conventional response of the hammer action, or, if the 
keys are depressed silently, to deploy them on their own. When playing full-spectrum 
resonance tones, meanwhile, the sound may be modulated by exerting further 
pressure on a key once it has been fully depressed: this makes possible a precisely-
controllable vibrato effect. In all of these situations, the performer’s job in preparing 
for a performance is made considerably more difficult if they do not hear these 
outcomes when rehearsing.
SoftMRP responds to many of these needs. It also draws heavily upon my own 
experience of composing, and subsequently attending rehearsals of, a piece for MRP

5
called l.v. in 2016-7: this requires the performer to be proficient in many of the 
techniques mentioned above. Indeed, the software grew from an initial basic emulation 
of the instrument’s harmonics mode, created in order to audition (and confirm the 
playability of) various microtonal chords, built up using some of the higher overtones 
of different fundamentals. This grounding of the software in my own experience of the 
instrument, and the refraction of the instrument’s capabilities and demands through 
the lens of one particular piece, have inevitably strongly influenced my decisions as to 
which MRP features SoftMRP seeks to emulate, and which it does not.
Description
Overview
SoftMRP is a Max/MSP patch which may be downloaded from 
http://www.jpitkin.co.uk/Tools_software.html. It is played with a MIDI keyboard, 
expression pedal and sustain pedal: standard equipment which is widely and 
inexpensively available, even to the less specialist musician. The sounds it is intended 
to simulate can be divided into three categories: the conventional, hammer-action 
response of the piano; full-spectrum tones produced by the induced resonance; and 
harmonics. Piano notes may be routed to another MIDI application, such as a DAW or a 
standalone virtual instrument; to a VST plug-in hosted within Max/MSP; or to the 
computer’s basic, built-in MIDI sound source (e.g. the Apple QuickTime synth). Full-
spectrum resonance tones may also be routed in any of these ways, but may 
additionally be played using ‘SoftMRP Sounds’, a built-in set of samples of a basic 
synthesizer pad sound. A mixer allows the various sound sources the patch may 
employ to be balanced in a way which is felt to match the physical performance set-up.
Harmonics may only be produced internally, using a related set of samples. This is 
because of the difficulty involved in sending a third-party virtual instrument the 
precise combination of MIDI messages required to produce non-tempered pitches 
(particularly when these have to be sounded in combination with tempered chromatic 
tones, or other harmonics which require different degrees of tuning adjustment). For 
similar reasons, pitch bend functionality is only available when using SoftMRP Sounds: 
producing the effect with MIDI control data would become quite complex whenever 
one note had to be bent while another stayed where it was, for example. MIDI 
aftertouch, if it is supported by the keyboard being used, will modulate the full-
spectrum resonance tones in SoftMRP Sounds in a way which imitates the physical 
MRP (both polyphonic and channel aftertouch are recognized); if another sound source

6
is being used, the aftertouch control data can optionally be passed through to it, in 
order to allow the user to configure a similar response.
Special features
SoftMRP’s GUI (see Figure 1) is designed not to replicate the software element of the 
physical MRP - this is usually operated by an engineer – but rather to allow the 
performer easily to configure and switch between the various settings that may be 
required by the piece they are practising. This may be demonstrated by the way in 
which SoftMRP allows the user to set up ‘Exceptions’.
As mentioned earlier, the basic harmonic response mode involves the white notes 
above (or, optionally, below) a held fundamental note triggering successive overtones 
of it. But it may sometimes be desirable for this pattern of response to be adjusted in 
some way: for example, because the physical stretch required in order to sustain the 
fundamental while also triggering the desired harmonic would otherwise exceed the 
performer’s reach.
 Figure 2 shows an example of this from l.v.. If F3 and A♭3 are held down as 
fundamentals, playing C4 will trigger both of the lower two notes of the desired triad 
(C4 is a 5th above F3, and a 3rd above A♭3; F5 is P5 of F3, and E♭5 is P3 of A♭3). This 
can easily be played with the right hand. The upper note, however, is P11 of D2; if it 
were to be triggered below the fundamental (which is necessary to avoid a further 
overtones of F3 being triggered), the note required would be A1. This would create an 
interval (A1:D2) that is impossible for the left hand to encompass. A temporary

7
reconfiguration must be put in place, then, to allow a closer note (for example C2) to 
trigger P11 of D2.
In the physical MRP set-up, a new patch would be programmed to accommodate this 
change, and then recalled via the command line when required. In SoftMRP, to simplify 
this process, and allow the performer to stand in for the engineer/operator in a 
practice situation, such rules or ‘Exceptions’ may be established by constructing 
logical statements using a series of number boxes and multiple-choice options (see 
Figure 3), somewhat in the style of Logic’s Transform window2. As many Exceptions as 
are required within a piece can be kept in memory, and activated or deactivated 
individually as required.
Similarly, the ‘Keysplit’ note, which, in harmonics mode, determines the pitch of 
fundamental at or above which partials are triggered by successively higher keys, and 
below which by successively lower ones, may need to be changed several times in the 
course of a single piece or movement. Again, on the physical MRP such changes need 
to be incorporated into a patch. In SoftMRP, however, a sequence of keysplit notes may 
be entered, stored, and then sequentially advanced through as required. Both keysplit 
sequences and sets of Exceptions are included when a Preset (a snapshot of all current 
SoftMRP settings) is saved.

Limitations
SoftMRP’s current limitations reflect the relative lack of sophistication of the sensors 
of a MIDI keyboard compared with the continuous optical sensing of  the physical MRP. 
MIDI, of course, only records key position as ‘on’ or ‘off’: this makes gradual attacks or 
decays resulting from gradual depressions and releases impossible to emulate 
precisely. It also complicates any attempt to imitate the physical MRP’s other 
harmonics mode, in which rapid tremolos of partial depressions on a single note give 
rise to glissandos which sweep upwards through its overtones. Neither of these 
capabilities are emulated in SoftMRP3, and for similar reasons, its pitch bend 
programming is something of a compromise: when an adjacent key is pressed down at 
a velocity which falls below a preset threshold, the sustained pitch slides half of the 
way towards it; when the original key is then released, the glissando is completed.
SoftMRP also differs from its physical counterpart in another way: it offers a level of 
consistency of response and cleanness of timbre that the MRP, by its nature, cannot be 
relied upon to produce (it may well be that, for many who have used the instrument, 
this is part of its charm)4. Every grand piano will interact with the MRP’s sensors and 
actuators in a different way: different harmonics, for example, will sound more 
strongly or weakly above different fundamentals in different registers in a way that 
may be difficult to predict.
It was considered whether SoftMRP should attempt to simulate this element of 
unpredictability in some way (a little like how digital emulations of analogue 
synthesizers may be set to detune the pitches they produce by small, random 
amounts). However, this would raise the possibility of SoftMRP simulating, for 
example, a balancing problem in a chord of several harmonics which subsequently 
turned out not to be replicated in a performance on the physical instrument. Instead, 
allowances are made for the gradual weakening of the volume of harmonics which 
occur to some extent in every MRP installation towards the higher partials of each 
harmonic series, and where fundamentals are towards the higher registers; in other 
respects, SoftMRP responds like a rather utopian, ‘ideal conditions’ installation of the 
physical MRP.
Discussion
It was originally intended that, by the time of writing this paper, it would have been 
possible to evaluate SoftMRP by making it available to several pianists who have 
performed on the physical MRP, and seeking their opinions on how closely the 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression SoftMRP: a Software Emulation of the Magnetic Resonator Piano
9
experience of playing the two versions of the instrument matched one another, as well 
as how useful they felt SoftMRP would be as a practice tool overall. However, delays 
relating to changes in circumstance brought on by the current pandemic have meant 
that this process remains ongoing. It has nevertheless been invaluable to have the 
assistance of one such performer, Feifei Zhang, in testing the portability of the 
software from one system to another.
It is likely that with each different piece SoftMRP is used to rehearse, more additional 
effects or configurations will be revealed as being desirable to emulate, thus directing 
further refinement or expansion of the software’s capabilities. It will also be valuable 
to have more opinions on how closely SoftMRP’s built-in sounds match different 
performer’s senses of how the physical MRP actually sounds - and how much this 
matters in a tool intended for practice rather than performance.
It might also be interesting to consider whether ongoing use of SoftMRP might even 
influence future development of the physical MRP. If performers become used to the 
idea of setting up different configurations using Exceptions and Keysplit sequences, for 
example, rather than relying on an engineer to save and recall patches from the 
command line, might it make sense to explore the possibility of giving them the option 
to interact with the physical instrument in the same way (in other words, to emulate 
the emulation)5 [22]?
Questions such as these serve as reminders of the broader importance of asking what 
(and who) emulations are for, what aspects or features of the original it is therefore 
more or less important for them to emulate, and what limits there might be to the 
extent to which it is possible for them to do so6.
One distinctive feature of this particular emulation, of course, is that it has been built 
by someone other than the designer of the original instrument. This has potential 
disadvantages: I have no background in electrical engineering, and therefore only a 
very incomplete understanding of how the physical MRP is constructed, and how it 
actually works. As a result, what I have built might more accurately be described as an 
emulation of my own conception of the instrument, based to a large extent on my own 
recollections of how it sounds and responds, and even on what it reminds me of 
(variously: an organ, an ondes Martenot, a ‘warm pad’ synthesizer preset, the ‘fizz’ of 
polyphonic aftertouch mapped to cutoff frequency).
All of this, however, gives the designer of the original instrument a potentially 
interesting insight into how (and to what extent) it is understood by those who use it, 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression SoftMRP: a Software Emulation of the Magnetic Resonator Piano
10
in much the same way as it can be valuable for any DMI designer, as Oliver Hödl points 
out [23], to have other musicians compose for their instrument because of the 
inevitably unforeseen ways in which they will approach and seek to deploy it7. It is in 
these kinds of ways that I hope SoftMRP might be seen as an example of how an 
emulation might not only serve as a useful substitute for the instrument on which it is 
based, but also help to accelerate its development into an ever-more established, and 
no longer quite so New, IME.
