ABSTRACT 
In music and computer science classrooms, Blind and Visu-
ally Impaired (BVI) learners are often not given alternatives 
to visual technologies and materials. FiLOrk, an ensemble 
at the Filomen M. D’Agostino Greenberg Music School, is 
made up of fve BVI high school learners who studied and 
performed computer music using the live coding language 
Tidal Cycles over the course of a semester. To make FiLOrk 
approachable and accessible we wrote a new curriculum fea-
turing audio/tactile learning materials, and we designed 
a collaborative web editor for use with learners’ assistive 
technologies, including screen readers and braille displays. 
In this article, we describe fndings from classroom obser-
vations and interviews. We highlight how learners wres-
tled with persistent accessibility challenges, connected pre-
existing music knowledge with Tidal Cycles concepts, cre-
ated a culture of respect and support, and made suggestions 
for improving FiLOrk. We conclude by discussing opportu-
nities to make live coding ensembles accessible to both BVI 
people and high school learners.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) learners are disadvan-
taged in both computer programming and electronic music 
because they are highly ocularcentric–i.e. reliant on vision 
ability to access (Figure 1). Programming environments de-
signed for learning, like Scratch, use visual drag-and-drop 
interfaces [20, 28], while software development tools use col-
orful text, underlines, and suggestions to aid sighted pro-

grammers [27]. Similarly, commercial music applications 
use highly visual graphic user interfaces [25, 30]. 
To navigate visual interfaces, BVI people use assistive 
technologies like screen readers that verbalize screen con-
tents, or refreshable braille displays [2]. Unfortunately, many 
software applications do not support assistive technologies. 
For example, neither Finale, used widely by composers [15], 
nor Scratch, used widely by young coders, [28] support 
screen readers. 
We formed a collaborative live coding ensemble at The 
Fil’ Community Music School [8] made up entirely of BVI 
high school learners to address ocularcentrism in music and 
computing education. We designed text.management, a col-
laborative coding environment, and we created tactile and 
large print learning materials. For twelve weeks, the fve 
members of FiLOrk (Fil’ Laptop Orchestra, name chosen 
by members despite the ensemble’s size) learned to generate 
beats and melodies with Tidal Cycles (Tidal for short) [17] 
and performed live. In this paper, we frst list research ques-
tions guiding FiLOrk. We then indicate infuential prior 
work. We explain our learning environment and interview 
protocol. Finally, we share learners’ experiences rehearsing 
and performing, and we suggest future areas of inquiry.

faces often inaccessible or limited for BVI users [24, 25]. 
1.1 Research Questions 
Our guiding research question is: How can collaborative live 
coding be made accessible to novice BVI learners? We aim 
to address this question through technological, curricular, 
and collaborative interventions. 
1.1.1 Technology 
• What accessibility barriers exist in common tools used 
by laptop ensembles and live coders? 
• How can developers improve accessibility? 
1.1.2 Curriculum 
• In what ways are current teaching methods ill-suited 
to BVI learners? 
• How can the environment, e.g. topics, instructional 
materials, and classroom setup, be adapted to support 
BVI learners? 
1.1.3 Collaboration 
• How do learners notate and share their ideas? 
• How do learners communicate during lessons and per-
formance? 
2. RELATED WORK 
FiLOrk is primarily infuenced by laptop ensemble / orches-
tra and live coding movements. 
2.1 Laptop Ensemble Pedagogy 
Laptop ensembles, such as the Princeton Laptop Orchestra 
(PLOrk), ofer an educational model based on collaborative 
computer music performance [33, 34]. Music provides a 
practical entry point for novice coders, while the ensemble 
environment supports individual exploration and collabo-
rative learning. Just as PLOrk was aware of its orchestral 
lineage, (e.g. using terms like ‘conductor’ and ‘concertmas-
ter’ and equipping musicians with speaker arrays that could 
produce sounds akin to acoustic instruments), we envision 
FiLOrk as a response to western classical ocularcentrisms 
like sight reading and watching the conductor. Prior lap-
top orchestra research has explored visual notation [11] and 
communication strategies [7] unsuitable for BVI learners. 
2.2 Live Coding and Inclusion 
Community norms around open software and inclusion make 
live coding a fertile ground for accessibility research, though 
best practices at supporting disabled people have only re-
cently been explored. For example, Skuse interviewed musi-
cians wide a variety of disabilities to incorporate their needs 
and suggestions in the in future live coding designs [31]. Al-
though no participants explicitly identifed as BVI, many 
suggestions – such as confgurable interfaces – are relevant 
to FiLOrk. Subsequent work explored the technical chal-
lenges implementing collaborative music systems accessibly 
[32]. 
A common“accessibility”concern of live code performance 
is the extent to which the underlying technical, algorithmic 
sound generators are legible to a general audience. Code 
is frequently projected, so its readability presumes a visual 
presentation of text and applies theories of image analysis 
[13]. Prior projects have attempted to make live code more 
understandable through annotations [29] and novel visual-
ization [19], but have rarely, if ever, extended beyond visual 
signifers. Strikingly, the performance pointilism (2012) em-
phasized the opacity of code by rendering it in braille, using 
it as an “empty symbol,” only understandable as abstract 
symbols [14]. The performance assumes no braille knowl-
edge among the audience, and the fact that images of braille 
are inaccessible to BVI audience members is an inadvertent 
(though thematically appropriate) outcome. 
2.2.1 Live Coding Education 
Many live coding environments have been taught in k-12 
classrooms [16, 29, 9, 1, 5, 21] demonstrating signifcant af-
fordances for both music and computing education. FiLOrk 
builds on this prior work through highlighting the needs and 
abilities of BVI learners. 
3. METHODS 
Broadly, we use a Design Based Research approach in which 
we situate technical and curricular designs in an authentic 
learning environment, and we report on how that environ-
ment impacts our understanding of the interventions’ efec-
tiveness [4]. This study, centered around FiLOrk’s inaugu-
ral 12-week semester, refects a nascent phase of our ongoing 
research. Below, we report how we organized FiLOrk, de-
signed technologies and learning materials, and interviewed 
participants. 
3.1 FiLOrk Overview 
Figure 2: FiLOrk’s inaugural performance. From left: Mateo 
(iPad), Cindy (laptop), Olivia (iPad, braille display), Alice 
(laptop), Donna (iPad). 
FiLOrk gathered in a classroom for 45 minutes during 
an all-day comprehensive learning program on Saturdays. 
FiLOrk’s frst semester curriculum combined lessons on Tidal 
with opportunities to practice ensemble performance (Table 
1). We drew from existing resources, e.g. “Learning Tidal” 
by Alex McLean, but emphasized topics we felt would be ap-
pealing and approachable for this group of high school-age 
participants. For example, we covered Euclidean rhythms, 
given that learners had taken a drum circle class, and we 
avoided longer samples because we felt chopping audio could 
be difcult. We typically introduced two concepts per week. 
3.2 Participants 
Five high school learners joined. Two identify as blind while 
three identify as visually impaired. As shown in Table 2, 
learners range in age and instrument, but all sing and have 
formal training in western music theory and notation. Par-
ticipants knew each other prior to joining the ensemble. 
3.3 Hardware and Software Setup 
Participants used three distinct technology setups. Cindy 
and Alice (pseudonyms) used a Macbook Pro, VoiceOver 
screen reader, and braille display. Due to technical issues 
Cindy did not use her display between weeks nine and eleven 
while Alice began bringing her display in week three. Mateo 
and Donna used iPads with text enlargement and external

keyboards. Olivia, a learner with braille knowledge and 
some vision ability, used a hybrid of her peers’ approaches 
consisting of an iPad, VoiceOver, and Mantis, a combination 
braille display and QWERTY keyboard. 
In class, learners coded in text.management, a browser-
based collaborative live-coding environment we designed to 
support screen readers and meet needs as they arose. De-
tailed further in [12], text.management uses CodeMirror 6, 
a recent version of the popular code editor library with 
improved screen reader support [10], which we have been 
confguring to mitigate VoiceOver bugs, such as with line 
highlight and the default keybindings. All music was exe-
cuted by Tidal running on the lead researcher’s computer. 
VoiceOver users heard their screen readers only on their de-
vices. To support home use, we installed Tidal and VSCode 
for the two laptop users, and we demonstrated Estuary, a 
web-based live coding environment that supports a subset 
of Tidal [22]. 
3.4 Learning Materials 
As learners cannot read projected code, we demonstrated 
directly in text.management and created supplemental ma-
terials: 
1. The class website was designed to be accessed with 
screen readers and used outside of class.1 
FiLOrk class website started in 2022: 
https://huriphoonado.github.io/laptopclass/ 
2. Weekly reference handouts in large print and braille 
were made to present brief summaries of concepts with 
code examples as learners cannot easily access multi-
ple windows on screen in parallel. 
3. Tactile graphics were made using braille and swell touch, 
a special paper that makes ink rise when heated through 
a swell form machine. We adapted two concepts con-
ventionally taught visually: Euclidean rhythms, rep-
resented with geometric shapes superimposed over a 
circle, and oscillators, represented as amplitude curves 
graphed over time. We printed a standard ink layer 
making them universally accessible (Figure 4). 
Figure 4: Tactile graphics used to teach waveforms and Eu-
clidean rhythms containing swellform, braille, and print, and 
a large print reference handout (bottom right). 
3.5 Classroom Styles 
Classes were run by the lead researcher and one or two assis-
tants. Each week consisted of technology setup, recap, and 
main activity. We explored four primary teaching styles: 
1. Lecture: We presented new concepts and prompted 
learner responses. 
2. Open Work: Learners sat around a large table. Each 
worked independently in a commented section of the 
document. Generally, learners worked with similar 
code using diferent sounds. 
1
3. Groups: We split the class into two groups, (Cindy / 
Olivia / Mateo and Donna / Alice), at separate tables. 
Each group was provided starter code, instructions, 
and their audio was separated between monitors. 
4. Performance Practice: We composed a short piece in-
volving starter code and instructions for learners to 
make changes over time, e.g. modifying rhythms, ap-
plying efects, etc. Performance practices were in-
tended to help learners practice live coding, listening, 
and signalling. 
3.6 Interview Protocol 
After a fnal performance, we conducted fve semi-structured, 
hour-long Zoom interviews that were recorded and tran-
scribed verbatim. Interviews were led by the frst author, 
while an additional researcher took notes and asked follow-
up questions. First, in a warm-up, we asked learners to com-
pare expectations with their experiences. Then, we asked 
demographic questions to gather self-reported pronouns, vi-
sion descriptions, and prior experience. What followed was 
guided by our three research questions (§1.1): We asked 
participants to discuss using text.management with assis-
tive technologies, learning Tidal, and collaborating. We 
derived specifc questions from classroom observations–for 
example, we asked Donna to share her process leading the 
fnal performance, and we asked Olivia to describe how she 
used VoiceOver. Finally, we asked learners to share hopes 
and suggestions for the ensemble’s future. 
3.6.1 Analysis 
We conducted a thematic analysis on the interview tran-
scripts resembling Braun and Clarke’s method [3]. We used 
a combination of deductive and inductive coding. While 
we began with three overarching categories guided by our 
research questions–Technology, Curriculum, Collaboration– 
codes emerged out of interviews. Following each interview, 
two researchers present discussed and listed initial codes to 
make sense of what they heard. After interviews concluded, 
the research team worked independently to highlight quo-
tations, tag with existing codes, and/or suggest new codes. 
We then met to discuss the codebook and identify redun-
dancies and outliers (i.e. rarely used codes). After one 
more iteration, in which researchers reviewed transcripts 
and noted quotations with disagreement, we met to achieve 
consensus. In preparing this document, we refned themes 
and selected especially pertinent quotations. 
4. FINDINGS 
Our fndings are organized by our research questions (§1.1): 
technological, curricular, and collaborative components of 
making a laptop ensemble accessible to BVI learners. 
4.1 Technology 
text.management enabled learners to write Tidal code using 
a range of assistive technologies and hardware setups. They 
described how they accessed text.management, typed code, 
and used Tidal at home. 
4.1.1 Accessibility of text.management 
Learners found text.management accessible compared with 
previous experiences. Cindy told us, “Code Academy didn’t 
work with the screen reader I was using. So, my sister read 
everything, and I would dictate what I wanted, and then she 
would type it. It was very frustrating. That’s why I quit.” 
Donna similarly refected, “I had to get a laptop with Zoom 
Text so I could actually see my code because it wasn’t like 
Safari or something. It was awful. At the start of every class 
I would spend half of it fghting with my laptop. Because 
the laptop was outdated it ran slower, and it was running 
more programs because of Zoom Text.” 
text.management worked with learners’ preferred setups. 
Both Donna and Mateo used iPads due to the ease of naviga-
tion aforded by the touchscreen. For example, Mateo said, 
“I prefer pinching because it’s easier to maneuver around,” 
while Donna said, “I did some combination of zooming by 
pinching and also the triple tap. I did have it zoomed-in a 
good amount, where if I had a long line of code, like our fnal 
project, I wouldn’t have seen it all without scrolling, which 
is why I put each measure on a separate line.” Cindy and 
Alice used text.management with and without braille dis-
plays, fnding they improved navigation. Alice said, “it was 
a little difcult not having my braille display. My braille 
display made it a lot easier.” Cindy suggested, “when it 
works, braille revolutionizes things. I should have done this 
earlier, but using headphones for computer speech helps a 
lot. You have to turn the volume up, but at least you have 
your own isolated audio you can make talk as verbosely as 
you want without interrupting anyone else.” 
Olivia faced signifcant accessibility barriers with her unique 
setup, fnding that VoiceOver on iPad misrepresented code: 
“It was separating whenever there was a space. I’d have 
to scroll over each individual part instead of reading the 
entire line. Then when I try to click, it selects the entire 
line.” As a result, Olivia often held the iPad close to her 
face and manually positioned her cursor through touch: “I 
had to keep turning VoiceOver of and on again to get my 
cursor right.” While Olivia said “I can deal with it,” it was 
“frustrating at times.” 
4.1.2 Typing Music 
Learners contrasted their live coding experiences with other 
music technologies, citing possibilities and challenges af-
forded by the open-ended text editor. Cindy said, “I think 
the interface is simpler. You’re writing everything so you 
have ultimate control over your environment. But, it’s also 
more complicated: You can’t just hit a button and change 
a parameter or drag a slider. You have to remember all 
the syntax, and you have to write it correctly.” Similarly, 
Mateo felt that “some faws of having such an open ended 
canvas is fnding a direction – Say you want to make a beat 
or something and you know what it is, you just don’t know 
how to notate it.” 
Learners described how typing could be mechanically dif-
fcult. For example, Olivia said, “I’m stopping and checking 
every few characters. I keep forgetting which is the right 
key: which is slash, which is dollar sign, and the angle brack-
ets are a bit frustrating to fnd. Like code: I’ve just been 
learning for four months, but I’ve been typing for over ten 
years.” text.management, like other editors, auto-completes 
enclosures such as quotation marks and parentheses to save 
keystrokes, but learners disliked the feature. Donna said “if 
I type my closed quote, it gives me the open and the closed, 
and I have to delete the open. I think it’s weird when you 
get more than you typed.” Furthermore, VoiceOver did not 
announce additional enclosure insertions, meaning Cindy, 
Alice, and Olivia could be unaware of visible characters.

Table 2: FiLOrk Members 
Olivia, Donna, and Cindy experienced difculties using Tidal 
outside of text.management. (Mateo and Alice did not try.) 
Olivia and Donna used Estuary [22]. Olivia refected that, 
“I couldn’t make any sound, and the code there is difer-
ent and I didn’t want to confuse myself more,” while Donna 
similarly remembered, “I would put in a rhythm I knew, 
and it wouldn’t come out right. I think that’s the iPad be-
cause I tried Estuary on my friend’s laptop and it worked 
fne.” Cindy used Tidal with VSCode, experiencing unex-
pected lag: “I was having fun when it worked. I did notice 
Visual Studio, or the combination of Visual Studio, Super-
Collider and VoiceOver, oftentimes lagged. I don’t know if 
it’s my computer, or the programs, or a combination. It 
was probably because it made noises on my computer itself 
rather than sending them to yours during class. It was a 
lot laggier.” Furthermore, Cindy’s installation broke after 
an update, needing help to reinstall Haskell. Finally, while 
Mateo did not write code outside class, he took photos to 
show his family,“this is what I learned, like how and why I 
am using it.” 
4.1.4 Technology Recommendations 
VoiceOver users requested that we fx how text.management 
conveys text. (As discussed below in Section 4.3, collabo-
rative editing exacerbates bugs.) Most also felt that error 
feedback, shown in an adjacent area, could be improved. 
Donna pointed out that “everybody’s errors get put there,” 
instead of it highlighting “Olivia has an error, Mateo has 
an error,” so it would be better if it could “denote that you 
have triggered your code and there’s something wrong.” 
4.2 Curriculum 
Learners found the curriculum relevant, enjoyable, and ac-
cessible. For example, Donna noted that the “diagrams for 
Euclidean rhythms and waveforms are really good because 
you could not have explained a saw wave if you tried ver-
bally,” while Cindy felt that the “website was good because 
there wasn’t too much we had to do to start coding. Every-
thing was legible.” However, learners discussed challenges 
remembering syntax, reconciling their rhythm understand-
ing with cycles, and understanding code as it grew complex. 
4.2.1 Reading & Remembering Syntax 
Many difculties arose out of Tidal syntax and behaviors. 
For example, Olivia argued that efects arguments felt ar-
bitrary: “I have trouble remembering - like what is from 0 
to 1, what is even numbers, why does this only go up to 
10 or something?” Cindy told us the difculty remember-
ing syntax rules is complicated by VoiceOver limitations: 
“The little things become difcult. If you put something 
using pipe, you put it in brackets. There are other exam-
ples... Like slow and fast, you put in parentheses outside 
the quotes. It’s especially difcult for screen readers because 
they don’t announce this by default. So you just have to 
remember and hope it works.” Both Mateo and Donna felt 
that while the tactile graphics helped them understand the 
concept of Euclidean rhythms, it did not help them remem-
ber the syntax (Table 1). Mateo said, “it was a lot easier 
to to visualize what was going to happen than Tidal on the 
page.” 
4.2.2 Reconciling Rhythms & Meters with Cycles 
Figure 5: Rhythms hand-written by Donna and later con-
verted to Tidal patterns for the performance. The alto and 
bass parts were especially difcult due to dotted eighth and 
quarter notes. (The part labelled “Kevin” is an inside-joke.) 
All were experienced with western music conventions and 
relied on prior rhythmic knowledge when attempting to con-
ceive of and code cyclical patterns. At times, prior knowl-
edge aided code comprehension. Donna argued, “because 
we all have a solid foundation, we could hear our output 
and know what had gone wrong in terms of, ‘well, I wanted 
eighth eighth quarter eighth eighth quarter’ and I got ’quar-
ter quarter quarter quarter.”’ Cindy similarly felt, “gener-
ating sounds within a 4/4 pattern, and grouping things by 
bracket, and using asterisks and stuf was pretty easy be-
cause I could ft it into a 4/4 grid in my head.” At other 
times, learners grew frustrated when they were unable to 
code a rhythm they knew. In the fnal project, Donna 
transcribed fve rhythms for each of the learners to code 
(Figure 5). Two rhythms with dotted notes were difcult, 
and Olivia remembered, “the dotted eighth note that I just 
couldn’t – that I had some help fguring out how to write. 
For quarter notes, I can write like one underscore. Is that 
right? But there’s no dotted eighth.” 
4.2.3 Debugging Randomness and Effects 
Learners relied on their ears to discern whether code exe-
cuted and behaved as expected. However, as Donna sum-
marized, “you don’t know exactly what your code is go-
ing to sound like when it gets to a certain level of com-
plexity.” Learners identifed how randomness and some ef-
fects made changes imperceptible. Olivia said “I think the 
most frustrating for me was randomness. Pipe. That con-
fused me so much. Every beat has whatever chance to be 
played.” Donna identifed perception limitations during per-
formance, “there was so much going on, and especially with 
randomness you can’t tell if it was hitting a new cycle or if 
it was the change you wanted. Sometimes with delay and 
randomness and squiz [distortion] and stuf, you don’t know 
what it’s going to sound like, so you might not be paying 
attention for the right change.” Mateo considered, “the per-
formance aspect is really fun because you never know what 
is going to happen, but that is also the stressful thing.” 
4.2.4 Curriculum Recommendations 
While participants appreciated the learning environment, 
they ofered suggestions. Cindy and Donna felt we could 
improve the Euclidean rhythm tactile graphics for sighted 
and blind learners. Donna suggested utilizing color to map 
graphic elements to code: “The three values in the Eu-
clidean rhythm - number of beats per divisions of a cy-
cle with x delay - if you put those in corresponding colors, 
it might have been faster to click - ’Oh, this value does 
that.”’ Cindy suggested we consult an expert, stating she 
felt like our tactile graphics were “created from the per-
spective of a sighted person,” and though “tactile graph-
ics are good... having the dual perspective of blind people 
who have gone through STEM in college would be useful.” 
Additionally, Donna emphasized teaching how to recognize 
common Tidal syntactic patterns: “Instead of say, intro-
ducing gain as a thing, and then squiz as another thing, 
do: ’space after your quotes, hashtag, the efect, and then 
a value.”’ Finally, all felt that instructors ofered help too 
quickly. Olivia requested, “you explain the basics and then 
let us loose.” 
4.3 Collaboration 
Figure 6: Learners in rehearsal. iPads, tactile graphics, and 
keyboards are scattered around. 
Learners enjoyed collaborating. Alice summarized, “we 
actually stood together, and we listened to each other.” 
They detailed virtual collaboration inside text.management 
and strategies to maintain awareness and respect in the 
classroom. 
4.3.1 Lack of Screen Reader Support for Co-Editing 
A major technical difculty we discovered is that VoiceOver 
does not trigger audio feedback in Safari when other users 
make edits. While Mateo and Donna were able to see nearby 
changes with magnifed text, Cindy, Alice, and Olivia did 
not know when someone else edited code on the same line 
until they made a change or moved their cursor. As a re-
sult, the three VoiceOver users found group activities dis-
orienting. Cindy said, “Mateo and I were working on the 
same code, and it was really hard to keep up because braille 
doesn’t refresh automatically. When there were syntactical 
mistakes, I couldn’t read everything fast enough to deter-
mine the problem. So, I ended up getting really frustrated 
because everything was out of my control.” Olivia felt, “it 
was easiest when we worked on separate lines,” but the uni-
fed text area meant learners could still accidentally disrupt 
others. Near the start of the class, Alice held option while 
moving her cursor to navigate, consequently shufing ev-
eryone’s code. (By default, VoiceOver commands use com-
mand and option keys held together.) 
4.3.2 Collaborative Live Coding Versus Writing 
Learners identifed practical diferences between live coding 
and collaborating in Google Docs. Donna felt live coding 
is more independent: “I care more about what somebody 
in a Google Doc is typing than what exactly Olivia’s code 
is - unless she has a problem that she needs me to look at. 
Even though everything in text.management happens at the 
same time, it’s very much independent. If you’re editing a 
history project, and you know that somebody didn’t explain 
Dag Hammarskj¨old, you now need to explain before you 
talk about the fact that he is suddenly dead. There’s more 
referring back and forth in Google Docs.” Alice noted that 
Google Docs do not produce audio output unlike live coding 
where she “could actually hear what the other person is 
typing.” 
4.3.3 Importance of Support and Respect 
All learners suggested FiLOrk was more open-ended than 
other ensembles they perform in together. Mateo said, “In 
vocal ensemble, you’re learning parts. Everything’s very 
planned. Everything’s cohesive. In [FiLOrk] there are no 
sections, there’s not really a part system, and it’s free how 
you go about doing things.” Without assigned music or 
structure, learners had to reconcile contrasting aesthetics. 
For example, Olivia said, “each of us has our own style. 
Cindy likes her crazy rhythms and her evil plans. I usually 
stick to normal stuf, but I like a sprinkle of weirdness, a 
little surprise.” Learners could impose their style on others 
through editing or more often silencing other channels or 
the full ensemble. Donna remembered, “I’ve been known to 
silence Cindy, but that was mostly in the beginning when 
things were horrendous.” Learners believed that context 
was important for determining when to silence other chan-
nels. While Cindy felt “we weren’t as adventurous as maybe 
we could have been,”“nobody really came at each other like 
‘Oh, turn of your audio because it sucks.’ That was never 
really the thing.” Instead, learners asked permission when 
silencing and usually did so to manage classroom noise. 
Learners looked out for each other and ofered help, es-
pecially with technical difculties. In particular, multiple 
learners highlighted how Cindy repeatedly aided Alice, who 
was less adept at VoiceOver. Alice remembered “it was 
Cindy when we were trying to fx something that had to do 
with VoiceOver or my laptop,” while Donna commented, “If 
there’s a problem with VoiceOver, Cindy’s got it.” 
4.3.4 Collaboration Recommendations 
Mateo and Donna suggested we incorporate color and au-
dio feedback to indicate a text fragment’s source. Cindy 
requested options for VoiceOver to “not read collaborators’ 
actions on the document” but “announce who is editing.” To 
improve peer support in the classroom, Donna suggested we 
pair learners with similar assistive technologies rather than 
split them up: “If Alice has a problem, not only is she using 
VoiceOver, which I’m not fuent in, she’s also on a laptop, 
and I don’t know what to do with a laptop. Cindy and Al-
ice are using the same tech setup, so have the laptop people 
and the tablet people working together. It’s easier for Olivia 
to turn her screen on than it is for me and Mateo to read 
Cindy and Alice’s laptops.” Finally, Donna hoped that the 
ensemble will explore other strategies than speaking to each 
other during performance: Donna said, “I was lobbying for 
non-spoken signals. I would love it if nobody talks, there’s 
very little sound coming from humans, and all the sound is 
from computers.” 
5. DISCUSSION 
In general, FiLOrk met our initial technology, curriculum, 
and collaboration goals because all learners enjoyed their 
experience and successfully performed. Yet there is room 
for improvements. Below, we ofer technical design sugges-
tions to make the live coding ecosystem more accessible to 
BVI people, describe opportunities and challenges pertain-
ing to teaching live coding, and conclude with suggestions 
for making other live coding ensembles accessible and inclu-
sive for diverse learners. 
5.1 Tech Trade-offs For BVI Live Coders 
Despite technical challenges, text.management facilitated 
live coding in the classroom because it provided fexible 
use options: Visually impaired learners chose tablets to aid 
navigation while screen reader users accessed code through 
headphones or braille while listening to Tidal output in the 
room (§4.1.1). Other environments did not support learners 
at home because they performed poorly on tablets or were 
not optimized to support screen readers (§4.1.3). In gen-
eral, the live coding ecosystem requires installing software, 
but installation is not only complicated for novices, develop-
ment environments can be complex, or in the case of Atom, 
inaccessible2 . Browser-based solutions, in contrast, support 
a range of devices, but may limit developers’ ability to fne-
tune text-to-speech output, as shown by text.management’s 
strange text bugs (§4.1.2). While researchers have explored 
audio/tactile feedback for screen reader users in text-based 
composition [23], there are opportunities to further explore 
screen reader interactions in live-coding that balance aware-
ness and music. 
5.2 Syntax for Accessible Teaching 
Tidal is a concise syntax designed to be typed and edited 
quickly during performances [17]. Its concision simplifes 
navigation. Low vision learners saw most of their code 
2Atom does not support screen readers: https://github. 
com/atom/atom/issues/18660 
while zoomed in, while blind learners ft much of their code 
on their braille displays despite being limited to 40 cells 
(§4.1.1). As with prior research [23], our learners perceived 
inputting music with text to be sluggish compared to play-
ing on a MIDI keyboard. However, in this learning context, 
we feel that developing keyboard literacy is an added ben-
eft. 
An unforeseen consequence of Tidal’s concision is that 
learners felt it was hard to remember syntax and the pur-
pose of function arguments. For example, learners eventu-
ally comprehended Euclidean rhythms, but they they faced 
difculty understanding and remembering syntax, e.g. the 
order of three numbers and the type of separation. One 
solution may be to support optional labelled arguments, 
e.g. bd(3, 8, 2) could be written as bd(pulse:3, step:8, 
offset:2). Existing IDE and Tidal-specifc tools to aid re-
membering syntax and understanding behavior are visual, 
e.g. [19, 18]. Given that auto-completed enclosures were 
not detected by VoiceOver in browsers (§4.1.2), other vi-
sual cues, like code suggestions, are unlikely to be accessible 
without additional development. 
5.3 Collaboration Design Opportunities 
The most signifcant barrier experienced by VoiceOver users 
was the lack of feedback when others edited their code 
(§4.3.1). Solutions require nuance. If VoiceOver announced 
every change, the amount of feedback would be overwhelm-
ing, and participants felt they did not need to know oth-
ers’ precise actions. Still, as collaborative live coding per-
formances have shown, we believe there is signifcant cre-
ative and educational potential for BVI collaborators to 
make real-time changes to each others’ code. Live cod-
ing presents a unique environment to understand accessi-
ble collaboration given its strict timing requirements and 
loud environment. Other researchers have explored acces-
sible collaborative document editing [6] and software devel-
opment through tools such as CodeWalk, designed to sup-
port mixed-vision pair-programming with audio cues to con-
vey navigation/edit actions and unique commands to tether 
screen reader output to a leader [26]. To support collabora-
tive live coding, a combination of universal cues (e.g. when 
two people enter the same line) and distinct modes (e.g. solo 
editing vs. listening) may achieve the best results across 
circumstances. Design fndings may impact mixed-ability 
interactions in other synchronous environments. 
5.4 Aesthetic Differences as Opportunities 
We focused on designing software and teaching materials, 
but we discovered the importance of interpersonal relation-
ships in facilitating a successful class. In FiLOrk, learners 
knew each other and were aware of each other’s strengths 
and weaknesses. They felt comfortable ofering and asking 
for help (§4.3.3). However, they acknowledged that certain 
actions could appear disrespectful. We suggest that other 
high school live coding ensembles discuss ground rules up 
front and codify requirements for polite behavior, e.g. ask-
ing permission before silencing another channel. 
Furthermore, while our performance practices required 
that learners stay synchronized while editing similar code 
structures (e.g. changing the same efects, moving down one 
line, etc.), we intend to challenge learners to explore asym-
metric layouts and to treat aesthetic diferences as creative 
opportunities. For example Cindy’s distinct love of atonal, 
arrhythmic music may create tension (§4.3.3). We believe 
it suggests an improvisation in which Cindy experiments 
while others maintain stability, demonstrating to learners 
that their unique group dynamic may yield surprising out-
comes. 
6. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
While FiLOrk represents a diverse range of vision ability, 
musical skill, and technical literacy, it is small, and all fve 
learners knew each other. In the future, we intend to con-
tinue teaching Tidal concepts with tactile learning materi-
als and encourage learners to work on larger, more complex 
compositions. 
7. CONCLUSION 
We presented FiLOrk, a live coding ensemble made up of 
fve BVI learners. We successfully taught for twelve weeks 
using accessible course materials and text.management, a 
browser-based editor designed to work across platforms and 
assistive technologies. Learners explained how they utilized 
text.management and faced challenges with VoiceOver, how 
they enjoyed Tidal but felt challenged by syntax and cer-
tain rhythms, and fnally how they worked together within 
the document and classroom. Ahead, we believe there are 
opportunities to improve live coding accessibility and inclu-
sion for BVI learners through technological, curricular, and 
collaborative interventions.

We thank the FMDG School faculty and students for their 
support and insight. We also thank members of the NYU 
Ability Project and Vertically Integrated Projects, espe-
cially Stella Yu. 
9. ETHICAL STANDARDS 
This research is approved by New York University’s Insti-
tutional Review Board. All participants are minors who 
signed assent forms while their parents signed consent forms 
and were given ample time before, during, and after inter-
views to opt out of research. We shared forms in text, Mi-
crosoft Word, and PDF formats to ensure they could be ac-
cessed across assistive technology preferences. Participants 
were compensated $25 for signing up for interviews. 
To ensure the establishment of shared goals, the lead au-
thor has volunteered at The Filomen M. D’Agostino Green-
berg Music School for three years prior to this study. He 
has developed a relationship with the learners through many 
non-research activities including helping lead other ensem-
bles, creating braille and large print music, and assisting 
with performances. FiLOrk meets the needs and interests 
of multiple parties beyond our team. It originated out of 
conversations between FMDG Music School teachers who 
wanted an electronic music ensemble, learners who wanted 
more technology oferings, and members of our research 
team who practice live coding. Not only did participants 
elect to enroll in the frst semester of FiLOrk depicted in 
this paper, all fve chose to enroll in a second semester.
