ABSTRACT
Music technology can provide persons who experience phys-
ical and/or intellectual barriers using traditional musical
instruments with a unique access to active music making.
This applies particularly but not exclusively to the so-called
group of people with physical and/or mental disabilities. 1
This paper presents two Accessible Digital Musical Instru-
ments (ADMIs) that were speciﬁcally designed for the stu-
dents of a Special Educational Needs (SEN) school with a
focus on intellectual disabilities. WithSnoeSky, we present
an interactive installation in form of a starry sky that in-
tegrates into the ceiling of a Snoezel-Room.2 Here, users
can ’play’ with ’melodic constellations’ using a ﬂashlight .
SonicDive is an interactive installation that enables users
to explore a complex water soundscape through their move-
ment inside a ball pool. The underlying goal of both ADMIs
is the promotion of self-eﬃcacy experiences while stimulat-
ing the users’ relaxation and activation. This paper reports
on the design process involving the users and their environ-
ment. In addition, it describes some details of the technical
implementation of the ADMIs as well as ﬁrst indices for
their eﬀectiveness.

ability of low-cost sensors and computers facilitate the de-

tings, while at the same time promoting a gain in research
interest and publications [5, 19, 8]. After theDeclaration of
Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities , active music-making can be regarded as a
basic human right [5]. Obviously, this right presupposes the
availability of accessible instruments.
2. RELA TED WORK
Existing ADMIs implement a wide range of diﬀerent ap-
proaches. Digital musical instruments addressing speciﬁc
abilities of particular users or user groups include for ex-
ample touchless sensor instruments like theSoundbeam3
and the Globophone [11], video-based instruments like the
MotionComposer [4], breath-sensor-based instruments like
the Magic Flute 4 and tangible instruments like the Skoog5.
Many ADMIs provide interactive environments where users
individually or collectively invoke and control sonic and/or
musical events and processes, like for example Blobmusic
[11], Sound Forest [6] or the Sound=Space Opera [1].
In her comprehensive review of ADMIs, Frid [5] notices
that there are only few publications speciﬁcally addressing
user groups with intellectual disabilities, while most devel-
opments focus on people with physical disabilities. Further-
more, the majority of ADMIs present only bimodal feedback
and only 15% provide vibrotactile feedback even though
the latter can support the feeling of control and thus self-
eﬃcacy.
Especially in Germany, most publications addressing the
accessibility of digital musical interfaces mainly focus on th e
use of mobile devices [7, 13] what besides advantages like
universal availability also evokes critique [9].
3. CONTEXT AND MOTIV A TION
The ADMIs described in this article have been developed
for a German SEN school focusing on intellectual disabili-
ties. The project has been conducted in the framework of
a multidisciplinary design workshop with a group of eight
students enrolled in the Music Design program of the Col-
lege of Music in Trossingen and the Media Design program
of the Digital Media Faculty at Furtwangen University.6 On
the side of the SEN school, the project involved a group of
pupils as well as their music teacher and further teachers
who closely accompanied the pupils within the class struc-
ture of the school. This allowed the design process to take

into account diﬀerent points of view and create positive dy-
namics around the project among the actors of the school.
The project produced a set of ﬁve functional prototypes
two of which are described in this article. The described
prototypes have been selected for being permanently in-
stalled in the SEN school at the end of the project.
In the context of disabilities, accessibility generally refers
to overcoming disabling barriers that exclude people from
participation. What might be regarded as such a barrier
or as participation depends on the context, the involved
individuals and their objectives. [5, 12, 17] Accordingly,
weather a DMI is regarded as accessible or not depends
on the individual circumstances of the application. In a
broader sense, a musical instrument in general can be seen
as a barrier for everybody who has not spent a lot of time
practising an instrument. Thus, eliminating intellectual or
physical barriers to music making using digital technology
may provide accessibility to a much broader audience. On
the other hand, digital technology itself might be perceived
as a barrier, amongst others, due to economical constraints
or technical challenges regarding the setup and maintenance
of complex devices and applications [18]. Consequently, it
was important not only to include the pupils – as future
users – into the design process to be able understand their
interests, abilities, and needs, but also to include teachers
and further staﬀ to understand the possibilities and con-
straints of the school environment.
An important concept guiding the design process has been
the notion of self-eﬃcacy [3]. The concept is going back to
the psychologist Albert Bandura and basically describes the
belief of individuals to be able to have a positive impact on
their environment. Referring to the development of indi-
viduals in social environments, the concept easily applies to
and extends through music making as an actual social ac-
tivity which, as Christopher Small points out,“stand[s] as
a metaphor for, ideal relationships between person and per-
son, between individual and society, between humanity and
the natural world and even perhaps the supernatural world”
[15].
With our developments, we seek to provide opportunities
to extend the users’ experience of self-eﬃcacy – actually
and metaphorically. The developed environments allow the
users to invoke and control sound through everyday gestures
and movements.
This paper will provide a detailed and transparent de-
scription of the technology used, including the electric cir-
cuits and sound synthesis implemented in Pure Data and
Max. The corresponding patches are available for down-
load7.
4. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A TION
The design process of the two ADMIs described in this arti-
cle consisted of multiple iterations of prototyping and eval-
uation following the design principles outlined by Ward et
al. [18]. The project started with an observation phase
of one month, that allowed us to become acquainted with
the children – their abilities, needs, and interests – and the
teachers as well as the school premises. This ﬁrst period
of observation allowed for developing ﬁrst ideas which have
been developed into mockups setting up the ADMIs’ basic
functionalities as well as ﬁrst sketches of sound design over
the following weeks.
Especially in the early period, the design process was
guided by the following questions:
7SnoeSky is available at https://github.com/imui-org/
SnoeSky and SonicDive is available at https://github.
com/imui-org/SonicDive.
• How do the ADMIs ﬁt the children’s abilities?
• How do the ADMIs ﬁt the children’s interests and
preferences?
• How do the ADMIs integrate into the facilities and
the everyday-life at school?
Apart from these questions we have been particularly at-
tentive to the metaphoricity implied by the ADMIs’ setup
and the aﬀorded interactions. The goal was to create joyful
and poetic environments that allow for positive and inspir-
ing experiences. After a ﬁrst selection of the most promising
ideas based on sketches and mockups started a development
period of several month.
Figure 1: The Snoezel-Room
4.1 SnoeSky
The basic idea of theSnoeSky8 installation was to design
an ADMI that blends in the concept of the Snoezel-Room
(see ﬁgure 1) and also uses the technical elements available
herein. Since the concept of the room lies in relaxation and
multisensory stimulation it seemed to be adequate to ex-
tend the room with optional audiovisual elements such as
soothing sounds and gentle lights responding to slow inter-
actions.
Considering that the Snoezel-Room invites the children to
relax on the waterbed the emplacement of visual elements
on the ceiling was an obvious choice. This consequently
inspired the idea of basing the visual elements of the instal-
lation on star constellations. The ﬁnal prototype integrates
65 yellow light dots distributed over a black surface of 1.2 by
1.2 meter ﬁxed on the ceiling above the bed. The light dots
are realised through LEDs embedded into a black wooden
panel at the approximate positions of the principal stars
of eight constellations.9 One of eight note pitches on an
overtone scale is associated to each constellation. A slowly
decaying note is triggered each time a ﬂashlight is pointed
to the corresponding constellation and rendered through the
loudspeaker system of the Snoezel-Room. Due to the notes’
long release, slow melodies and chords can be played by
moving the beam of the ﬂashlight over the constellations.
8The name SnoeSky is a concatenation of ’snoezelen’and
’sky’. A short video of children using the installation is
available at https://vimeo.com/412368397.
9The constellations formed by the light dots are Bo¨otes
(or Herdsman), Cassiopeia, Cepheus, Corona Borealis (or
Northern Crown ), Cygnus (Swan), Draco (Dragon), Ursa
Major (Great Bear ), and Ursa Minor (Little Bear ).

The interactive audio synthesis of the installation (see ﬁg-
ure 2) implements a one-to-one parameter mapping in which
the decaying envelopes of each of the eight voices are trig-
gered through a photoresistor embedded into the wooden
panel in the center of each constellation. The sensitivity of
the photoresistors is adjusted to capture the beam of a small
ﬂashlight being held by a person lying on the bed below the
panel. Each note sound is synthesised by a noise oscillator
shaped into a pitched sound by a strongly resonating ﬁl-
ter. Controlled by an envelope generator with a relatively
short but smooth attack and a long release time, the emerg-
ing sound quality has a soft resonating timbre of ‘shining’
texture. This synthesis technique can be seen as a simple
model of a resonator that is excited by a stroke. Other than
repeatedly triggered sound samples, it results a lively sound
quality with a relaxing eﬀect that is well accepted by the
users.
Figure 2: Final installation of SnoeSky
To further enhance the relaxing character of the sound
design, the notes triggered by the ﬂashlight appear on the
background of a meditative sound ambience. A constantly
changing harmonic background is generated by two ran-
domly breathing sounds that are generated in a similar
way as the triggered notes, but with very slowly pulsing
envelopes. The background ambience is completed by a low
drone sound that particularly excites the subwoofer below
the waterbed.
The installation runs on a Bela device10. The Bela plat-
form has been chosen for the possibility to easily create a
standalone installation including sensor inputs and audio
output programmed trough the visual programming envi-
ronmentPure Data 11. The computation power of the de-
vice is suﬃcient for the simple polyphonic sound synthesis
required by the installation. However, some additional com-
ponents of the initial sound design prototype running on a
laptop had to be omitted due to the limited computation
power of the Bela device running the ﬁnal prototype.
To provide a direct feedback that supports the feeling of
actually creating the sound, we used a short attack, thus
providing an impulse combined with the illumination of the
LEDs. In the ﬁnal installation, the direct feedback is em-
phasised by the low frequencies output by the transducer
in the waterbed. When lying on the bed, the low frequen-
cies can be felt as vibrotactile stimulation. In an earlier
prototype, we tried to use frequencies in a very low fre-
quency range (20 - 80Hz). However, after testing, we found
that frequencies in the range from 100 to 200 Hz were more
pleasant as auditory as well as tactile sensation. Due to
CPU limitation we used three diﬀerent sine oscillators that
each are associated to the sound of multiple constellations.

Figure 3: A child testing SnoeSky
To create congruency between sound and light intensity,
the LEDs are driven through pulse width modulation con-
trolled by the sound intensity using an envelope follower.
Due to the limited current on the digital pins from Bela we
use an external 15V/0,8A stabilized DC power supply for
the LEDs. To close the circuit only when needed, a LR7843
transistor is combined with an optocoupler triggered by a
digital output signal from Bela. The lights are set up in
rows of 6 yellow LEDs each12, which are combined in se-
ries to form the constellation. If the number of LEDs of a
constellation is not a multiple of 6, the row is completed
with 120Ohm resistors replacing the missing LEDs (see ﬁg-
ure 4.1). The photoresistor is connected to an analog pin of
the Bela board through a standard voltage divider circuit.13

Aball pool is situated at the top ﬂoor of the school in
one corner of a larger space including diﬀerent areas con-
structed for play. Although it represents an opportunity
for the children to exercise free movement, the ball pool
has been used only very little. This situation inspired the
concept of an interactive interaction based on the metaphor
of swimming and diving, creating an immersive experience

where the physical sensation of the ball pool is augmented
by sound.
Using a camera sensing depth, the postures and move-
ments of a user playing in the ball pool control a complex
soundscape consisting of a generative ambience and inter-
active water sounds. Hereby, diﬀerent sound ambiences are
associated to motion below and above the water symbolized
by the balls as well as to particular movements like diving
into the pool or splashing water.
The users’ movement in the ball pool is measured using
a Kinect sensor mounted above the pool. The applications
runs on a Laptop programmed with Cycling ’74 Max14. The
image processing is based on the cv.jit package for Max
by Jean-Marc-Pelletier15 and the communication with the
Kinect is handled by the dp.kinect external by Dale Phur-
rough16.
The mapping of the motion data to the sound synthesis
distinguishes between the overall movement and the move-
ment in certain areas of the pool. The depth image is used
to distinguish motion above and below the surface of the
balls in the pool. Open computer vision is used to perform
a simple blob detection distinguishing smaller and larger
objects moving on the surface of the pool (see ﬁgure 5).
While smaller objects like a hand raised or a ball thrown
above the surface induce smaller sound events like splashes,
the detection of bigger objects like the users’ body is used
to distinguish between motion diving below and emerging
above the virtual waterline. The detection of motion in cer-
tain areas of the video is separated into two distinct modes.
In the ﬁrst mode, the video is divided in four equal squares.
The second mode consists of 100 equal squares. For move-
ment detection the diﬀerence between successive frames is
calculated and smoothed over time.
The corresponding sound design is composed by multi-
ple elements. The background ambience is generated by
a generative sound engine that plays back segments of a
piano chord sample, back and forth with constantly chang-
ing start and end positions. The synthesis of water sounds
of diﬀerent intensity is mapped to the overall amount of
motion. The engine cross-fades between three layers of dif-
ferent sounds corresponding to diﬀerent levels of intensity.
Each layer consists of a constantly changing sequence of
random samples associated to the same intensity level. To
create a realistic impression of moving water like, for ex-
ample, a wave that rises and slowly abates, the amount of
motion has to increase quickly and then slowly fade to zero.
The detection of motion above the surface and under water
is translated into the control of a lowpass ﬁlter. Underwater
sounds are characterised by reduced high frequencies. The
transition between above and under water is accompanied
by a corresponding sound of moving water.
After testing diﬀerent sounds and interactions with a group
of children, a ﬁnal version sound design was elaborated. In
this mapping, small movements in a certain area, with a
low overall amount of motion, trigger diﬀerent sonar like
sounds associated to the coarse grid (4 squares) and wind
chime like sounds associated to the ﬁner grid (100 squares).
Part of the generated sound is sent through an eﬀect chain
consisting of a long reverb, a lowpass ﬁlter, and a delay
line. When the overall amount of motion exceeds a certain
threshold each passing through the delayline is pitch shifted,
thus creating a downward motion in pitch and timbre.
Additionally, smaller objects exceeding a certain height
above the surface, like a ball thrown upwards, trigger sounds

of splashing water.
In the ﬁnal prototype we expanded the interaction with
a visual component (see ﬁgure 5) using an existing video
projector mounted above the ball pool.
4.3 Preliminary Evaluation
While our main focus was the development and design pro-
cess of the instruments, we also collected some data from in-
formal observations and discussions with the teachers. This
ﬁrst evaluation was accompanied by the same questions that
already guided the design process. The test groups were
formed by 5 to 10 children and not every iteration could be
tested with the same children and the same amount of time.
While the children’s cognitive abilities varied broadly, there
were no children with severe physical disabilities present.
How do the ADMIs ﬁt the children’s abilities?
On the one hand, we did not observe any barriers for the
children using the basic functions of the two ADMIs. Even
if the interaction of inducing sound and light through the
beam of a ﬂashlight does not correspond to any phenomena
in the real world, most children usingSnoeSky could intu-
itively understand the basic functioning of the installation
without needing any explanations. For the few exceptions,
we observed that the children explained to each other how
the interaction works. ForSonicDive, the children seemed
to directly understand the water metaphor. We observed
typical swimming movements like arm strokes orholding
one’s nose while diving and one child even took a header.
On the other hand, we obsevered technical barriers regard-
ing the teachers. One teacher usedSnoeSky without sound
due to a wrong adjustment of the ampliﬁer. The teacher
was astonished when we showed her the full functionality
during a test session.
How do the ADMIs ﬁt the children’s interests and pref-
erences?
During the short period of testing we observed that the
children were deeply focused on the exploration of the sonic
possibilities and seamed to enjoy the interaction. This im-
pression was also conﬁrmed by the teachers feedback, for ex-
ample by one teacher telling us how the children repeatedly
asked to use the installations. We observed some children
laying down or performing slow, dance-like movements in
front of the testing setup ofSnoeSky, while another child
was playign the instrument. One teacher even told us,
that a child usingSnoeSky normally never acts so calmly
and focused. Most children seemed to enjoy the explor-
ing of the sonic possibilities in the interaction withSonic-
Dive. Some children repeatedly played with the over-under-
water–impact while laughing out loudly. In most cases and
for both ADMIs, for most children the testing sessions of 5
to 10 minutes each seemed to be too short. The teachers
had to stop the children from exploring so that every child
got the chance to test. We observed some exceptions for
SonicDive. Especially the children with mild cognitive dis-
abilities got bored after some testings, asking for diﬀerent
videos and sounds.
Both installations seemed to be especially appealing to
the 3 children with autism spectrum syndrome. For exam-
ple in the second testing one of those children came directly
to us, took the ﬂashlight and sat down in front ofSnoeSky
without even waiting for any greetings or instructions.
With SonicDive we observed a broad variance in the
kinds of movements the children performed. Some per-
formed huge movements, while some mostly performed del-
icate movements investigating the aﬀordances of the new
environment. So we had to adapt the interaction possibili-

86
ties multiple times, to react to those smaller movements.
Even though the interaction design of SnoeSky is rather
constrained, during evaluation (see ﬁgure 3) we observed
that some children using the installation developed their
own playing techniques. For example, the children changed
the focus of the ﬂashlight playing several notes at once,
retriggered the same ones in diﬀerent tempi, alternated be-
tween two notes in diﬀerent tempi (tremolo) and created
melodies or soundscapes of diﬀerent densities. Altogether
the children extensively explored the instrument in extended
sessions lasting up to 20 minutes. Most of the sessions would
have continued if they were not interrupted by the teachers.
Considering, that too much sensory feedback might be
overwhelming for certain users [5], we integrated the pos-
sibility to directly turn oﬀ the vibrotactile feedback at the
sound system. Unfortunately, this way most users are not
able to choose for themselves if they want to turn it on or
oﬀ.
How do the ADMIs integrate into the facilities and the
everyday-life at school?
The current prototype ofSnoeSky has been permanently
installed in the school, so it can be tested and evaluated
over a longer period of time. It is easy to activate using a
switch that turns on Bela, with the Pure Data Patch loading
automatically. In addition, we designed a pictured step by
step instruction on how to use the installation. Some teach-
ers already used the ADMI outside of the testing setting.
Furthermore, the interaction through the ﬂashlight makes
that the users’ physical interaction with the installation is
limited to a strict minimum, which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes
its maintenance.SonicDive has not yet been permanently
installed.
The costs for the material necessary to build SnoeSky add
up to about 350 Euros in total. The installation has to be
mounted on the ceiling, but is completely standalone and
perfectly integrated in the space without requiring any par-
ticular attention and without interfering with any activity.
BuildingSonicDive only implies costs of 50 Euros for the
Kinect sensor and the corresponding Max external. How-
ever, the installation requires a Windows-based computer
to run the software that has to be integrated into the in-
stallation or setup and connected each time the installation
is used. On the other hand, the SonicDive installation can
be setup in a few minutes at any ball pool.
5. DISCUSSION
The ADMIs described above follow two very diﬀering ap-
proaches to ADMI design. WhileSnoeSky appears as a
conventional tonal musical instrument that allows for play-
ing melodies and chords through an interaction accessible
to a large range of users,SonicDive can be more easily clas-
siﬁed as an interactive sound installation. In summary, the
ﬁrst evaluation of both ADMIs led to positive feedback from
both pupils and teachers, with some exceptions forSonic-
Dive.
The users mostly seemed to enjoy the direct and intu-
itive relationship between motion and sound. While the
observed creative exploration ofSnoeSky conﬁrms Rokeby’s
statement that “constraints provide a frame of reference, a
context, within which interaction can be perceived” [14], the
constraints of SonicDive led to some children being bored.
One solution to this problem would be to add more vari-
ance to the sounds or even let the children switch between
diﬀerentworlds, keeping in mind that more variance might
be overwhelming to other children. In general, the question
of long-term engagement has to be evaluated over a longer
period of time.
Furthermore the observation of teachers using SnoeSky
shows that it is very important to design the ADMIs self-
contained and to provide a detailed and easy to use instruc-
tion.
The data collected can only give a ﬁrst impression and
has to be interpreted carefully. To validate the observa-
tions further and more structured evaluations have to be
conducted, most importantly with constant groups of chil-
dren over a longer period of time. Additionally, the ob-
servations and their interpretations should be validated by
interviewing the children and their teachers.
Especially during the testing of SonicDive, the observed
pleasure of the children with severe cognitive disabilities
might be partly explained by the promotion of self-eﬃcacy
experiences.
Since it seems to be a general problem in SEN school set-
tings to get steady access to the same children and follow a
schedule, it might be a good idea to also include the teach-
ers in the evaluation process and have them collect data as
well. Furthermore the observation time should be adapted
to the individual needs of the children. It might also be
a good idea to observe the children in individual settings.
The teachers tend to give instructions to the children that
might disrupt their individual way of exploring.
Although, we did not observe any barriers while the chil-
dren were using the ADMIs, we want to stress that intellec-
tual barriers are hard to uncover. While physical barriers
are mostly visible, intellectual barriers are highly subjective.
To uncover them one needs to know the individual person
and be able to interpret her or his behaviour or statements.
Mainly SonicDive might not be accessible to users with
severe physical disabilities, but both ADMIs yet have to be
tested with this user group.
6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have described the design and implementation of two
ADMIs developed during a one-year workshop in collabo-
ration with a SEN school. While one installation has been
successfully setup in the school, the other will hopefully fol-
low soon. The ﬁnal prototypes have been well received by
pupils of the school and the ﬁnal evaluations seem to con-
ﬁrm the design choices made.
Nevertheless, a few weaknesses could already be identi-
ﬁed which call for future improvements. For SonicDive we
would like to ﬁnd a solution to provide better accessibility
to users with severe physical disabilities which would allow
for setting up the installation in diﬀerent SEN schools as
already planned. In general, we would like to test – and
possibly adapt – the installation with larger ranges of users
of diﬀerent ages and abilities.
Since the sound and interaction design of SnoeSky is rather
limited we would like to integrate further controls to vary
scales and timbre from one session to another. Integrating
parameter automation would allow the sound to evolve over
time especially when single constellations are illuminated
for a longer period of time or repeatedly. Future extensions
ofSnoeSky could integrate the possibility to repeat note se-
quences played by the user in a loop. This loop-function is
already implemented but disabled in the current prototype
to simplify the interaction.
The permanent implementation of the installations at the
school will allow for evaluating them over a longer period of
time. For this purpose, the teachers are asked to collect ob-
servations in a diary and regularly make photos of sessions
with the children.
