ABSTRACT
This article presents two case studies featuring DMIs, the T-
Stick and the Karlax, aiming to showcase various technical
and performance obstacles encountered in existing and new
compositions for novel instruments. The analysis covers dif-
ferent stages of a performance, including preparatory pro-
cesses, practice sessions, and the actual performance, high-
lighting challenges faced and solutions implemented. The
support obtained through communicating with composers is
emphasized. Additionally, the discussion delves into techni-
cal considerations, score interpretations, and playing tech-
niques specific to the two DMIs, contributing to a deeper
understanding of performance practice. These case studies
can inspire DMI designers when creating their instruments
so that barriers to performance can be eliminated. Further-
more, the findings underscore the necessity for composers to
create documentation with comprehensive information, fa-
cilitating a thorough understanding for performers of both
the instrument’s manipulations and their artistic vision.

1. INTRODUCTION
Since the mid-80s, a large number of DMIs have emerged
[18]. Although musicians like Laetitia Sonami (The Lady
Glove), Michel Waisvisz (The Hands), Andy Schloss (The
Radio Drum), and Mark Goldstein (The Buchla Lightning
II and The Marimba Lumina), among others, have mastered
these instruments through extensive use, many new DMIs
are often abandoned after a few performances. Identified
reasons include a lack of dedicated instrumental technique,
the need for a new adapted notation, and the absence of an
established repertoire [13].
To address this longevity issue, various approaches have
been taken. Some offer recommendations for designing DMIs
[19], while other efforts focus on developing performance
techniques and notation systems [21, 15] or propose peda-
gogical frameworks for learning and long-term practice with
DMIs [8, 4, 2, 14]. Additionally, community-building initia-
tives have been proposed [5, 16]. In this paper, we examine
this issue from the perspective of performers.
For acoustic instrument pieces, it is generally considered
that a performer only requires access to the instrument and
a score to practice and render the music in concert. How-
ever, the scenario for DMIs is often far more intricate. De-
veloping a repertoire entails more than just a score detailing
what and how to play. Even with instruments and scores
at hand, numerous hurdles must be navigated before pre-
senting a DMI piece. In other words, what information and
resources are needed for a performer to be able to play a
DMI piece?
This paper focuses on two case studies on the performance
of DMIs, highlighting technical issues and performance chal-
lenges. The first describes the steps needed to perform an
existing piece for solo T-Stick. The second study describes
the techniques used by a performer learning to perform a
new piece composed for solo Karlax.
The T-Stick and Karlax were selected not only for their
availability but also for their extended repertoire and active
community of users [17, 9, 21, 15].
We hypothesize that executing established DMI reper-
toire might in many cases necessitate the involvement of
not only the performer but also the composer and the in-
strument designer. Their roles are crucial in offering in-
sights into the functionality of the hardware and software,
including interface firmware, mapping, and sound synthesis
choices. The documentation supplementing a score should
provide the performer with information on the DMI, its
setup and its interaction with the various software needed
to perform the piece [1, 7].
2. T-STICK CASE STUDY
In this section, we describe the steps needed to perform
Antoine Goudreau’s Les multiples usages du mot “geste”,
a piece for solo T-Stick composed and premiered in 2021.
Although the piece was not actually performed at the end
of the study, a performance would have been possible.
2.1 Background
2.1.1 Interface Description
The T-Stick is a family of hand-held cylindrical gestural
controllers developed at the Input Devices and Music Inter-
action Laboratory (IDMIL) [12]. The most prevalent ver-
sion available nowadays at IDMIL is the Sopranino T-Stick.
It contains various sensors that allow for touching, shaking,
and squeezing: one inertial measurement unit inside the
tube, with 16 capacitive strips on one side, and one force
sensing resistor (FSR) on the other side (see Figure 1). The
interface sports a firmware that not only exposes the raw
sensor data but also computes gestural descriptors such as
“jab” or “shake” [17].
Since its creation, efforts have been made to establish a
community of performers and composers as well as develop
the repertoire for the instrument [6], leading to a catalog of
20+ compositions for solo T-Stick or various instrumenta-
tion [17].

2.1.2 Context of the Composition
Antoine Goudreau’s Les multiples usages du mot “geste”is
a solo Sopranino T-Stick piece with a duration of approx-
imately 5 minutes. It marked Goudreau ’s debut compo-
sition for the T-Stick. The piece explores various ways in
which the T-Stick can interact with the parameters of a
granular synthesizer. The original performer was not the
composer but a classically trained jazz pianist with lim-
ited technological knowledge. The performer contributed
sound material through a piano improvisation, and an ex-
cerpt from the recording was used as the granulation sound
file.
A video recording of the unique performance is available
online1 and served as a reference for rehearsal, both for bet-
ter understanding instrument manipulations and checking
that the sound produced matched the timbre originally de-
fined by the composer.

This case study focuses on assessing the capability of a
musician already familiar with the T-Stick and computer
music software (the first author) to act as the second per-
former of a piece for solo T-Stick.
2.2 Preparatory Stage
2.2.1 Technical Setup
As DMIs aren’t self-contained instruments, several techni-
cal setup stages are necessary to make them functional. For
this piece, the required hardware includes a T-Stick, a com-
puter, and an audio interface for stereo output to a pair
of loudspeakers. Furthermore, a WiFi network must be set
up to allow communication between the interface and the
computer.
For his composition, the composer based his approach of
the T-Stick on incorporating multiple mapping layers (see
Figure 4). Initially, OSC data transmitted from the T-Stick
is routed to a Max patch, where the composer devised the
first layer of mapping, selecting T-Stick data that suited his
requirements to capture the performer’s gestures. For ex-
ample, the tilt value of the interface was determined based
on the impact of gravity on the data from the accelerome-
ters.

Subsequently, the data is transmitted to Libmapper, a
software engineered for rapid and dynamic experimentation
during the mapping phase of instrument design 2 [11]. This
mapping layer is processed in Webmapper [22], a browser-
based graphical user interface (GUI) designed for Libmap-
per. This tool facilitates the visualization and manipula-
tion of mappings within the context of DMI design. The
resulting signal controls from the Libmapper layer are then
directed to a second Max patch, where they are mapped to
the IRCAM’s Max Sound Box granulation engine3. Several
objects from the Digital Orchestra Toolbox 4 [10] are used
to process control signals.
Figure 4: Mapping Layers: T-Stick data is initially sent
to a Max patch for initial mapping, with the bulk of map-
ping done in Webmapper before being sent to a second Max
patch for sound production.
Due to this mapping architecture, the computer requires
installing numerous software packages and libraries. The
complete list can be found in Table 1.
2.2.2 Challenges during Technical Setup
The first obstacle encountered in the preparatory phase re-
volved around the obsolete Libmapper library for Max. The
Max objects included in the initial 2021 patches proved in-
compatible with the 2023 release of the library, requiring
an upgrade to their most recent versions to guarantee the
proper functioning of both the patch transmitting data to
Libmapper and the one receiving Libmapper’s output.
Furthermore, the issue of Libmapper obsolescence also
impacted the mapping layer conducted in Webmapper. Al-
though mapping equations in Webmapper can be saved in a
JSON file, the format of the provided JSON file was incom-
patible with the current software version. With Libmap-
per’s mapping layer consisting of only 12 parameter asso-
ciations and the associated equations being relatively sim-
ple—generally involving linear scaling—the most straight-
forward solution was to manually recreate the mapping layer
in Webmapper (see Figure 5).
The specific version of the T-Stick used by Goudreau in
2021 is unidentified. An examination of the Max patches
revealed several disparities in hardware and firmware com-
pared to T-Sticks available in 2023. Notably, the origi-
nal Max patches relied on data from a piezoelectric sensor,
which was removed from the latest version of the interface

vided in Goudreau’s documentation.
[20]. In Goudreau’s piece, the piezoelectric sensor was em-
ployed to trigger significant sonic events (see 2.3.1). A “jab”
gesture extracted from the interface’s firmware was selected
as an alternative to replicate this functionality, as the piezo
sensor was unavailable in the current interface.
2.2.3 Score Reading
The accompanying documentation for the graphical score
provides an explanation of its visual elements. The score
serves a dual function: certain graphical elements visually
represent the intended sound, while others prescribe specific
actions or manipulations for the performer. It features a
single-line staff, acting as a reference line for musical events
within the stereophonic space. The labels G and D denote
the left and right audio channels, respectively.
Figure 6: The score notation consists of graphical elements
arranged on a single-line staff with temporal references. G
and D indicate panning to the left and right audio channels,
respectively.
Elements of the score were crafted specifically for the
composition, covering aspects such as grain notation, T-
Stick orientation, hand placement on the T-Stick, hand
opening and closing, tapping, and shaking. The grain nota-
tion indicates not only the grains’ left or right position and
volume but also their density from individually perceivable
grains to a continuous texture and the expected sound vol-
ume.
2.3 Challenges during Practice
2.3.1 Playing Techniques
While the score specifies whether the hands should be open
or closed on the instrument, it provides no instruction on
how to hold it. Insights from the original performance video
and discussions with the composer were essential in under-
standing hand positioning. The performer should maintain
an approximately horizontal hold, resting the instrument on
their right thumb and left palm, as depicted in Figure 2.
(a) Grain density notation
 (b) Shaking instruction
Figure 7: Examples of graphical score elements: figure 7a
represents the desired sound texture (discernible grains or
continuous), and Figure 7b depicts a shaking manipulation.
The T-Stick is typically positioned horizontally as in-
structed on the score. However, it does not specify whether
the FSR side or the side of the capacitive strips should face
upward. Unfortunately, the accompanying video does not
provide any clarification on this matter. However, after con-
sulting with the composer, it was clarified that the T-Stick
should be held with the FSR side facing upward.
The most significant insight gleaned from discussions with
the composer clarified the temporal progression of the piece.
While Goudreau’s documentation states that grains are gen-
erated by squeezing the T-Stick’s body, the graphical score
does not aim for timing precision. Instead, the composer
insisted that the timing of the piece could be interpreted
loosely. The lines depicted on the score, as shown in Fig-
ure 7a, do not represent each grain to be produced; instead,
they provide a general indication of whether the temporal
gap between the grains should be tight or loose.
Similarly, considering the instrument’s lack of indepen-
dent volume control, the performer will deduce that while
the score indicates when the produced sound should be
louder (as indicated by the height of the lines on the staff),
achieving a louder sound requires triggering a larger quan-
tity of grains.
Single louder grain or short cluster of louder grains is
achieved by slightly tapping the middle section of the in-
strument on the side of the capacitive strips (see Figure 8).
There is no specific recommendation about the manipula-
tion required to achieve this result. The composer indicated
that the gesture is typically performed using the little finger
on the left hand. This provides a better understanding of
the video. Besides, once the handling of the T-Stick is un-
derstood, this gesture can be mastered with little practice.
Figure 8: Middle tapping. Longer and thicker vertical lines
signify generating a short cluster of louder grains by tapping
the middle section of the interface.
As outlined in section 2.2.2, the absence of a piezoelec-
tric sensor in the T-Stick used for the case study led to the
adoption of a jab gesture. This adjustment necessitated a
change in playing technique whereby the performer thrusts
the T-Stick forward instead of striking it forcefully with one
hand. The intended outcome is to trigger a significant re-
verberation, thereby amplifying and sustaining the sound
of the grains being played. In the score, this climactic mo-
ment occurs twice, and the duration of the reverberation
effect is extended by continuously shaking the instrument
(see Figure 9).
Figure 9: Strike gesture. In the original performance, strik-
ing one end of the T-Stick triggered a reverberation effect.
The resonance is prolonged by shaking.
Once proficiency in the “jab” technique was attained, it
was easy to follow with a shaking since both gestures could
be executed without releasing one hand.
2.3.2 Instrument Adjustments
The composer stressed the crucial role of reverberation in
his piece, as it enables the resonance of short events to be
prolonged or even “frozen” in time. During practice, it was
observed that the shaking gesture resulted in excessive re-
verberation beyond the intended effect. This discrepancy is
likely due to inconsistencies in the shake calculation within
the T-Stick firmware, which has been updated since the
2021 version of the instrument. Consequently, the mapping
equation associated with this function was adjusted to re-
store the reverberation to the intended level.
Similarly, as hand pressure influences the generation of
grains, the mapping between FSR values and grain density
needed to be re-scaled to achieve the density specified in
the score. Notably, the composer stressed the importance
of maintaining the pressure applied on the FSR within a
comfortable range for the performer throughout the piece.
The current version of the T-Stick also includes a modi-
fied calculation of the interface’s orientation angles in space
(yaw, pitch, roll). This calculation is unreliable in the 2023
version of the firmware, so it is impossible to say if the re-
sults are similar to what Goudreau experienced two years
prior. These angles are linked to the position in the sound
file where the grains will be extracted. Nevertheless, af-
ter listening to the sounds produced by our instrument re-
construction, the composer judged that they were similar
enough to the original intended sounds. The similarity of
the sound material (piano sounds) and the short length of
the grains made that the position in the sound file had little
influence.
2.4 Readiness for a performance
The activities described in the previous sections lasted about
six weeks. Although the piece was not performed in con-
cert, the efforts undertaken during this case study enable an
evaluation of the level of preparedness achieved for future
performance.
Throughout the case study, there were several discus-
sions with Goudreau, debating the qualities of the produced
sounds and allowing for a deeper understanding of the com-
poser’s aesthetic intentions.
The composer’s approval of patch modifications, includ-
ing introducing the “jab” gesture, and a thorough under-
standing of his artistic intentions were pivotal in interpret-
ing the score effectively. Moreover, ensuring the instrument
was comfortable to hold and play was essential for the per-
former’s ease and performance quality. The “reconstructed”
DMI was deemed sufficiently reliable for performance.
Ultimately, the composer agreed that the piece could be
played. The only remaining task would have been to com-
plete a recommended one-month practice period. A concert
performance would then be an achievable goal.
3. KARLAX CASE STUDY
This case study discusses the steps taken by a musician (the
second author, a pianist and composer) to perform a new
piece for solo Karlax.
3.1 Background
3.1.1 Interface Description
The Karlax5 is a gestural controller shaped like a clarinet or
soprano saxophone that aroused substantial interest among
composers since its inception in 2010 and continues to be
commonly used in solo and group performances. Various
sensors are integrated into the device: ten continuous keys,
eight velocity pistons, a rotary axis with bends, an inertial
measurement unit, and multiple switches (see Figure 10).
It also features a rotary axis with bends at each end, en-
abling the musician to twist the controller’s axis. Like many
musical interfaces that output sensor data without having a
pre-defined sound, the Karlax is defined solely by its control
characteristics, i.e., its gestural affordances, instead of by a
given sonic palette [9].

main sensors, including ten continuous keys, eight velocity
pistons, a rotary axis, and an embedded inertial measure-
ment unit. Credits: DA FACT.
3.1.2 Context of the Composition
Instrumental Interaction IV, subtitled 4 studies for Karlax
solo, was composed by Benjamin Lavastre in 2023. It is part
of a series of compositions called Instrumental Interaction,
which, as its name suggests, is dedicated to exploring the
interaction strategies between the Karlax and acoustic in-
struments. This solo Karlax piece, the fourth of the series,
encompasses four distinct movements with a total duration
of approximately 7 minutes, specifically exploring the dual
identity of the Karlax as both a gestural controller and an
instrument.
The major research question in this case study is how to
approach a newly composed piece for Karlax as a novice
DMI performer, composer, and pianist with intermediate
knowledge of music technology.
Although Instrumental Interaction IVwas premiered by
the second author, an improvisational excerpt by the com-
poser using the same sound synthesis was available online
5http://www.dafact.com/
and was a reference for the practice progression. The re-
hearsal phase available to the performer was less than a
month, and the final recording session was scheduled for
November 30, 2023, at the Performance Research Labora-
tory (PeRL), Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music
Media and Technology (CIRMMT).
3.2 Prepatory Stage
3.2.1 Technical Preparation
Before starting to practice a new DMI piece, having an ac-
curate technical setup is essential. In this case study, the
composer was available to meet in person and assist with
clarifying the necessary steps for preparing both hardware
and software. To perform Instrumental Interaction IV, a
Karlax with a MIDI receiver, an audio interface, and a
computer running Max/MSP (version 8 or later) were re-
quired. Additionally, a configuration of loudspeakers with
adjustable spatialization was necessary. The Max patch ne-
cessitates specific libraries and VSTs, including the Digital
Orchestra Toolbox, CNMAT-Externals, GRMPitchAccum,
and GRMReson.
3.2.2 Score Reading
In this piece, the composer chooses a hybrid approach com-
bining prescriptive (use of keys, pistons, axis, and incli-
nation indications) and descriptive (main pitches in sound
synthesis) notation. A four-part score is utilized to notate
gestures and the music: movements, axis and bends, pis-
tons and keys, and electronic content, as shown in Figure
11. The top part of the score includes various symbols to
represent specific movements. Axis rotation is depicted on
a three-line staff with a thick line to indicate the axis’s ori-
entation: proximity to the top line suggests an open axis
(wrists turned outwards), whereas closeness to the bottom
line suggests a closed axis (wrists turned inwards). For the
staves labelled Karlax and Electronics, pistons and keys are
denoted using abbreviations and numbers, and a descrip-
tive part for the electronic content (main pitches) is also
included. For instance, in the first measure of Figure 11,
P3 represents pressing piston 3 with a resulting sound of
boobam in E flat.
Figure 11: Score excerpt of Instrumental Interaction IV,
showing the full notation consisting of four parts: movement
representation in symbols, axis rotation, Karlax keys and
pistons with their corresponding electronic content, and a
complementary staff for electronics.
In terms of instructions for movements, the composer uses
five types of symbols to indicate the main movements in
the piece: transitional positions, circular movements, wavy
movements, and gestures of lifting and thrusting, as seen
in Figure 12. To indicate Karlax’s inclination during tran-
sitions, the composer adopts the symbol of concentric cir-
cles developed in a notation system by Mays and Faber[15],
where the speed of the transitions is represented by dotted
lines (the shorter the dotted lines, the faster the transition).
Figure 12: Five types of gestures used in Instrumental In-
teraction IV and their corresponding symbols.
For interpreting a precisely notated score like Instrumen-
tal Interaction IV, it is advisable to establish a systematic
reading and practicing process beforehand. The performer
in this case study recommends the following approach to
the score: begin with the Karlax stave to familiarize your-
self with the pistons and keys. Then, proceed to the axis
and movement staves to understand the gestures required.
Finally, the electronic description must be examined to con-
firm and adjust the produced sounds.
3.3 Challenges During Practice
The four movements have distinctive durations and charac-
teristics:
• Study I, the longest movement in the piece, spans ap-
proximately 3 minutes and 35 seconds with a tempo
of 60-66 bpm. It features a combination of pistons
and keys (both discrete and continuous). The sam-
ples in the electronics include several kinds of percus-
sive sounds, such as boobams, roto-toms, and bongos,
while white noise is assigned to continuous keys.
• Study II lasts about 1 minute and 5 seconds with a
tempo of 50 bpm. This movement exclusively uti-
lizes pistons, characterized by continuous gestures and
calm musical imagery. The electronic content com-
prises bowed crotales, rain sticks, and crackling sounds.
• In Study III, the duration is approximately 2 min-
utes and 10 seconds with a tempo of 72 bpm. This
movement is unique in its exclusive use of continu-
ous keys combined with FM synthesis. The composer
specifies that the gestures in this movement should be
performed steadily and mechanically.
• The last movement, Study IV, is the shortest of all,
lasting approximately 52 seconds. It mainly focuses
on discrete keys, and the electronic components in-
clude nearly every sample used in the first three move-
ments, including FM synthesis, boobams, roto-toms,
rain sticks, and bowed crotales.
In the following sections, three excerpts extracted from
movements I, III, and IV will be discussed. These excerpts
highlight performance techniques such as playing pistons
with thrusts in complex rhythms, applying staccato on con-
tinuous keys for short timbre control, and adjusting finger-
ings and hand-holding positions.
3.3.1 Excerpt 1
The first excerpt presents a challenge regarding its complex
rhythms on pistons with thrusts, as seen in measure 37 of
the first movement (see Figure 13). While these rhythms
might be more easily reproduced on an acoustic instrument
like a piano, they pose challenges when performed on a Kar-
lax. The indications P3TC and P3TL mean thrusting to-
wards the center and the left bottom while holding piston
3 down. However, the corresponding sounds can only be
triggered when the inclination values are within the valid
range.
Figure 13: Score of measures 36-37 in the first movement,
illustrating an example of complex rhythms on pistons with
thrusts.
When playing the Karlax, a short time is needed to re-
turn to the initial sensing state after a certain amount of
activity. This results in latency that is difficult to avoid,
mainly due to the need for rapid switches between standard
piston pressing and thrusting movements. Most thrusts in
this excerpt are directed toward the top center ( P7T, P8T,
P3TC ), which are easier to control than thrusts toward the
two sides ( TL and TR), and this somewhat mitigates the
problem. One potential solution is to maintain steadiness
before each thrust, though this approach primarily applies
to slower phrases. Another potential solution is to slow
down the tempo during practice, similar to practicing with
an acoustic instrument, and attempt to establish muscle
memory for the precise inclination of each thrust.
3.3.2 Excerpt 2
The most challenging aspect of the second excerpt, drawn
from the third movement, is maintaining steady, regular
rhythms while simultaneously controlling the timbre on con-
tinuous keys. In this movement, executing regular FM syn-
thesis staccatos becomes unstable when playing continu-
ous keys. With short staccatos, latency can easily disrupt
the performer’s rhythm consistency due to delayed auditory
feedback. Additionally, as indicated in measure 7, Figure
14, achieving the exact 0.2 value for axis rotation poses a
significant challenge.
Figure 14: Score of measures 5-7 in the third movement,
illustrating how continuous keys produce subtle timbral
changes while maintaining a strictly steady rhythm.
After consultation with the composer, he clarified the ex-
pected sounds and proposed an alternative approach: rather
than aiming for a specific degree of rotation, the performer
should adjust the axis towards more modulated sounds based
on their auditory perception. This solution grants the per-
former greater flexibility to modify the gesture in response
to auditory feedback. For parts like excerpt 2, understand-
ing the signal processing strategies used in the patch would
help achieve the desired sound outcome.
3.3.3 Excerpt 3
A challenging aspect of the fourth movement, as depicted
in Figure 15, involves executing fast phrases with discrete
keys. To accurately reproduce the rhythms and dynamics
as indicated in the score, a performer, especially those with
relatively small hands, might need to consider making ad-
justments to how they hold the Karlax. In this case study,
the performer’s right hand was adjusted to be positioned
more towards the front than the originally indicated po-
sition. Additionally, reordering the fingering for complex
passages would help achieve precise rhythms. These ad-
justments allow for the production of clean sounds from
the keys without inadvertently simultaneously activating
the pistons.
Figure 15: Score of measures 1-3 in the fourth movement,
illustrating the challenge of performing fast phrases on dis-
crete keys. When the letter “D” follows a key number (e.g.
K1D in the second measure), it indicates that the composer
has changed this key from continuous to discrete.
3.4 Issues Encountered in Performance
One significant challenge in DMI performance is that the
final result often depends on the specific conditions of the
performance venue, requiring time for troubleshooting and
sensor value adjustments. During the recording session of
Instrumental Interaction IV, the time allocated for technical
setup was minimal, leading to difficulties in making the 36-
channel surround system function properly. This issue sig-
nificantly impacted the spatialization effect on performance.
Recording equipment was also an issue; the unavailability
of an ideal multichannel microphone led to an alternative
setup to capture sound trajectories. The final recording is
a studio mix combining two sources: clean soundsrecorded
binaurally within the patch using the Spat object in Max
[3], and a stereo recording from a Sony PCM-D100 placed
at the sweet spot inside the room (see Figure 16).
Another challenge the performer encountered during the
performance was managing unexpected sounds, which mainly
occurred during passages involving a lot of thrusts with pis-
tons. Despite the potential instability and insensitivity of

the inclinometer, controlling a thrust associated with a live-
synthesized sound, for example, via GRMReson, proved
particularly difficult. Achieving the ideal volume balance
required meticulous gesture control and simultaneously re-
scaling the parameters in the Max patch. These issues could
potentially be alleviated with additional time for in-hall set-
up and rehearsals, as well as revisions to the patch.
4. DISCUSSION
The two studies presented offer valuable insights into the
complexities of DMI performance, emphasizing the impor-
tance of composers’ involvement in technical and artistic
preparation. The final results of the two case studies, per-
formance readiness for the T-Stick and a full-fledged per-
formance of the Karlax piece6, indicate that the presence of
the composer (and sometimes the interface designer) during
the initial technical preparation stage is beneficial. This is
particularly true for older pieces where issues of interface
changes and software obsolescence may arise. Newer com-
positions involving more stable interfaces like the Karlax,
still benefit from the composer’s guidance. Given the tech-
nical complexity involved in both cases, having a performer
with a technical background would facilitate the setup pro-
cess.
Score and notation systems differed considerably between
the two studies, reflecting the diverse nature of DMIs and
composers’ intentions. The T-Stick piece, for which the
notation was specifically developed, embraced a flexible ap-
proach, granting performers a degree of interpretative free-
dom. In contrast, the Karlax study employed a highly de-
tailed notation system that left little room for interpreta-
tion. This contrast underscores how the choice of notation
system is influenced by the specific DMI and compositional
objectives, leading to different situations: a Karlax notation
system has been primarily established [15], while notation
for T-Stick may vary depending on each piece.
The examination of performing techniques across the two
case studies further illustrates the adaptive nature of DMI
performance. For both DMIs, especially the T-Stick, the
development of playing techniques forms an integral part of
the composition process, differing from traditional acous-
tic instruments. This requires adaptations due to obsoles-
cence and evolving interfaces as well. However, the Karlax
partially allows for applying traditional acoustic instrument
techniques, such as those involving keys and pistons found
in saxophones or pianos, to its performance. The required

practice time varies depending on the unique features of
each piece and the specific DMI involved. Nevertheless, in
both case studies, the input of composers regarding score
interpretation and artistic expression proved beneficial.
5. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presented some of the multifaceted challenges
performers face when learning and performing compositions
for DMIs. These challenges extend beyond acquiring the
interface and the score, encompassing technological, techni-
cal, and artistic aspects inherent to these instruments. Both
case studies underscored the importance of the composers
in helping performers understand the piece. However, as
the availability of composers cannot be guaranteed, it be-
comes essential for them to devise means to provide com-
prehensive documentation to performers covering both the
instrument’s manipulations and their artistic vision.
The T-Stick study also shed light on how changes in the
instrument can potentially impact the piece’s playability.
Such observations should inspire DMI designers to achieve
stability in their instruments’ hardware and software com-
ponents. This emphasis on stability will contribute to the
instruments’ longevity and facilitate wider adoption.
Despite the obstacles encountered during the preparatory
phase, the rehearsals, and the final performance, the two
studies ultimately ended up with positive outcomes. These
experiences enabled performers to practice DMI playing
techniques. Given the range of DMIs available, conduct-
ing multiple similar case studies could provide further in-
sights into the implications of DMI performance practice,
contribute to its development, and ultimately enhance the
longevity of these instruments.
