ABSTRACT
Mobile devices constitute a generic platform to make stan-
dalone musical instruments for live performance. However,
they were not designed for such use and have multiple lim-
itations when compared to other types of instruments.
We introduce a framework to quickly design and proto-
type passive mobile device augmentations to leverage exist-
ing features of the device for the end goal of mobile musical
instruments.
An extended list of examples is provided and the results
of a workshop, organized partly to evaluate our framework,
are provided.

1. INTRODUCTION
Mobile devices (smart-phones, tablets, etc.) have been used
as musical instruments for the past ten years both in the
industry (e.g., GarageBand1 for iPad, Smule’s apps, 2 mo-
Forte’s GeoShred,3 etc.) and in the academic community [5,
14, 13, 6, 4, 2, 15]. As stand alone devices they present a
promising platform for the creation of versatile instruments
for live music performance. Within a single entity, sounds
can be generated and controlled, diﬀerentiating them from
most Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs), and allowing the
creation of instruments much closer to “traditional” acous-
tic instruments in this respect. This resemblance is pushed
even further with mobile phone orchestras such as MoPhO4
[16], where each performer uses a mobile phone as a inde-
pendent musical instrument.

Despite all these qualities, mobile devices were never de-
signed to be used as musical instruments and lack some
crucial elements to compete with their acoustic counter-
parts. In a previous publication [10], we introduced the
concept of “augmented mobile-device” and we presented the
BladeAxe: a hybrid instrument partly based on acous-
tic elements and an iPad. The iPad was used both as a
controller, and to implement virtual physical-model-based
elements of the instrument. The BladeAxe was the last
iteration of a series of mobile-device-based instruments that
we developed during the past four years.
In this article, we try to generalize the concept of “aug-
mented mobile device” and we provide a framework to fa-
cilitate the design of this kind of instrument. We focus on
“passive augmentations” leveraging existing components of
hand-held mobile devices in a very lightweight, non-invasive
way (as opposed to “active augmentation” requiring the use
of electronic components).
We’ll introduceMobile3D, an OpenScad5 library to help
design mobile device augmentations using DIY (Do It Your-
self ) digital fabrication techniques such as 3D printing and
laser cutting. We’ll give an exhaustive overview of the tax-
onomy of the various types of passive augmentations that
can be implemented on mobile devices through a series of
examples and we’ll demonstrate how they leverage exist-
ing components on the device. Finally, we’ll evaluate our
framework and propose future directions for this type of
research.
The software implementation of the instruments presented
in this study will not be discussed. Most of them were made
using the SmartKeyboard App Generator.6
2. MOBILE 3D
Mobile3D is an OpenScad library facilitating the design
of mobile device augmentations. OpenScad is an open-
source Computer Assisted Design (CAD) software using a
high level functional programming language to specify the
shape of any object. It supports fully parametric parts,
permitting users to rapidly adapt geometries to the variety
of devices available on the market.
Mobile3D is organized in diﬀerent ﬁles that are all based
on a single library containing generic standard elements
(basics.scad) ranging from simple useful shapes to more
advanced augmentations such as the ones presented in the
following sections. A series of device-speciﬁc ﬁles adapt the
elements of basics.scad and are also available for the
iPhone 5, 6, and 6 Plus and for the iPod Touch. For ex-
ample, a generic horn usable as a passive ampliﬁer for the
built-in speaker of a mobile device can be simply created

with the following call in OpenScad:
include <basics.scad>
SmallPassiveAmp();
The corresponding 3D object can be seen in Figure 1.
Figure 1: CAD model of a generic passive ampliﬁer
for the built-in speakers of a mobile device.
To generate the same object speciﬁcally for the iPhone 5,
the following code can be written:
include <iPhone5.scad>
iPhone5_SmallPassiveAmp();
Finally, the shape of an object can be easily modiﬁed
either by providing parameters as arguments to the corre-
sponding function, or by overriding them globally before the
function is called. If this approach is chosen, all the parts
called in the OpenScad code will be updated, which can be
very convenient in some cases. For example, the radius (ex-
pressed in millimeters here) ofiPhone5_SmallPassiveAmp()
can be modiﬁed locally by writing:
include <iPhone5.scad>
iPhone5_SmallPassiveAmp(hornRadius=40);
or globally by writing:
include <iPhone5.scad>
iPhone5_SmallPassiveAmp_HornRadius = 40;
iPhone5_SmallPassiveAmp();
Mobile3D is based on two fundamental elements that
can be used to quickly attach any prosthetic to the device:
the top and bottom holders (see Figure 2). They were de-
signed to be 3D printed using elastomeric material such as
NinjaFlex R⃝7 in order to easily install and remove the de-
vice without damaging it. They also help reducing printing
duration, which is often a major issue during prototyping.
These two holders glued to a laser-cut plastic plate form
a sturdy case (as shown in Figure 2), whereas completely
printing this part would take much more time.

A wide range of elements can be easily added to the basic
mobile phone case presented in Figure 2 by using adhesives.
Some of them will be presented in greater details in the
following sections and are part of Mobile3D.
Figure 3 presents an example of an iPhone 5 augmented
with a passive ampliﬁer similar to the one presented above.
The bottom holder and the horn were printed separately
and glued together, but they could also have been printed
as one piece. In this example, the bottom and top holders
were printed with PLA, 8 which is a hard plastic, and they
were mounted on the plate using Velcro R⃝. This is an
alternative solution to usingNinjaFlex R⃝that can be useful
when augmenting the mobile device with large appendixes
requiring a stronger support.

3. LEVERAGING BUILT-IN SENSORS AND
ELEMENTS
Mobile devices host a wide range of built-in sensors and el-
ements that can be used to control sound synthesizers [2,
6]. While the variety of available sensors and elements dif-
fers from one device to another, most smart-phones have
at least a touch screen, a loudspeaker, a microphone, and
some type of motion sensor (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.).
In this section, we’ll focus on these four elements and we’ll
demonstrate how they can be “augmented” for speciﬁc mu-
sical applications.
3.1 Microphone
While the built-in microphone of a mobile device can simply
serve as a source for any kind of sound process (e.g., audio
eﬀect, physical model, etc.), it can also be used as a versa-
tile, high rate sensor. [12] In this section, we demonstrate
how it can be augmented for diﬀerent kinds of uses.
3.1.1 Amplitude-Detection-Based Augmentations
One of the ﬁrst concrete uses of the built-in microphone of
a mobile device to control some sound synthesis process was
done with Smule’s Ocarina 10 [15]. There, the microphone
serves as a blow sensor by measuring the gain of the signal
created when blowing on it to control the gain of an ocarina
sound synthesizer.
Mobile3D contains an object that can be used to lever-
age this principle when placed in front of the microphone
(see Figure 4). It essentially allows the performer to blow
into a mouthpiece mounted on the device. The air-ﬂow is
directed through a small aperture inside the pipe, creating a
sound that can be recorded by the microphone and analyzed
in the app using standard amplitude tracking techniques.
The air-ﬂow is then sent outside of the pipe, preventing it
from ever being in direct contact with the microphone.
The acquired signal is much cleaner than when the per-
former blows directly onto the mic, allowing to generate
precise control data. Additionally, condensation never ac-
cumulates on the mic which can help extend the duration
of its life, etc.

3.1.2 Frequency-Detection-Based Augmentations
The built-in microphone of mobile devices has already been
used as a data acquisition system to implement various
kinds of sensors using frequency analysis techniques [7].
Mobile3D contains an object using similar principles that
can be used to control some of the parameters of a synthe-
sizer running on a mobile device. It is based on a conical
tube (see Figure 5) where dozens of small tines of diﬀerent
length and diameter are placed inside it. These tines get
thicker towards the end of the tube and their length varies
linearly around it. When the performer blows inside the
tube, the resulting airﬂow hits the nails, creating sounds
with varying harmonic content. By directing the airﬂow
towards diﬀerent locations inside the tube, the performer
can generate various kind of sounds that can be recognized
in the app using frequency analysis techniques. The inten-
sity and the position of the airﬂow around the tube can be
measured by keeping track of the spectral centroid of the
generated sound, and used to control synthesis parameters.
The same approach can be used with an inﬁnite number
of augmentations with diﬀerent shapes. While our basic
spectral-centroid-based analysis technique only allows us to
extract two continuous parameters from the generated sig-
nal, it should be possible to get more of them using more
advanced techniques such as those used with MOGEES11 [1].
Nails of different lengths and
diameters change the harmonic
content of the sound
generated by the air flow
going inside the tube

device built-in microphone.
3.2 Speaker
Even though their quality and power has signiﬁcantly in-
creased during the last decade, mobile device built-in speak-
ers are generally only good for speech, not music. This is
mostly due to their small size and the lack of a proper res-
onance chamber to boost bass, resulting in a very curvy
frequency response and a lack of power.
There exists a wide range of passive ampliﬁers on the mar-
ket to boost the sound generated by the built-in speakers
of mobile devices, also attempting to ﬂatten their frequency
response. These passive ampliﬁers can be seen as resonators
driven by the speaker. In this section, we present various
kinds of resonators that can be connected to the built-in
speaker of mobile devices to amplify and/or modify their
sound.
3.2.1 Passive Ampliﬁers and Resonators
Mobile3D contains multiple passive ampliﬁers of various
kinds that can be used to boost the loudness of the built-
in speaker of mobile devices (e.g., see Figure 3). Some of
11http://www.mogees.co.uk
21
them were designed to maximize their eﬀect on the gen-
erated sound [3]. Their shape can vary greatly and will
usually be determined by the type of the instrument. For
example, if the instrument requires the performer to make
fast movements, a small passive ampliﬁer will be preferred
to a large one, etc. Similarly, the orientation of the out-
put of the ampliﬁer will often be determined by the way
the performer holds the instrument, etc. These are design
decisions that are left up to the instrument designer.
3D printed musical instrument resonators (e.g., guitar
body, etc.) can be seen as a special case of passive am-
pliﬁers. Mobile3D contains a few examples of such res-
onators that can be driven by the device’s built-in speak-
ers. While they don’t oﬀer any signiﬁcant advantage over
“standard” passive ampliﬁers like the one presented in the
previous paragraph, they are aesthetically interesting and
perfectly translate the idea of “hybrid lutherie” developed
in [10] and that we emphasize in this study.
3.2.2 Dynamic Resonators
Another way to use the signal generated by the built-in
speakers of mobile devices is to modify it using dynamic res-
onators. For example, in the instrument presented in Fig-
ure 6, the performer’s hand can ﬁlter the generated sound to
create a wah eﬀect. This can be very expressive, especially
if the signal has a dense spectral content. This instrument is
featured in the teaser video [11] of the workshop presented
in §5.
Figure 6: Hand resonator for mobile device built-in
speaker.
Similarly, the sound generated by the built-in speaker is
sent to the mouth of the performer in the instrument pre-
sented in Figure 7. The sound is therefore both modulated
acoustically and through the embedded synthesis and touch-
screen. The same result can obviously be achieved by di-
rectly applying the mouth of the performer to the speaker,
but the augmentation presented in Figure 7 increases the ef-
fect of the oral cavity on the sound through a passive wave
guide.
3.3 Motion Sensors
Most mobile devices have at least one kind of built-in mo-
tion sensor (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.). They are
perfect to continuously control the parameters of sound syn-
thesizer and have been used as such since the beginning of
“mobile music” [2].
Augmentations can be made to mobile devices to direct
and optimize the use of this type of sensor. This kind of
augmentation can be classiﬁed in two main categories:
•augmentations to create speciﬁc kinds of movements
(spin, swing, shake, etc.),

output of the built-in
speaker to the mouth
of the performer

in speaker.
•augmentations related to how the device is held.
Figure 8 presents a “sound toy” where a mobile device
can be spun like a top. This creates a slight “Leslie ef-
fect”, increased by the passive ampliﬁer. Additionally, the
accelerometer and gyroscope data are used to control the
synthesizer running on the device. This instrument is fea-
tured in the teaser video [11] of the workshop presented in
§5.

Another example of motion-sensor-based augmentation is
presented in Figure 13 and described with more details in
§5. It features a smart-phone mounted on a bike wheel [8]
where, once again, the gyroscope and accelerometer data are
used to control the parameters of a synthesizer running on
the device. Similarly, a “rolling smart-phone” is presented
in Figure 12 and described in §5. Mobile3D contains a
series of templates and functions to make this kind of aug-
mentation.
Augmentations leveraging built-in sensors related to how
the device is held are presented in more detail in §4.
3.4 Other Sensors
Most mobile devices host built-in sensors that exceed the
ones presented in the previous sections and are not sup-
ported yet in Mobile3D. For example, built-in cameras can
be used as very versatile sensors, [12] and a wide range of
passive augmentations could be applied to them to “cus-
tomize” their use for musical ends (see §6). We plan to
support more sensors in Mobile3D in the future.

4. HOLDING MOBILE DEVICES
Mobile devices were designed to be held in a speciﬁc way,
mostly so that they can be used conveniently both as a
phone and to use the touch-screen. Passive augmentations
can be designed to hold mobile devices in diﬀerent ways to
help carry out speciﬁc musical gestures, better leveraging
the potential of the touch-screen and of built-in sensors.
More generally, this type of augmentation is targeted
towards making mobile-device-based musical instruments
more engaging and easier to play.
In this section, we give a brief overview of the diﬀerent
types of augmentations that can be made with Mobile3D
to hold mobile devices in diﬀerent ways.
4.1 Wind Instrument Paradigm
One of the ﬁrst attempts to hold a smart-phone as a wind
instrument was Smule’s Ocarina [15], where the screen in-
terface was designed to be similar to a traditional ocarina.
The idea of holding a smart-phone as such is quite appealing
since all ﬁngers (beside the thumbs) of both hands perfectly
ﬁt on the screen (thumbs can be placed on the other side of
the device to hold it). However, this position is impractical
since at least one ﬁnger has to be on the screen in order
to hold the device securely. The simple augmentation pre-
sented in Figure 9 solves this problem by adding “handles”
on both sides of the device so that it can be held using the
palm of the two hands, leaving all ﬁngers (including the
thumbs) free to carry out any action. Several functions and
templates are available in Mobile3D to design these types
of augmentations.
Laser cut handles
Figure 9: Smart-phone augmented to be held as a
wind instrument.
4.2 Holding the Device With One Hand
Mobile3D contains several functions and templates to hold
mobile devices with one hand, leaving at least four ﬁngers
available to perform on the touch-screen. This way to hold
the device opens up a wide range of options to fully take
advantage of the built-in motion sensors and easily execute
free movements. Additionally, the performer can decide to
use two devices in this case (one for each hand).
The instrument presented in Figure 10 uses one of Mo-
bile3D’s ring holders to hold the device with only the thumb.
Similarly, Figure 11 features an instrument held in one hand
using a laser-cut plastic handle mounted on the device.
4.3 Other Holding Options
There are obviously many other options to hold mobile-
devices to carry out speciﬁc musical gestures. For example,
one might hold the device in one hand and perform it with
the other, etc. In any case, we believe that Mobile3D
provides enough options to cover the design needs for most

cal instrument (by Erin Meadows).

musical instruments.
5. MORE EXAMPLES AND EV ALUATION
To evaluate Mobile3D and the framework presented in
this paper, we organized a one-week workshop last sum-
mer at Stanford’s Center for Computer Research in Music
and Acoustics(CCRMA) called The Composed Instrument
Workshop: Intersections of 3D Printing and Digital Audio
for Mobile Platforms [8, 9]. We taught the seven partici-
pants how to make basic musical smart-phone apps using
our SmartKeyboard App Generatorand how to use
Mobile3D to design mobile device augmentations. They
were free to make any musical instrument or sound toy for
their ﬁnal project [9]. Some examples of these instruments
are presented in Figures 3, 12 and 13.
In only one week, participants mastered all these tech-
niques and designed and implemented very original instru-
ment ideas. This helped us debug and improve Mobile3D
with new objects and features.
6. FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In this paper, we only talked about the physical part of
musical instruments based on augmented mobile devices.
As we explained previously, we believe that mobile-devices
oﬀer a great opportunity to make DMIs with a strong co-
herence between the virtual (screen interface, synthesizer,
etc.) and the physical (hardware augmentations, physical
elements playing role in the sound generation process, etc.)
part of the instrument. Additionally, through various kinds
of augmentations combined with intelligent interfaces, they
can help performers to transfer a part of their skills to play
them.
Just like Mobile3D, the SmartKeyboard App Gen-
erator was designed to help musical instrument designers

to solve these problems as a whole. We plan to conduct a
study treating these aspects.
We only talked about passive augmentations here, and we
should obviously not be limited to them. Indeed, modern
micro-controller boards such as the Arduino12 or Teensy13
can easily be used to acquire sensor data and transmit it to
mobile devices. Thus, we plan to further our investigation
to see what kind of active augmentations can be added to
mobile devices to turn them into musical instruments.
7. CONCLUSIONS
Mobile devices constitute an appealing platform to design
digital musical instruments for live performance, bridging
the often broken link between interface, musical gesture and
sound synthesis (which is quite recurring in this family of
instruments).
The deﬁcits of mobile devices can be easily mitigated by
augmenting them with various kinds of prosthetics lever-
aging some of their built-in components and sensors. This
opens the path to a new approach to “digital lutherie” to
make completely standalone “hybrid” instruments, centered
on mobile devices, where some of their components belong
to the virtual world, and others to the physical world.
Lots of work remains to be done to provide a comprehen-
sive solution to help design this type of instruments. We
believe that Mobile3D is the ﬁrst brick in wall that will
keep growing.
