ABSTRACT
Movement-sound interactive systems are at the interface of different artistic and 
educational practices. Within this multiplicity of uses, we examine common 
denominators in terms of learning, appropriation and relationship to technological 
systems. While these topics have been previously reported at NIME, we wanted to 
investigate how practitioners, coming from different perspectives, relate to these 
questions. We conducted interviews with 6 artists who are engaged in movement-
sound interactions: 1 performer, 1 performer/composer, 1 composer, 1 
teacher/composer, 1 dancer/teacher, 1 dancer. Through a thematic analysis of the 
transcripts we identified three main themes related to (1) the mediating role of 
technological tools (2) usability and normativity, and (3) learning and practice. These 
results provide ground for discussion about the design and study of movement-sound 
interactive systems.

Introduction
The study of movement-sound interactive systems, that are designed and developed at 
the intersection of several disciplines, is one of the important areas of NIME research. 
First, these systems are conceptualized through embodied interaction and 
phenomenology, where mind and body are not separated [1]. Second, the development 
of movement-sound interactive systems is also directly driven by technological 
advances. Precisely, the wide availability of motion-based technologies has opened new 
possibilities to either study musical gestures [2], develop Digital Music Instruments 
(DMIs) [3] or experiment with gestures, movement and bodily awareness in dance [4]. 
Finally, these movement-sound interactive systems are also driven by artistic 
endeavors in music, dance, installations, which in turn directly influences how these 
systems are used and modified.
Interestingly, pioneers such as Michel Waisvisz, Laetitia Sonami, Atau Tanaka, or David 
Wessel, to name a few, developed and practiced over the years their own 
instruments/interfaces, even before the NIME conferences started [5]. Since then, 
many new approaches and interfaces have been proposed and evaluated at NIME 
conferences [3][5][6][7]. Moreover, as NIME is largely driven by academic research, it

often focuses on “new” digital musical instruments rather than on singular practices 
over time. Understanding how artist build “mastery” of their digital instruments 
requires analyzing a complex network of questions including skill learning, 
programming, improvisation and composition, and transmission to others. Several 
artists who first developed their once novel instruments pursued to develop their own 
expert practices. While their systems might have been built in collaboration with NIME 
researchers, the following years of practicing and learning, and sometimes restarting 
with different systems, might not have always been reported.
For this reason, we wanted to raise these questions and confront them with artists who 
have practiced with movement-sound interactive systems for several years. The goal of 
this research is to document through interviews how professionals from different 
backgrounds (including performers, composers, dancers, and educators) question their 
practices. Inspired by recent studies based on thematic analysis from semi-directed 
interviews [8][9], we contacted six different artists to reflect on the following questions:
Transmission is meant here as the act of disseminating and/or teaching knowledge and 
systems to peers or students.
The structure of the paper is as follows. First, we recall some key related works, and 
we describe the method. The major part of the article consists in the description of 
three major themes that emerged through the interviews. The results are then 
discussed with regards to the design of movement-based interactions.
Related Work
Movement-sound interactive systems rely on different sensor technologies and data 
processing to map body movement to sound synthesis. Technologies involve motion 
sensing such as cameras [10][11][12], 3D scanners [13], or Inertial Measurement 
Units (IMUs) that embed accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers [14][15][16]
[17][18][19]. Often, instruments do not include visual feedback and users/musicians 
must rely on their own proprioception. In some cases, haptic feedback (passive or 
active) can enhance or facilitate the gestural performance. Different levels of control 
can be designed for the movement-sound interaction: from a deterministic 
relationship, as found in acoustic-like control, to various degrees of indeterminacy 
compatible with more exploratory or improvisational control.
which technological systems do they use and why;
how do they learn, experiment, and practice these systems;
how do they transmit such systems.

By their multimodal nature, movement-sound interactive systems attract various 
practitioners. Certain performers, more focused on music creation, use instruments in 
conjunction with IMUs to create augmented play experiences [20] or a combination of 
motion sensors to create non-tangible interactions with an instrument [21]. In 
movement-oriented practices such as dance, movers use sound interaction to create 
installations for people “to discover new interpretation of their dancing body” [22] or 
foster kinesthetic awareness [23]. Interactive systems can also help music education 
through embodied interaction of certain concepts such as conductor’s gestures [24].
While user studies have been reported on notions such as usability, appropriation [25], 
or sensorimotor learning [26], we wanted to confront these topics with the view of 
different practitioners using movement-sound interactions in creation. Reflexive 
Thematic Analysis, as described by Braun and Clarke [27], is a relevant tool for theme 
extraction from qualitative data such as interview transcripts. It has been used to 
extract mapping design criteria in NIME [8], musical use habits of mobile devices [28] 
or for interviews with sound artists around a given practice [9]. Yet, studies focusing 
on learning and long-term practice remain scarce within the NIME community.
Method
Following the approach of Robson et al. [9] and West et al. [8], we conducted semi-
directed interviews and thematic analysis to better understand how experts relate to 
questions of learning, practice, and relation to technology.
Participants
We contacted 6 artists that used and/or designed movement-sound interactive systems 
in their practice. All artists collaborated or were in contact with the last two authors, 
but not the first author who led the interviews. All artists accepted to participate in the 
study, and give the consent to the publication of the article. We led three interviews at 
the beginning of 2021 and the rest at the end of the year. We ensured gender balance 
and covered various practices: we interviewed 2 music performers (Mari Kimura and 
Philippe Spiesser), 2 dancers (Bertha Bermudez and Yves Candau), 1 teacher (Fabrice 
Guédy) and 1 composer (Michelle Agnes Magalhaes). A description of the interviewees’ 
background is available in appendix.
Study Design
This study aimed to investigate how practitioners engage with learning and 
appropriating technologies that mediate movement and sound in artistic or

pedagogical contexts. The interviews were semi-structured around five topics with a 
set of questions that could be adapted to the practice of the interviewee: (1) 
background and motivation in using movement sensors; (2) the process of learning 
movement and/or sound; (3) the transmission of such systems; (4) technology 
appropriation (by performers and public); (5) limitations and perspectives. A list of the 
generic questions asked is available in appendix.
Two of the interviews were led in person and the rest over video conference. 
Interviews lasted between 90 and 120 minutes. Interviews were automatically 
transcribed first using Microsoft Speech to Text service, and then manually corrected 
using the audio recording.
Analysis
We decided to do a reflexive Thematic Analysis (TA) on the transcripts, as described by 
Braun and Clarke [27]. TA is a qualitative data analysis method, well established in the 
social sciences and psychology, that enables researchers to extract patterns of 
meaning called themes across a dataset. It consists, after familiarization with the data, 
of a first phase of coding and a second phase of theme development. Reflexive TA 
differs from other TA techniques in that it acknowledges the subjectivity that lies in 
qualitative data interpretation. The theme development emerges from the 
interpretative work of the researcher made from the codes. The codes do not come 
from a codebook but are generated by the researcher when analyzing the data. The 
themes should not be defined prior to the coding and must emerge as patterns from 
those codes. Moreover, reflexive TA is “theoretically flexible”, not bound to certain 
methodologies that were initially meant for psychotherapy research and psychology. It 
applies to a broad range of domains and more generally suits the exploration of 
participants’ subjective experiences [29].
We all individually coded the transcripts and regrouped them under potential themes. 
We then converged together toward three main themes: (1) Practitioners consider 
technology as mediating practice, (2) they navigate usability and normativity, and (3) 
their learning process is entangled with the development of a personal practice.
Theme 1: Technology Mediates Practice
During the interview we explicitly asked the artists to position their work and 
approaches with respect to the use of technologies. We did not provide any definition 
of what technologies could refer to, and let them describe how they situate themselves 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Entangling Practice with Artistic and Educational Aims: Interviews on
Technology-based Movement-Sound Interactions

with this large topic. We can describe their discourses by what technology is, why 
using it and how. 
What is Technology, Why Use it and How?
First, they either use the term “technology” in a very general sense (which could be 
induced by the fact we use it in questions), or they refer to the specific tools they have 
been using in their work (such as the Kinect, smartphones, etc). They do not refer to 
specific categories as used in engineering fields such as motion capture, machine 
learning or AI, to cite examples of categories currently widely used. Interestingly, YC 
even considers “A somewhat extended notion of technology. As one could say that 
language is a technology, that writing is a technology” (YC).
Importantly, technology is neither considered as a “theme” or “goal” in their practice, 
but rather as something embedded in a socio-cultural context, e.g. as “[musical] 
instruments with today's technology” (PS). They all consider that integrating 
technology in a personal practice is a complex process that demands significant 
engagement to become a meaningful part of the practice as opposed to development 
made “for the sake of technology” (BB). By considering technologies an integral part of 
the practice, thus as a mean of expression, such an approach contrasts with other 
fields involving research and development which might prioritize novel technologies 
within a solutionist perspective.
Technology is therefore never thought of as a “solution” to a given problem, nor as a 
mean to realize an artistic vision. It is rather seen as a beneficial “perturbation”, 
enabling them to “move out of their comfort zone” (PS), or something they have to deal 
with. In all cases, it should be grounded in a methodological approach, that might need 
to be invented.  Possibility of looking for systems failures or finding inspiration in bugs 
are also explicitly described.
I like when there are bugs, because it's in these interstices that there are often 
opportunities to find things that you wouldn't have found if everything had been 
done beforehand (FG).
Technology Can Act as a Mediator for Transmitting Concepts and Ideas
Most artists also considered interactive technologies as a support for transmission. 
The most prominent example is FG who uses, among other things, movement 
technologies to help teach music theory to young students. Using those technologies is 
a way to create bridges between tradition in music education and the world of

computer science, and “it is very clear that the de-compartmentalization that it 
produces in students is something that works." (FG). BB has never experienced 
movement interaction technologies as “a tool for the process of creation to be 
enhanced. But for me, it has been a tool really for transmission.” A tool that she uses 
to initiate and teach non dancers movement practices. For BB, working with 
interactive systems requires producing a synthetic model of the practice, which 
benefits its transmission: 
It helped me to understand […] how to make it accessible. Because reducing, 
summarizing, also helped us change the transmission, develop a clearer 
terminology, be more conscious, really, of what we make. (BB)
The Mediating Role of Technology Might be Unclear for the Audience
Performances with movement technologies are still new to the general audience. YC, 
PS and FG reported that there was an effort to be made towards the understanding 
and/or acceptance of this interaction by part of the public. PS and YC pointed out that 
There is this attitude, as a first response to a new system, of wanting to 
understand what is going on. (YC) 
The technology becomes central in the performance, overshadowing the artistic 
proposition. For MK, however: “if you have the motion sensor that is moving, people 
can actually see and relate to the electronic sounds better.” In this perspective, the 
interaction actually links the audience to the produced sound. But further work is 
needed for spectators to adapt to the interaction, particularly with non tangible 
interfaces, where the underlying link between movement and sound is blurred :
That is, the smallest gesture you make becomes an identifiable and interpretable 
musical gesture for an audience. (PS)
Theme 2: Navigating Usability, Normativity and Obsolescence
As interviews revolved around technology, interviewees offered insights regarding the 
usability of interactive systems. In particular, the potential and ease of use of some 
technologies and feedback modalities over others was discussed. Critically, the 
question of the normative power of technologies over their users was a recurring 
theme of the interviews, as well as issues of obsolescence.

Technology Requires Commitment and Friction
Most participants have a history of practice that involves the use of wearable sensors 
embedding IMUs. They are appreciated because they are easy to set up, are minimally 
invasive and have a low latency. In particular, mobile phones greatly facilitate setup. 
While usability is appreciated, interviewees still emphasized that working with 
technology takes time and requires dedication, engagement and commitment. 
Reflecting on a decade of experience, MK reported: 
I’ve practiced well enough using just one thing. [...] But in order to refine your 
movement and try to incorporate that into a tool that’s useful for musical 
expression, you really need to spend time with it. (MK)
Issues such as calibration and parameterization have a learning curve but are critical 
for both performance and transmission. All interviewees emphasized a desire to escape 
a triggering paradigm found limited and often associated with a “gadget”. Yet, 
apprehending more complex forms of interaction can be difficult. For PS, as complexity 
increases, “you can get overwhelmed very quickly because you become a human 
synthesizer and so all you do is sound.” Apprehending such increasing complexity is 
not easy and interpreters need to learn to play with the subtleties of movement. Yet, 
interviewees often valued the friction that occurs over the development of a practice:
Because the tool resists, the user will persist a little bit in doing it and that's 
where he'll find things that I find interesting. Typically, in the gesture tracking, 
[…] it wouldn't have worked if it had worked right away. It's a paradoxical way of 
putting it, but I think that's what can make you think bigger. (FG)
Normative Technologies should be Avoided
Practitioners value friction — to some extent — as a mechanism going against 
potentially normative effects of technology. In creative practices, technologies should 
not be designed to solve problems and facilitate use to the extent of “infantilization”. 
What motivates FG is “this interweaving”:
We are not going to use ready-made technology. […] What is interesting is to 
associate it from the start, to think about several disciplines at the same time, 
which will then be mixed together. You're not going to be interested in 
transmitting a technological brick, but really more the process of reflection behind 
the creation. (FG)

Several interviewees reflected on the history of technology in art, drawing 
comparisons between early experiments with technologies that aimed to broaden the 
scope of possibilities, and some contemporary technologies that have become 
normative. Most interviewees make efforts to foster creativity and personality in their 
transmission of the technologies rather than a form of imitation and replication:
We do our best to reproduce the best performance but as soon as we think like 
that, everything is screwed up because we will put ourselves in a mechanical 
mode. [...]   And as soon as we are there, focused on the result, we are no longer in 
the present. (MAM)
In creation and pedagogy, technology therefore aims to emancipate students and 
support the development of a personal practice rather than help them reproduce an 
“ideal” result. 
Obsolescence
The notion of obsolescence consistently emerged throughout discussions with all 
practitioners, even though it was not introduced by the researchers as part of the 
interview structure. With the rapid pace of technological innovation, interactive 
systems can rapidly become outdated and unusable. Such obsolescence creates 
tensions among artists with regards to the preservation of creations.
Ligeti didn’t want to go into interactive because he thought that the technology 
will be obsolete, and he’s correct, that if you write in a certain way and if that 
technology dies, your piece dies. (MK)
For MK, such obsolescence is not problematic because her works, her creations will 
survive. Yet, obsolescence can make transmission hard, as platform updates might 
prevent students from using the software. For BB, what matters is the persistence of 
methods and knowledge over time rather than the technology itself:
The installation, maybe if we put it back it doesn't work anymore. It's not a maybe, 
it is the reality. […] That's a problem, you could say, it's really a problem because 
the tool itself is obsolete. But not the creation process. What did we do during the 
creation? That's not obsolete, because we're still here. So we have to talk about 
that, we have to leave a trace because I think it's important, I think it's quite 
unique. (BB)

Theme 3: Learning and the Development of a Personal Practice
Learning was one of the key themes introduced in the interviews. Our analysis 
revealed key learning processes and insights into how technologies can be designed to 
structure movement learning. Importantly, interviewees emphasized that learning is 
highly intertwined with the development of a personal practice. 
Discovering, Experimenting and Challenging Limits
Approaching a new form of interaction involves several phases of discovery, 
exploration and integration. When experimenting with a new interactive system, 
people tend to rely on their existing skills:
So I think in a learning system, you always start with the things you know first and 
try to apply them to a new environment. I tried to look for those gestures that I 
knew. For example, in this virtual instrument system, I imagined hitting a skin, I 
imagined hitting a block, shaking the maracas, doing a deathstroke. And so I tried 
to reproduce these gestures, I started from there. (PS)
In this early stage, the quality of attention is essential: the mover must remain open to 
the feedback provided by the system to get acquainted with a new action-perception 
loop. This involves moving while listening to the system’s responses, as emphasized by 
MK: “You know hand movements or body movements, but then use their movement to 
incorporate the sensors and the first thing I usually do with the students is that I have 
them wear it right now […] and see if there’s any relevant thing that you can use as an 
expression”. Often, as previously mentioned, this exploration is initially driven by the 
desire to understand the interaction at play. 
Naturally, all interviewees emphasized the need for experimentation and exploration. 
FG, describing learning in a pedagogical context: “At the workshop, we try without 
having a clear goal, but we know that it is still interesting to try. [...] In fact, the desire 
itself often refers to something that we want to see, like a child who, even if he doesn't 
know what the toy is for, will try to throw it”. Whether practicing for a choreographed 
or improvised outcome, many participants mentioned improvisation as a key marker in 
the learning process. Improvisation can be seen both as a mean to explore the 
capabilities of an artifact and a form of challenge to oneself, that assesses their ability 
to interact and express with the system. Such experimentation involves exploration 
and exploitation, and repetition is key in acquiring embodied skills: “Through the 
repetition of the same gesture, you can learn, and that's exactly what we do. So you 
can learn from repetition, that's what you do in a dance studio.” (BB). Experimentation

11
is considered essential to explore the instrument but also as a process that extends 
beyond the use of the technology itself:
It's the very activity of coding that is interesting, to think in a certain way. 
Afterwards, we go back to the piano, to the violin, but we have understood things 
differently, and we have explored a whole space. That's what it allows you to do, to 
experiment and to try, but not with the aim of necessarily making an application.” 
(FG)
Once the initial phase of discovery leads to an understanding of the interaction, 
performers often challenge the system, exploring its limits to understand where it 
breaks.
One interesting thing is that we always try to do two things: one, we understand 
the system, so we do it, we are obedient, [...] and then we try to break the system, 
and see when it doesn't work. [...] Almost all the dancers did the same. (BB) 
Finding limits involves exploring the potential and shortcomings of the technology, but 
it is also seen as a process of one’s exploration of their own abilities and habits. 
Technology “helps me to understand the material better and to get out of a habitus 
that normally I would have in the studio” (BB).
Technologies can be Designed to Facilitate Learning
The way interactive systems are designed can affect their learnability, in the context of 
open-ended learning processes that integrates with a personal practice. Several 
factors that could inform the design of learnable interactions emerged through the 
interviews. First, as highlighted above, constraints provide valuable stimulation for 
learning, for they drive attentional processes and challenge the performer’s habits. 
Systems can be designed to stimulate movement through metaphors and images, or 
more implicitly so that movement emerges through interaction.
The identification of sound-movement [...] will be learned by the body, but I don't 
need to verbalize it. He will understand if he turns it like this that it won't work 
because it's not the right sound. But I don't need to write a detailed instruction for 
that because the own object, the device itself will indicate that it's not in the right 
direction. It's also about trusting the body. The body is not stupid. (MAM)
For PS, interactive systems can be designed for learning by relying on play: “[a child] 
will learn gestures very quickly, by himself. So if we can frame it, find an interaction, 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Entangling Practice with Artistic and Educational Aims: Interviews on
Technology-based Movement-Sound Interactions
12
it's a bit like video games. You go through different stages.” However, several 
interviewees mentioned the need for adaptability, so that “you make your own path” 
(PS). It is important to find a balance between “a technology that adapts to the 
interpreter”, and the need for interpreters to adapt to, learn from and appropriate the 
technology.
It's not a tool that I could pass on to anyone. It's a technology, it's a way of seeing 
things. After that, it's up to you to adapt it, to imagine an interesting use. (FG)
Learning is Intertwined with the Development of Personal Practice
Reflecting on the details of one’s learning process seems to be challenging, because 
contrary to other fields involving movement learning such as sports, that are task-
oriented, expression is often the primary purpose. Learning appears to be inseparable 
from the development of a personal practice: quoting BB, “I think that at the level of 
movement acquisition or understanding it was not about the form or the execution, but 
rather about the personal practice, how you work.” Depending on the focus of the 
interviewee, technology can mediate with the theoretical underpinnings of the 
practice, can foster movement practice and kinesthetic awareness, or can support 
creativity. When technology is used to support an embodied practice such as dance, its 
reflective qualities can help mediate embodied experiences, helping the mover become 
aware of their body, of particular movements, of felt experiences: 
It helps to be conscious of what you do [...] because you have a response, the 
movement becomes almost tactile. It becomes tangible. The movement has a 
trace, either in sound or in images, that reflects what you just did. (BB)
As such, the learning process is not merely about gaining pure control over the 
instrument, but about developing skills within a personal practice, by drawing upon 
the shifts in the lived experience induced by an external feedback. Sound feedback 
brings attention to the movement from another modality, therefore structuring 
experience. 
Technology can structure learning but can also structure experience. There's 
something a little more marked, with fewer dimensions, and that allows you to 
channel the experience. (YC)
Technology can therefore shape movement but it affects perception more broadly, 
quoting MAM: “what I really want is for musicians to come out of an experience like 
that transformed. That they can act on their field of perception”. As a result, most 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Entangling Practice with Artistic and Educational Aims: Interviews on

13
interviewees view their interactions with technology beyond the pure control of an 
instrument, as a reflective and conversational process. Technology is considered 
beyond a tool or an instrument, as “a partner, who helps me to think about what I am 
doing” (BB).
What characterizes the entanglement of learning and practice development is the 
search for a compromise between freedom and constraints. The use of extrinsic 
feedback on movement brings constraints that are found stimulating for learning, as a 
way to structure attention, because “There is a big difference when it's a personal 
choice and when it's a choice that comes from outside. And also the personal choices, 
often, happen more automatically. So there's really a gain in having choices that are 
made from the outside” (YC). For YC, changes and ruptures of the interaction over 
time were found particularly stimulating: 
I would say that the things that are very strong in the experience are moments of 
surprise, for example where there is something established that I can interact 
with, and I develop some sense of what can be done, and then all of a sudden 
there is something else that manifests itself, that appears in response to 
something that I am doing, but that was not there before. (YC)
Such external constraints drive performers out of common patterns and habits. Yet, 
technology is used by artists to support an expressive practice, and all interviewees 
expressed the need for a certain degree of freedom: “it was important to find myself as 
an interpreter. I trigger things, but I also have the possibility to be free between some 
triggers, to feel breaths” (PS). Such freedom is necessary so that interaction lets 
personality and idiosyncrasies emerge among different interpreters: “Obviously the 
piece is totally different with the same parameters. That's what they can influence, 
they can put their personality without having to change the system exactly” (PS).
Discussion
Expressivity in Question
An important question raised by the NIME community, at least at its start, concerns 
the notion of “expressivity” — which is included in the NIME acronym [30][31][32]. 
The use of embodied interaction involving movements and the body for music 
performance certainly questions how musical expression can be conveyed to the 
public. Interestingly, even when explicitly questioned, the notion of expressivity was 
regarded as somehow ill-defined or not considered as an important topic to discuss

Technology-based Movement-Sound Interactions
14
frontally. Therefore, it would seem that the use of gestures is not meant to enhance or 
facilitate expressivity, as one could naively believe. 
The notion of “expressivity” appeared indirectly, when the interviewees, especially the 
ones concerned with music performance, did mention spontaneously that the public 
reception could be problematic. The “expressive intention” behind the movements and 
gestures might not be always perceived by the audience, especially if they are 
unfamiliar with such approaches of technology. “How should spectators experience a 
performer’s interaction with a computer?” [33], Reeves and al. questioned nearly two 
decades ago. The reactions of part of the audience raise a more general question: who 
are sound-movement interaction systems designed for ? It seems that they grow from 
the need of pushing certain boundaries in one’s practice, and therefore help interact 
differently with sound or gesture, the finality remaining the same: nurturing creativity. 
So when transitioning from the studio to the stage, the technology should not be the 
center of attention. The use of new technologies on stage requires thinking about the 
perception of the performance by the audience.
To face this challenge it is possible to use spectator experience augmentation 
techniques (SEAT), that helps improve the audience experience, as shown by Capra et 
al. [34]. However, “the word ‘audience’ suggests a passive role, whereby you are 
rewarded with culture simply by virtue of turning up” [9]. Robson et al. have 
interviewed sound artists who are engaged in situated sonic practices. One of the 
interviewees noted that “[Visitors] need to do something to bring the whole installation 
together, move around and fetch different parts.”1 . Similarly to sound installations 
where receivers must actively make sense of the piece by changing their spatial 
relationship to it, it would be beneficial in the process of “restoring trust with the 
spectators” [34] to help get them from being part of a passive audience to active 
receivers, not of a technological demonstration, but of an artistic proposition. 
Questioning the role of technology
In all interviews, the view of technology is ambivalent, navigating between normativity 
and emancipation. While it is considered central to current artistic practices, as part of 
a global socioeconomic system, it is also seen as a “tool” to experiment and create 
beyond norms. This creates an interesting paradox, since the need for experimentation 
might go against the establishment of standards that are necessary for community 
building and transmission. Moreover, obsolescence is unavoidable, based on evidence 
of using technologies for several years, and yet the general concepts that are 
developed are intended to resist technological evolution. This brings important

Technology-based Movement-Sound Interactions
15
questions about transmission and pedagogy, some of which have been brought up by 
several researchers [35][36][37]. We believe that it opens a large and interesting 
debate, since this necessitates to establish what in our practices is truly independent 
from technological artifacts.
Supporting Learning
It appears that pedagogy inherited from standard music practices does not encompass 
the variety of musical practices that exists today. Particularly in improvisation 
practices, as shown by Hayes [38], the notion of graduating from novices to expert 
with a predefined educational path does not apply, as it puts the skillful musical 
instrument expertise before the value of “the instantiation of multiple sensitivities of 
the person as a whole” [38]. The role of interactive systems is fundamentally perceived 
as elements that should be sufficiently modular, and assembled in different manners. 
As such, interviews highlighted that systems can be designed to facilitate learning, 
through metaphors, images, play, and interactive feedback supporting movement 
execution. This can be linked to the use of different types of affordances as suggested 
by Altavilla et al. [39]. Because such systems alter the action-perception loop, they 
bring external constraints that structure the lived movement experienced, and 
stimulate attention and kinesthetic awareness. Yet, designing systems in a way that 
eases the learning process involves a number of challenges. Crafting the right level of 
detail for movement-sound interactions can hardly be optimized for all learners, 
because the learning process is open-ended and intertwined with the user’s own 
personal practice. As such, interviews show that performers often co-evolve with the 
system, progressively uncovering subtleties in movement expression. Designing such 
adaptive systems seems promising but requires delineating what should change and 
what should remain consistent within a learning process that is always personal.
Conclusion
The interviews we conducted were found fruitful to bring a different light to NIME 
research about movement-sound interactive systems. As discussed by other researcher 
in this field, it is intrinsically difficult, or maybe fundamentally impossible, to translate 
global methods borrowed from traditional music practices, in term of composition and 
pedagogy, to practices based on interactive technology. Nevertheless, the insights 
given by the artists still reveals how important it is to privilege strong concepts over 
detailed implementation, the importance of openness and modularity of the system, 
and how constraints and perturbations can be fruitful in artistic contexts.
