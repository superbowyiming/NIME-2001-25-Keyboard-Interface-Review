ABSTRACT
This demo will showcase technologically mediated interac-
tions between a performer playing a smart musical instru-
ment (SMIs) and audience members using Musical Haptic
Wearables (MHWs). Smart Instruments are a family of mu-
sical instruments characterized by embedded computational
intelligence, wireless connectivity, an embedded sound de-
livery system, and an onboard system for feedback to the
player. They oﬀer direct point-to-point communication be-
tween each other and other portable sensor-enabled devices
connected to local networks and to the Internet. MHWs
are wearable devices for audience members, which encom-
pass haptic stimulation, gesture tracking, and wireless con-
nectivity features. This demo will present an architecture
enabling the multidirectional creative communication be-
tween a performer playing a Smart Mandolin and audience
members using armband-based MHWs.

1. INTRODUCTION
This demo will showcase an architecture supporting novel
forms of interactions between live music performers and au-
dience members. Such interactions are enabled by the mul-
tidirectional communication between smart musical instru-
ments (SMIs) and Musical Haptic Wearables (MHWs).
SMIs are a family of musical instruments characterized by
embedded computational intelligence, wireless connectivity,
an embedded sound delivery system, and an onboard system
for feedback to the player [10]. They oﬀer direct point-to-
point communication between each other and other portable
sensor-enabled devices connected to local networks and to

the Internet. An example of devices that can be connected
to SMIs are the MHWs proposed in [8].
MHWs are a novel class of wearable devices for audi-
ence members, which encompass haptic stimulation, ges-
ture tracking, and wireless connectivity features. MHWs
were devised to enrich musical experiences by leveraging
the sense of touch as well as providing new capabilities for
creative participation. Their conception was grounded on
the ﬁndings of research in the ﬁeld of haptic technologies
developed for musical applications (see e.g., [1, 2, 5]) and of
participatory live music performances (see e.g., [11]).
SMIs and MHWs are components of an ecosystem of in-
teroperable musical devices that has been recently termed as
“Internet of Musical Things” (IoMusT) [9]. Such an ecosys-
tem can support novel forms of interactions between live
music performers and audience members.
2. THE DEMO
This demo will present an architecture enabling the mul-
tidirectional creative communication between a performer
playing a prototype of SMIs, the Smart Mandolin, and au-
dience members using a prototype of MHWs based on an
armband.
The Smart Mandolin (see Figure 1) is an exemplar of
smart musical instrument, which is based on a previous pro-
totype belonging to the family of augmented instruments
[4], the Hyper-Mandolin reported in [7]. It consists of the
enhancement of a familiar acoustic mandolin with a con-
tact microphone, sensors, actuators, the Bela board for low-
latency audio processing [3], an embedded loudspeaker, Wi-
Fi, and a lightweight power supply. Software-wise, a Pure
Data application was coded to processes with eﬀects the
sound captured by the microphone, generate sounds from
synthesizers and samplers, extract audio features, and map
the interactions of the player with the sensors to sound pa-
rameters.
Four instances of an armband-based MHW were devel-
oped (see Figure 2). These devices feature various hard-
ware components also present in the Smart Mandolin as
well as two actuators and two push buttons. A dedicated
Pure Data application synthesizes tactile stimuli by means
of Pulse Width Modulation techniques.
The Smart Mandolin and the MHWs are connected to a
local wireless network by means of a router (featuring the
IEEE 802.11.ac standard over the 5GHz band). Interoper-
ability between the two devices is achieved with Open Sound
Control messages over UDP. Figure 3 shows a schematic rep-
resentation of the interactions between the Smart Mandolin
player and the audience members, which are enabled by the
developed architecture.
The Smart Mandolin is conﬁgured to extract in real-time
from the acoustic signal captured by the microphone, the
82
strums performed on the strings, thanks to an onset de-
tection algorithm [6]. The timing and amplitude of those
strums having an amplitude above a certain threshold are
sent synchronously and simultaneously to the four MHWs.
This information is mapped to vibrations of amplitude and
duration proportional to the detected strum.
To create participatory interactions, the two buttons present
in the MHWs may be used by an audience member to deliver
to the Smart Mandolin player messages capable of trigger-
ing backing tracks. The selected backing tracks are then
delivered by the instrument’s integrated loudspeaker.
During the demo we will ﬁrst illustrate the Smart Man-
dolin prototype. Secondly we will provide attendees with
the developed prototypes of MHWs. Thirdly we will show-
case the interactions described above.
Videos of the Smart Mandolin and of the of the developed
MHWs are available at www.iomut.eu/video.html.
