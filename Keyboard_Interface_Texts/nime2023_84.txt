ABSTRACT
The development of bespoke musical tools such as many
accessible digital musical instruments (ADMI) can neces-
sitate specific design constraints. Within a field which of-
ten promotes out of the box thinking and new interactions
with experimental technologies, how do we design for user
groups where these notions of interaction will be less famil-
iar, and/or increasingly challenging due to the progression
of cognitive decline?
The relationship between age and the use of technol-
ogy is understood within the wider context of human com-
puter interaction (HCI), however, how this applies specifi-
cally to musical interaction or contributes to a ‘dementia-
friendly’ approach to digital musical instrument (DMI) de-
sign is drastically underrepresented within the NIME com-
munity. Following a scoping review of technology for arts
activities designed for older adults with cognitive decline,
we ran a series of involvement activities with a range of
stakeholders living with, or caring for those living with de-
mentia. Consolidating the knowledge and experience shared
at these events, we propose five considerations for designing
dementia-friendly digital musical instruments. We illustrate
our approach with a range of new instruments co-designed
to enable increased interaction with music for people living
with dementia.

ties with memory, problem-solving, or language, that are

tivities. Research shows that frequent and sustained en-

gagement with music can have a positive impact on older
adults’ wellbeing in general, [8, 7], and for those living with
dementia it can help them to reconnect with past inter-
ests and their sense of self [2], stimulate awareness of the
present moment, as well as past memories [5, 4], enhancing
the quality of their day to day life.
A recent scoping review [27] of the use of technology for
arts-based activities in older adults living with mild cog-
nitive impairment or dementia demonstrates a wealth of
good yet isolated approaches to the design of digital tools.
Frid [11] reviews the ADMIs presented at NIME, SMC and
ICMC conferences, highlighting a distinct lack of represen-
tation for the needs of this group, however demonstrates the
positive power and growing presence of ADMIs for those
with physical impairment.
In this paper we outline the progress of a research journey
exploring the design and iterative development of advanced
musical technologies created specifically for people living
with dementia. Through a serious of involvement activities,
working alongside a group of adults with a range of physical
and cognitive abilities, we are exploring the challenges and
barriers to musical interaction that are posed by cognitive
decline. We feel we are not alone, and would like to start
a conversation within the NIME community about how to
develop assistive musical interfaces that help older adults
engage with music.
We present five initial design considerations, that have
developed from conversations with our stakeholders dur-
ing playful musical interactions with digital musical instru-
ments. We demonstrate our approach to dementia-friendly
DMI design through the construction of a range of ADMIs
used in our involvement activities.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Adults living with Dementia and the Arts
As of 2022, approximately 55.2 million people across the
world are living with dementia, with sharp rises predicted
over the next few decades [47]. Despite increasing acknowl-
edgement that music can be a powerful aide in the daily
lives of those living with or caring for someone living with
dementia, the devices used to interact with music are often
limited and the theory behind their design disparate.
2.1.1 Technology, dementia and the Arts
A recent scoping review [27] investigating the use of technol-
ogy for arts-based activities in older adults living with mild
cognitive impairment or dementia highlights a wide range
of (mainly) prototype devices in use. The review discusses
51 technologies currently in use, 28 of which are music fo-
cused. The majority of these technologies (n=19) are for
‘listening’ to music and provide access to playlists and sim-
plified listening devices. Of the 9 devices intended for ‘music
making’, 3 use games controllers (Wii / PlayStation / Air-
Sticks), 5 are computer screen / tablet based, and only 1 is
a tactile object.
Another exception is Treadaway [39], who introduces 4
examples of tangible multi-sensory objects developed through
a series of ludic workshops with those living with dementia.
The authors reflect “one of the most pressing challenges fac-
ing designers today is how to create appropriate, useful and
safe designs”.
2.1.2 Accessible Digital Musical Instruments
Although small in number and specific in nature, the no-
tion of accessible digital musical instruments (ADMIs) is
growing in NIME literature [11, 12, 10, 25]. Frid [11] sur-
veys the history of ADMIs presented at the NIME, SMC
and ICMC conferences, discussing multiple notions of ‘ac-
cessibility’ in digital instruments. The author uses the term
ADMI to denote a wide range of both ‘adapted / adaptive’
([14, 24]) and ‘inclusive’ instruments [45]. The paper iden-
tifies 30 reported ADMIs with wide ranging approaches and
destinations. In contrast to the devices in use with those
living with dementia reviewed in our scoping review [27],
the majority of the ADMIs reviewed by Frid prioritise tan-
gible interaction [20] with very few (<10%) relying on touch
screens or computer based interfaces. The paper concludes
that the majority of these are intended for the physically
disabled and younger age groups, with only two examples
of ADMIs focused at the elderly, and only one with a fo-
cus on those living with dementia. Favilla and Pedell [9]
discuss the design of dementia friendly instruments imple-
mented on touch screen devices. Although deemed success-
ful in the experiences they enabled, the authors reflect on
the need for one-two-one scaffolding to facilitate access to
the technology. Building on Frid [11], Ilsar and Kenning
[19] chart the development from DMI to ADMI, reflecting
that “ADMIs free the music maker from relying on screen,
keyboard and mouse-based interfaces” showing its ability
to lead to “greater opportunities for exploration, improvi-
sation, empowerment and flow through music making for
people living with disabilities.”
So how do we design ADMIs for older adults potentially
living with some degree of physical impairment and increas-
ing challenges from the progression of cognitive decline?
Within HCI, awareness of the relationship between age and
the use of technology continues to grow [16, 42, 15], with de-
mentia focused [13] and “age-friendly” [29] approaches dis-
cussed, however this lacks presence in the approaches re-
viewed in the development of this paper. Leading disability
and music charities Drake Music1 and the OHMI Trust 2
champion the cause for those with physical disabilities in the
UK, however there seems to be a lack of similar provision
for those living with cognitive issues or comorbidity.
Ward[45] discusses design considerations for digital mu-
sical instruments for users with complex needs in SEN set-
tings, referencing a range of existing design frameworks from
NIME ([23, 30]) and wider HCI ([18, 43]) backgrounds. The
authors present 18 design considerations developed through
literature review and practice based work. The author’s
wider review of Music Technologies used in Music Therapy
for a range of clients with complex needs [44], calls for the
“development of accepted, common guidelines from experts
1https://www.drakemusic.org/
2https://www.ohmi.org.uk/
in the field. . . to includes the need to create a taxonomy of
understanding (to codify the pitfalls, methods, and poten-
tials) incorporating the vocabulary, structure, and architec-
ture of technology (specifically of handheld music devices)
into clinical practice”.
2.2 A/DMI Design Theory
Music technology can provide unique opportunities to ac-
cess music making for those with complex needs [45]. Digital
tools provide the ability to augment and support physical
and cognitive impairments in unique and specific ways so as
to address varied challenges to inclusion. Through its slow
move away from traditional HCI style investigation, NIME
research provides a platform for more player focused and ex-
perience based approaches to understanding and designing
for music specific interaction.
2.2.1 Player centred approaches to design
Rodger [36] explores how instruments contribute toward
meaningful musical experiences, claiming “instruments are
better understood in terms of processes rather than as de-
vices, while musicians are not users, but rather agents in
musical ecologies”. The authors replace the standard HCI
evaluation frameworks with an alternative approach incor-
porating ecological, psychology, enactivism, and phenomenol-
ogy. These notions of player and experience centred design
are promoted by Morreale [30] through the MINUTE frame-
work, and later echoed by Ward [45] as she calls for “focus
not only on the instruments being designed, but also the
system as a whole and the system in relation to the context
of use”.
2.2.2 Experience and Enaction
Varela [41] focused on the lived experience, and the mind’s
ability to enact meaning from interaction with its environ-
ment through sensorimotor exploration. Varela states the
enactive approach consists of two key points: (1) percep-
tion consists in perceptually guided action and (2) cognitive
structures emerge from the recurrent sensorimotor patterns
that enable action to be perceptually guided.
Essl & O’Modhrain [6] define enaction as “the necessary
and close link between action and perception”, linking their
concept of enaction to tacit knowledge, stating it to be
“inevitably dependent upon embodied knowledge, the kind
of knowledge that is derived from being and acting in the
world”. The authors propose an enactive approach to the
design of new tangible music instruments, stating the design
intention to “retain the familiar tactile aspect of the inter-
action so that the performer can take advantage of tacit
knowledge gained through experience with such phenom-
ena in the real world”. O‘Modhrain [32] states: “Enactive
interfaces are desirable because they allow the user to utilise
their preconceived knowledge of interacting with the world
when using the interface”.
More recently greater understanding of the perception of
materials used in the design of DMIs highlights the further
potential for lived experience and tacit knowledge of the
world around us to guide and suggest musical interactions,
delving in to the hidden language of sensors [34, 31], mate-
rials [35, 48] and controls [21].
3. METHODOLOGY
Presented below are five design considerations for dementia-
friendly DMI design. These considerations have been devel-
oped from an extensive scoping review [27] of technologies
in use today with those living with dementia, and just under
a year of consultation with community partners and stake-
holders, including those living with dementia, their carers,
and surrounding support agencies. Our work to date in-
cludes the development of a group of instruments that be-
gin to explore the wants and needs for musical interaction
of people living with dementia. The design considerations
detailed below are consolidated from a series of four involve-
ment activities run with our stakeholder groups. In these
activities, we i) discussed the broad aims of the research,
and ii) trialed the range of instruments developed. This lat-
ter activity prompted further discussion on experiences and
realities for the different stakeholders in relation to diverse
caring contexts. The outcomes below incorporate these dis-
cussion points as well as the reflections of the research team
on these activities.
In terms of setting and method for our work, we take
influence from the experience based approaches reviewed
above [36, 30, 45] and propose that embedding this in the
design of DMIs for people living with dementia unequivo-
cally points toward a co-design process. Involving people
living with dementia in all stages of the design process al-
lows us to better define the parameters of agency required
within each musical interaction, the range of contexts the
interaction may be applied to, and to appreciate the diver-
sity in how individuals may respond to each interaction.
3.1 Instructions Not Included:
Dementia-Friendly DMI Design
3.1.1 Accessibility through tangible design
Overcoming the initial hurdle of new technology for those
living with dementia can be challenging due to a range of
different experiences (and confidence) levels, further com-
plicated by physical, cognitive, and/or mental health co-
morbidity. Following the success of tangible approaches to
interaction found in reviews of ADMIs[11] and wider art
objects [39, 38, 37], we avoided screen based and obvious
computer oriented interactions where possible. We found
this approach widely fostered within the ADMI community
[45, 44, 19].
Materials and objects speak volumes, which can be handy
for those without a manual. We attempted to remove con-
founding language provided by obvious sensor layers [34],
and invited interaction through familiar and safe materials
[35]. We found the use of playful and inviting devices that
promoted risk-free tangible interaction though design suc-
cessful in overcoming initial barriers to interaction. We have
had success building from robust natural materials and in-
corporating inviting tactile surfaces such as varnished wood
or silky fabric. Our intentions were to provoke and suggest
interaction with technology based on understandings of the
natural world.
3.1.2 Promote obvious interaction
Digital interfaces by nature can quickly become overwhelm-
ing due to their reliance on epistemic knowledge [28]. Clasper
[1], writing as a person living with dementia, reflects on the
progression of cognitive decline and it’s increasing challenge
to interactions with devices such as TV remote controls, ra-
dios and CD players.
We suggest controls should be minimal and suggest ob-
vious interactions as effectively demonstrated in [33]. We
activity tried to remove interactions based on epistemic un-
derstandings and prioritise ones that borrow from the tacit
and the phenomenological. This was achieved through the
use of culturally known tangible forms [17] which incorpo-
rate gesture and interaction strategies to enable the ability
to borrow from a lifetime of tacit knowledge.
Incorporating sensibilities of enactive design fostered within
NIME literature [6, 46, 32] has the potential to enable users
to borrow from familiar ‘choreographies’ [40] and interac-
tion paradigms. Interface controls can reinforce, and be
reinforced by the overall instruments design and wider con-
text [22]. Through our involvement activities we found com-
bining the first two considerations in objects that provoked
playful interaction and explained their use through common
metaphors successful: handles that could only be wound, a
large arcade button that invited pressing, long throw sliders
incorporated into a ‘mixing-desk’ analogy. This approach is
also well exemplified in the ‘Hug’ or ‘Steering wheel’ multi-
sensory interfaces reviewed in [39].
3.1.3 Player centred multi-modal feedback
Feedback is a benchmark of interaction, and potentially
even more important when working with this demographic
due to notions of confidence and autonomy. In group (or
even individual) music making situations, purely sonic recog-
nition of interaction can be lost in the noise. Successful in-
teractions should be sign posted and clearly demonstrate a
response. This need is highlighted in the desires of partici-
pants living with a range of physical and cognitive abilities
reviewed in [26], where additional bi-modal feedback chan-
nels were specifically requested to support interaction.
As highlighted by Ward [45] in her work with participants
with complex needs, due to potential impairment of some
sensory channels, designing feedback is a unique, person
centred, multi-modal activity that should be informed by
the instrument, the player and the situation.
Through our involvement activities we found rewarding
user input with both auditory and visual cues to be success-
ful. In many cases when we deactivated the visual cue the
remaining sonic cue was missed, and the particular control
quickly abandoned.
3.1.4 Provide extension without adding complexity
Building a relationship with a musical instrument tradition-
ally takes time and the development of motor skill. Both of
these elements can be uniquely problematic for those living
with dementia, necessitating the need not just for assistive
technology, but the right technology, designed specifically
for the user and context of use [36].
Fostering enaction through design and rewarding inter-
action with feedback is the start of a musical experience,
but from here the experience should develop and provide
reward, and often some challenge. MacRitchie [26] found
increasing the complexity of musical timing could provided
greater reward, however some of our stakeholders warn in-
creasing challenge for those within declining conditions is
not always the answer, and for some can trigger have a neg-
ative response to the experience.
Ward [45] also reflects on similar notions of expression
and constraint, recommending making experiences scale-
able and configurable using dynamic interfaces.
3.1.5 Provide a safe and intuitive escape
Interactions have the potential to cause anxiety and at times
can place some users in distress. We have observed this in
a range of ways from reactions to songs in playlists, to in-
dividuals becoming self conscious of their role in a group
setting, or simply because the stimulus or interaction be-
comes overwhelming.
To address this while providing agency and independence
to users, we have trialed a safe stop control that is clearly
signposted and tested by users early in the development of
their relationship with a device.

4. IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES
The following three examples illustrate our journey toward
dementia friendly digital musical instruments.
4.0.1 The ‘In C’ Box
The In C Box (fig.1) is an arcade machine analogy which
enables its user/s to proceduraly generate a composition us-
ing Terry Riley’s score, In C. Each of the coloured buttons
represents a musical voice, whose part is advanced one cell
in the composition each time it is pressed. A ring of LEDs
around each button provides feedback for the part playing,
as well as responding to successful interactions. The central
button is a safe stop. The devices explores notions of agency
in the composition process for those without musical train-
ing, or with cognitive or physical barriers to performance.
The In C Box embodies all 5 of our design considerations.
As a minimalist composition the piece was a great talking
point in our involvement activities, and raised some ques-
tions about musical style, preference and situation. The
idea for the SliderBox discussed below developed to address
some of these points.
Figure 2: The ‘In C’ Box
4.0.2 The Slider Box
The Slider Box (fig.2) is a ‘mixing desk’ analogy which en-
ables its user/s to combine prerecorded stems of familiar
performances to create a recognisable piece of music. The
Slider Box was designed to be used in reminiscence therapy
sessions, where the active process of selecting and combin-
ing stems of familiar music from the past creates cue points
for conversation, memories and reminiscence. The music se-
lected for inclusion can be targeted towards familiar styles
or time periods based on a knowledge of the user/s.
We wanted to borrow from known interaction metaphors
and in previous involvement activities the ‘Mixing-Desk’
was discussed as a familiar musical, technological and cul-
tural object. Within this design space, considerations were
made from visual and dextral impairment. The interface
was kept as uncluttered as possible with no additional in-
terface elements than the 8 sliders, which were spaced far-
ther apart than commonly found and later colour coded to
provide some differentiation within a repeating interface.
Figure 3: The SliderBox
4.0.3 The [...hacked] Hug
Building on the outcomes of a successful involvement activ-
ity using the Hug [39], there was a desire to make the device
more interactive. We used similar ‘Huggable’ teddies as de-
sign prototypes, and embedded a range of sensor modalities
to probe interaction as well as a more powerful speaker and
a haptic transducer to facilitate a wider range of feedback.
We explored notions of comfort and intimacy mediated
through musical and sonic interactions and uncovered the
desire for personalisation and sharing of the experience with
others.

5. CONCLUSIONS
This paper identifies a growing need for the development of
specific design theories for instruments made for those living
with dementia and cognitive decline. We have provided an
extensive review of the current provision and highlight some
interesting and successful approaches to similar challenges
from surrounding research areas. The theory behind AD-
MIs has grown greatly in the last 4 years thanks to aware-
ness and opportunity afforded through NIME research, and
we hope to play a part in extending this body of research
and aiding future designers to create empowering musical
interactions for those living with dementia.
To start the conversation, and to share our work with
the community, we propose 5 initial considerations for the
design of dementia-friendly digital musical instruments.

7. ETHICAL STANDARDS
The current work has involved multiple stakeholders in con-
sultancy and involvement activities, as set out in [3]. Con-
tact with stakeholders was made via established groups in
the community for people living with dementia. On present-
ing our research aims at regular meetings with these groups,
members who confirmed they wanted to be further involved
in our research were emailed and asked if they wanted to
participate in the subsequent involvement activities. The
activities detailed here aimed to gather opinions on the di-
rection of research and identify priorities for design rather
than to collect specific interaction data. Further stages of
the project will increase the level of engagement of stake-
holders in further co-design processes where opportunities
for deployment in diverse settings and recording of interac-
tion data will be prioritised.
