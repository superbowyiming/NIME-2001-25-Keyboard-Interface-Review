Abstract
Ventilation systems can be seen as huge examples of interfaces for
musical expression, with the potential of merging sound, space,
and human interaction. This paper explores conceptual simi-
larities between ventilation systems and wind instruments and
explores approaches to “hacking” ventilation systems with com-
ponents that produce and modify sound. These systems enable
the creation of unique sonic and visual experiences by manip-
ulating airflow and making mechanical adjustments. Users can
treat ventilation systems as musical interfaces by altering shape,
material, and texture or augmenting vents. We call for height-
ened attention to the sound-making properties of ventilation
systems and call for action (#VentHackz) to playfully improve
the soundscapes of our indoor environments.

1 Introduction
Many people spend much of their lives inside buildings under the
ever-present hum of ventilation systems. These systems serve
practical functions such as air circulation and temperature regu-
lation. However, they also contain latent acoustic potential that
can be explored creatively. The NIME community has, for years,
emphasised the use of non-traditional instruments to encourage
new forms of musical interaction [6, 8]. While ventilation sys-
tems are typically viewed as utilitarian infrastructure, they can
be explored artistically. They are, after all, sound generators with
air flowing through ducts, the hum of fans, and the vibrations
of mechanical components, forming a soundscape that may be
manipulated.
This paper explores the potential of ventilation systems as new
interfaces for musical expression using the approach of “hacking, ”
modifying existing machinery for new purposes. Involving venti-
lation systems in NIME projects introduces new ways to interact

with ambient sound, allowing users to probe the sonic oppor-
tunities these often-overlooked mechanisms offer. Our starting
point is the research question: How can a musical instrument be
created from/in a room or building?
We start by observing how a ventilation system is constructed
as a set of connected pipes, not too dissimilar from the princi-
ples of wind instruments. Then, we connect knowledge about
ventilation systems to action–sound theory [ 7], a framework
for understanding relationships between sound-producing and
sound-modifying actions in a musical context. Sound-producing
actions create sound, and sound-modifying actions alter the char-
acteristics of that sound. In the case of ventilation systems, the
airflow that passes through ducts, fans, and motors acts as the
sound-producing actions of the systems. In contrast, elements
such as adjustable vents, dampers, and architectural features can
be understood as sound-modifying elements, shaping the tonal
qualities of the sound. As a result of this dual interaction be-
tween sound production and modification, users have control
over the system’s sound in real time. This paper calls attention to
the ventilation sounds in our environments and suggests playful
approaches to improving the soundscapes through various hacks
under the label #VentHackz (media and code available online).1
2 Background
Ventilation systems—sometimes referred to as “heating, ventila-
tion, and air conditioning” (HVAC) systems—are built to maintain
indoor air quality in various settings, from residential to indus-
trial spaces. While these systems have three main functions, this
paper focuses on the one property that produces the most sound:
ventilation.
2.1 Ventilation system mechanics
Ventilation facilitates the exchange of stale and fresh air, main-
taining and regulating indoor air quality, often measured as the
CO2 level in a room. Contemporary ventilation systems can vary
in design but operate on a fundamental principle: supply vents
expel air into a room while return vents draw it back in. Figure 2
shows a ventilation system with supply and return vents. The
kinetic energy generated by the air inflow and outflow can be
used for sound production.

Many new buildings have “active” motorised ventilation sys-
tems and rely on air ducts, fans, motors, filters, and air vents, all
of which work together to facilitate airflow. However, there is a
growing interest in “passive” ventilation, the traditional approach
to creating airflow in buildings. This is a question about energy
efficiency and sustainability on one side and acoustic require-
ments and sufficient air quality on the other. There are some
1https://osf.io/enb3m/?view_only=09ef03393ef349d197fd1771b71ad9a4
examples of new concert halls built with natural or hybrid venti-
lation systems [9]. They aim to maintain low background noise
levels and meet environmental noise criteria through innovative
designs, including inline silencers, sound-absorbing materials,
and strategic use of natural air paths.
From the perspective of organology—the study of musical
instruments—ventilation systems can be likened to aerophones.
This family of instruments, such as the saxophone, produces
sound through vibrating air columns [20]. When a player blows
into the mouthpiece, the reed vibrates, generating pressure waves
that travel through the instrument’s air column. These waves
resonate within the saxophone’s body, and their frequency is
determined by the length of the air column, which is adjusted by
opening and closing the tone holes.
The saxophone’s tone holes and keys allow the player to vary
the instrument’s effective length, controlling the pitch [19]. When
a tone hole is uncovered, it creates an opening for the vibrating
air to escape, shortening the column and producing a higher
pitch. Conversely, covering a tone hole lengthens the column,
resulting in a lower pitch. This interplay of air, vibration, and
resonance lies at the heart of the saxophone’s operation.
Ventilation systems manage airflow like saxophones do (Fig-
ure 1). In a ventilation system, air circulates in and out of spaces
through a network of vents. Similarly, a saxophone’s tone holes
function as controlled air outlets. Each hole acts as a vent, al-
lowing air to escape at precise points along the instrument. Just
as the placement and size of vents in a building determine how
air moves between rooms, the arrangement and size of the sax-
ophone tone holes dictate the air column’s behaviour and the
resulting pitch.
Additionally, the player’s manipulation of the keys can be
compared to adjusting airflow in a ventilation system. One might
close specific vents in a building to redirect airflow to other ar-
eas. On the saxophone, closing a key effectively “seals” a vent,
extending the vibrating air column and lowering the pitch. On
the other hand, opening a key allows air to escape earlier, short-
ening the column and producing a higher pitch. In both cases,
the system relies on controlling openings to achieve a desired
outcome, whether air circulation or harmonious music.
2.2 Noise reduction and auditory aesthetics
Ventilation systems often produce a continuous hum or hiss,
which results from constant airflow caused by the tandem op-
eration of fan motors and compressors [ 17]. While persistent
noise can interfere with sonic experiences, such as speech intelli-
gibility or musical clarity, the acoustic properties of ventilation
systems occupy a contested space between nuisance and aes-
thetic potential. Environmental noise has long been framed as
a technical problem to solve. Fluctuating levels during system
operation (e.g., when airflow is ramping up or down) create an
inconsistent sound environment, amplified by air ducts transmit-
ting noise between rooms and structural vibrations propagating
low-frequency tones.
This framing, however, overlooks decades of artistic and the-
oretical engagement with noise as an aesthetic medium. Since
Luigi Russolo’s 1913 manifesto “The Art of Noises, ” which cele-
brated mechanical and industrial sounds as music, designers and
composers have investigated noise’s capacity to shape spatial
and emotional experience [ 18]. With their inherent rhythmic
and textural qualities, ventilation systems sit at the centre of this
VentHackz: Exploring the Musicality of Ventilation Systems NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia
discourse: their hums and hisses can be attenuated for functional
comfort or creatively amplified as site-specific sonic identity.
Practical noise-reduction methods include soundproofing ven-
tilation ducts with linings or installing silencers within the venti-
lation system to reduce noise levels [15]. Sound-absorbing ma-
terials prevent noise from escaping into the room, such as in
VentHack #1 illustrated in Figure 3, which will be discussed later.
Similarly, installing vibration isolators or reinforcing the mounts
of ventilation equipment can reduce structure-borne noise by
preventing low-frequency vibrations from transmitting through
the building. Selecting low-noise fans and motors for the venti-
lation system can help mitigate noise. Variable-speed fans can
operate more quietly by adjusting speed to meet thermostat or
CO2 demands rather than running at full power all the time.
Proper design of airflow paths by avoiding sharp turns in the
ventilation ducts can help smooth turbulence and reduce noise.

Sound-masking systems can control overall ambient noise lev-
els [22], producing electronic sound that blends with HVAC noise
to create a consistent soundscape and reduce noise perception.
Active noise cancellation systems can also reduce ventilation
noise by propagating an out-of-phase sound wave into the space
[12]. These technical interventions need not preclude aesthetic ex-
perimentation. Ventilation systems have a history of modification
to produce harmonious tones and musical sounds. The Seattle
Central Library’s ventilation system creates a subtle, ambient
soundscape [11]. Additionally, Fraunhofer IBP has experimented
with sound-controlled window ventilation, automating window
opening based on noise levels.2
2.3 Improving visual aesthetics
While essential for indoor air quality, ventilation systems often
disrupt a room’s visual harmony. Exposed vents and ductwork
can appear industrial, stark, or invasive, clashing with the room’s
aesthetic. To address the visual disruption caused by the appear-
ance of exposed vents and ductwork, homeowners and designers
use creative solutions such as decorative ventilation covers, wall-
paper overlays, and smart interior design. These approaches
conceal unsightly elements and blend them into the room’s decor
without compromising their function.

ventilation.html
2.4 Artistic use of ventilation systems
Church organs may be the musical instruments that most closely
resemble the size and functionality of ventilation systems [19].
While inspiring, organs are custom-built for musical purposes,
are not commonly available, and are out of topic for the current
project.
The idea of transforming the environment into a musical in-
strument has been explored in art installations. Zimoun creates
large-scale sound installations using simple materials and me-
chanical elements.3 Similarly, Imao Takuma’s “Work With” series
repurposes air conditioning systems as sound generators, treat-
ing infrastructures like the Kiyosu City Haruhi Art Museum as
frameworks for acoustic intervention. By altering airflow, valve
operations, or sensor inputs, Imao’s work temporarily transforms
ventilation systems into collaborators. 4 His installations fore-
ground the entanglement of system logic and artistic agency,
inviting visitors to perceive buildings as resonant entities.
Other precedents include the “Singing Ringing Tree” in Eng-
land, a 10-foot-tall Aeolian harp sculpture producing tones as the
wind passes through its pipes.5 In spas and wellness hotels, de-
signers manage ventilation and ambient noise to create sonically
relaxing atmospheres, sometimes using sound healing frequen-
cies [4], a principle that can extend to building ventilation.
Few examples exist in the literature on artistic ventilation
hacking. Some installations use blowing air [2], motorised com-
ponents [10], or architectural features [ 13] to modify musical
expression. One of the most relevant examples is Max Neuhaus’s
“Times Square” installation from 1977 [5], where he placed elec-
tronic sound generators and a loudspeaker within a ventilation
shaft. The piece produces a rich, harmonic sound texture resem-
bling the after-ring of large bells, changing in pitch, timbre, and
tone as people move around the area.
3 Principles of ventilation hacking
Our approach is based on accepting that a ventilation system is
needed to ensure good air quality in a space and thinking about
its construction and the airflow as an instrument, producing mul-
tisensory, interactive experiences emphasising the connection
between sound and space. This section describes a ventilation
system’s sound-producing and sound-modifying parts, as well as
the possibilities and limitations of what an end user in a room
can modify (Figure 4).
3.1 Sound production
Ventilation systems generate sound through airflow, mechanical
components, and structural elements. Motors driving fans and
compressors form the foundation, producing vibrations and tonal
hums. Fan rotation adds sonic layers, with blade design, speed,
and airflow patterns shaping pitches and harmonics [14].
Airflow is a primary sound mechanism when directed through
elements like reeds, plates, or ducts. This resembles aerophones
and how wind instruments produce sound through controlled
airflow to create vibrations, resonance, and pitch. [21]. The inter-
action of airflow with physical structures shapes sonic qualities.
Adjustable vents, dampers, or variable-speed fans can modify
tonal characteristics and intensity, offering users control over
sound output.

Figure 4: Possible implementation points for VentHackz.
Ducts contribute to a spectrum of sounds, from steady hums to
turbulent whooshes, depending on airflow velocity and volume.
Mechanical vibrations from components like dampers or slats
can resonate with airflow, producing harmonics.
3.2 Sound modification
Ventilation sound can be shaped and refined to achieve desired
acoustic effects. Creating sound mazes by installing diffusers,
baffles, or louvres within the ducts disrupts turbulent airflow,
helps reduce harsh noise, and shapes tonal qualities. 6 This is
comparable to how mutes or resonators in a musical instrument
alter sound output to refine its timbre and character.
Acoustic foam or other sound-absorbing materials can be ap-
plied within ducts to dampen vibrations and limit resonance.
Their mass, absorption, or stiffness can filter out extra noise.
Structural modifications to duct size, shape, or material allow
precise sound control. Resonance chambers or narrowed duct
segments can amplify specific harmonics, likening the system to
a tuned instrument.
Controllable mechanisms like adjustable dampers and vents
enable real-time sound modulation, letting users alter tonal char-
acteristics, harmonics, and intensity, similar to organ stops. Dif-
ferent materials, such as metals or composites, enhance acoustic
versatility: metal ducts produce bright, resonant tones, while
composites yield warmer, softer sounds.
Architectural design can amplify or attenuate ventilation sounds.
Airflow against perforated surfaces, tuned chambers, and mov-
able components lets structures shape soundscapes, creating
evolving tones, rhythms, and harmonics that respond to airflow
or environmental changes. Even subtle shifts in material, shape,
and surface texture significantly impact timbre [1].
3.3 External factors as sound modifiers
External conditions also serve as natural sound modifiers for ven-
tilation systems. Wind interacting with outdoor vents introduces
tonal shifts, adding variability and movement to the soundscape.
Temperature and humidity affect ventilation inflow and outflow.
Sensors, such as temperature or CO2 detectors, further en-
hance the system’s adaptability. By adjusting airflow based on
occupancy, activity levels, or environmental factors, the system
6https://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0030/196194/18.00-
Mechanical-Services-v18.pdf
can respond to the space’s needs in real time. This responsive-
ness creates an interactive and immersive auditory experience,
transforming ventilation systems into integral components of
the environment’s soundscape.
3.4 Social and physical constraints
Ventilation systems sit somewhere between public and private
spaces, influencing personal environments both aesthetically and
health-wise. Most people can, at best, modify the temperature
setting in a room; the operation of the ventilation system is oth-
erwise left to professionals. While ensuring safety and efficiency,
this professionalisation can lead to undemocratic decisions that
overlook end-users’ experiences and opinions. Consequently,
users remain unaware of simple yet impactful improvements to
enhance ventilation aesthetics and functionality. This dynamic
limits individual creativity and agency within the built envi-
ronment due to institutional and cultural constraints. As part
of a building’s infrastructure, ventilation systems often remain
hidden, making them “invisible” and contributing to a lack of
awareness and user engagement.
To unpack this set of constraints, we can use Michel de Certeau’s
concepts of “strategies” and “tactics” [3]. Strategies are the de-
sign choices made by authorities, while tactics are the every-
day actions individuals use to navigate and resist these con-
straints. In this context, traditional ventilation systems are part of
the “place”—fixed, stable, and controlled by authorised building
maintenance and conventional design. When users engage with
these systems, modifying them with lighting and acoustic treat-
ment, they transform them into “spaces”—dynamic environments
shaped by human interaction. This transformation affords fluid-
ity and adaptability in the built environment, enabling everyday
actions to reshape and redefine it. Here, tactics and infrastructure
become entangled: the improvisational, subversive acts of the
user (tactics) do not merely oppose the predetermined frame-
works (strategies) but intertwine with them, creating hybrid
forms of agency.
4 Examples of user-friendly VentHackz
It is possible to conduct ventilation hacks within user constraints.
Figure 5 shows a collection of VentHackz implemented by the
authors. These include a series of ventilation augmentations,
mechanical hacks, and digital hacks.
4.1 Augmented vents
As the internal mechanics of ventilation systems typically fall
outside users’ expertise, creative modifications can instead focus
on augmenting vents within rooms. This can be achieved by
adding structures like sound mazes from the ventilation ducts,
allowing the ventilation to protrude organically into the living
space. Like an organism growing out of the wall, these exten-
sions can introduce new acoustic and aesthetic properties while
maintaining airflow. Users can personalise their environment by
treating the ventilation as a dynamic element interacting with
the room’s interior, merging functionality with aesthetic prefer-
ence. This approach respects the professional boundaries of the
system’s core mechanics while empowering users to enhance
their space meaningfully.
VentHack #1: The sound maze concept for augmented vents
involves constructing a wall-extending structure through which
the ventilation ducts travel in a maze-like pattern (Figure 5k).
These ducts, made from thin plastic, take several turns within
VentHackz: Exploring the Musicality of Ventilation Systems NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia
the box lined with sound-absorbent materials (Figure 3). At first,
a sound-insulated flexible duct was used, but this maintained
the waveguide properties of the squiggled duct and channelled
the sound along the duct instead of dispersing through it into
the surrounding sound-absorbent materials. Allowing the air to
navigate through this sound-absorbing maze creates a quieter
and more aesthetically integrated ventilation system within the
living space without modifying the off-limits structural place of
the building’s ventilation structure.
VentHack #2: The multifunctional augmented vents concept
creates augmented ventilation structures that integrate venti-
lation, lighting, and acoustic treatment (Figure 5b). Instead of
traditional dropped ceilings or wall-mounted lights, these protru-
sions act like multifunctional boxes that attach to existing vents
without altering the off-limits structure, offering improved acous-
tics and a visually cohesive design while maintaining airflow.
This approach transforms ventilation into a versatile element
enhancing both functionality and aesthetics. These augmenta-
tions challenge conventional classifications as they do not neatly
fit into categories such as building infrastructure, light instal-
lations, furniture, or decoration. Instead, they occupy a liminal
space, blending elements of each category to create an accessible,
user-friendly, multifunctional extension.
4.2 Mechanical hacks
While the primary goal of noise control in ventilation systems
often focuses on dampening sounds to achieve silence, this ap-
proach may not suit everyone’s preferences. Some individuals
find complete silence unsettling and prefer a certain ambient
noise level. Rather than merely silencing these systems, we can
explore ways to transform the typically annoying and tiresome
noises into more aesthetically pleasing background sounds.
The simplest hacks involve directly attaching a sound-modifying
object to the return (pulling air) or supply (pushing air) vents.
These hacks rely on air pressure differentials in the ventilation
system while it runs. Additionally, different materials and shapes
interfering with airflow yield notable changes in sound.
VentHack #3: The return vents provided enough pull to hold
lightweight material without glue or additional support. An A4-
sized paper was thus mounted on one of the return vents (Fig-
ure 5a). Acting as a physical filter, the paper provided a muffled
effect for the ventilation sound.
VentHack #4: Modifying the idea from the previous hack, we
held a circular piece of cardboard at the return vent (Figure 5f).
Being stiffer and less malleable than paper, it covered the duct
end less tightly and altered the ventilation sound accordingly.
VentHack #5: Next, we experimented with the lid of a frozen
pizza box, cutting one edge into multiple strips and bending every
alternate strip (Figure 5h). This allowed us to experiment with
a different material thickness, leaving the return vent partially
open and redirecting some air over the bent cardboard strips.
This sounded like wind gusts passing through trees.
VentHack #6: We pierced a square piece of dense cardboard in
the middle before mounting it on the return vent. A slight tap to
offset it from perfectly centred on the vent created a turbulence
effect resulting from air pressure differentials. The cardboard
piece was left in a perpetual state of being pushed and pulled by
the vent, creating a rattling sound as it repeatedly hit the vent.
VentHack #7: By creatively modifying the airflow dynam-
ics and ventilation openings, we attempted to emulate natural
sounds such as the gentle rustling of the wind in the trees, the
soothing flow of a river, or the melodic calls of singing birds.
In this example, a rhythmic whistle was produced by merely
altering the gap of the ventilation duct openings (Figure 5i). The
whistle produced specific notes, which could be interpreted as
being in the key of C harmonic minor. The whistle settled on
multiple octaves of C whilst fluctuating around G, Ab, B, and C
in an ornamentation-like rhythm.
VentHack #8: A kazoo-like cardboard structure was con-
structed with a thin passage for air to pass through and rattle a
paper membrane to explore the feasibility of attaching resonat-
ing constructions as attachable “mouthpieces” to the ventilation
openings. A latch could widen the opening gradually to tweak the
airflow pressure (Figure 5j). Unlike typical wind instruments, in
which air is blown, these ducts sucked air, which made a narrow
passage crucial. The resulting sound was too quiet compared to
the remaining sounds of the ventilation.
VentHack #9: Drawing inspiration from culturally significant
wind chimes, such as f ¯urin in Japan and Korean wind chimes,
which produce auditory and aesthetic effects in response to air-
flow, we explored the impact of sound, movement, and light in
ventilation systems. An initial experiment involved attaching
wind chimes to a supply vent. As air flowed through the vent,
the turbulence and periodicity inherent in the system moved the
chimes, creating a soothing soundscape.
VentHack #10: We 3D-printed custom mesh ping pong balls
and filled them with small beads (Figure 5l). The lightweight,
textured object moved with the airflow, producing a rhythmic
rattling sound when attached to the supply vent.
VentHack #11: A subsequent modification comprised a hand-
crafted honey bee sculpture made from wire and beads (Figure 5c).
Suspended from the supply vent, airflow governed the sculpture’s
motion.
VentHack #12: Following the previous hack, we introduced
a thin layer of foam to adjust the air inflow at the return vent,
thus manipulating pressure differentials, causing the sculpture
to exhibit user-controlled motion (Figure 5e).
4.3 Digital hacks
Combining VentHackz with circuitry and creative coding unlocks
new possibilities. Simple battery-powered circuits with switches
or sensors can harness the motion of air at supply or return vents
to create visual patterns or detect lighting changes in the room.
VentHack #13: To further expand on VentHack #10, an LED
light was embedded within the 3D-printed ball (Figure 5g). The
combination of airflow-induced motion and internal illumination
created a visually appealing effect, projecting patterns of light and
shadow onto the surrounding surfaces. This demonstrated how
airflow could produce both auditory and visual stimuli, easily
turning a mechanical system into a multisensory installation.
VentHack #14: To explore digital interactions, we created an
interactive system involving a light-dependent resistor (LDR), an
LED, and a speaker connected to a Bela board running a PureData
patch. The system was designed to react to light levels. When
the room lights were turned off, the LDR activated the circuit,
triggering the LED and speaker to emit Morse code signalling the
word “HELP. ” This exploration introduced a context-aware layer
to the system, combining the ventilation structure with light and
sound (Figure 5d).
These hacks show how ventilation systems can be used as in-
teractive and immersive interfaces. Sound, motion and light with
analogue and digital interventions have the potential to enhance

indoor spaces. These explorations draw upon the legacy of wind
chimes while leveraging contemporary fabrication techniques
and programmable systems.
4.4 Audio analysis
Figure 6 shows spectrograms of how three simple VentHackz
can dramatically alter the sound in the space. These sounds were
recorded in an office with one supply vent and two return vents
(Figure 6a). Figure 6b shows the frequency content of usual ven-
tilation sound, which is heavy on low frequencies and presents
a relatively consistent progression through a 10-second time
interval. Figure 6c is for VentHack #6. With a square piece of
cardboard covering one of the return vents of the same system,
we achieved a constant rattling sound of air pressure differentials
that caused the cardboard to move and hit against the ventilation
surface repeatedly. In the spectrogram, some other frequencies
become more dominant. Finally, Figure 6d and e are two varia-
tions of VentHack #7. After closing one return vent and altering
the tightness of the other return vent, it was possible to get two
completely different soundscapes, as shown in the spectrograms.
5 Discussion
Ventilation systems can be viewed as NIMEs that blend sound,
space, and human agency. They are like large-scale, building-
sized musical instruments with sound-producing and sound-
modifying objects. The sound output of these systems can give
way to new forms of embodied interaction, where the physical
manipulation of airflow and mechanical components generates
new sonic and visual experiences.
Over the last year, we have explored ventilation hacking in
various workshops, and it has been the topic of a public seminar.
Several hacks have been tested in practice (as described above),
while others have only been developed conceptually. Several
suggestions have been made for developing interactive venti-
lation hacks to enhance engagement, offering opportunities to
create immersive environments where sound conveys informa-
tion to the user. Here, sonification can be key in communicating
contextual information, such as the time of day, through the
ventilation system’s airflow. For instance, the airflow could slow
down during lunchtime as a reminder to take a break. This subtle
auditory cue enhances awareness of daily rhythms and fosters
a connection between users and their environment. Similarly,
musification principles can help promote social or celebratory
atmospheres. For example, the system might produce a special
musical output on Friday nights.

Using gamification strategies could offer another layer of en-
gagement, where the system interacts playfully with its users.
Imagine opening a door and being greeted by a personalized
sound produced by the ventilation system—a whimsical acknowl-
edgement of movement within the space. Deliberately designed
interactions could further encourage physical activity. Opening
the door might prompt a change in airflow, inspiring curiosity
and a sense of agency. These approaches collectively encour-
age users to view ventilation systems as interactive and creative
elements of the indoor environment.
Our approach to ventilation hacking focuses on an often over-
looked part of in-door environments, reinventing the role of
ventilation systems and expanding the boundaries of what con-
stitutes a musical instrument in contemporary practice. Intro-
ducing subtle changes in shape, material and texture to vents
makes it possible to interact with ventilation systems as a musical
interface that already constitutes a big part of our daily indoor
soundscapes. The videos of our hacks are available for viewing
in a public playlist on YouTube. 7 We invite fellow ventilation
system enthusiasts to share videos of their hacks with us and the
world using the hashtag “#VentHackz” on social media platforms.
6 Ethical Standards
Our ventilation hacks prioritise safety, ensuring air quality stan-
dards are upheld and noise levels comply with health guidelines.
