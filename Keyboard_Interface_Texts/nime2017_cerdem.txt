ABSTRACT
Biostomp is a new musical interface that relies on the use
mechanomyography (MMG) as a biocontrol mechanism in
live performance situations. Designed in the form of a stomp
box, Biostomp translates a performer’s muscle movements
into control signals. A custom MMG sensor captures the
acoustic output of muscle tissue oscillations resulting from
contractions. An analog circuit ampliﬁes and ﬁlters these
signals, and a micro-controller translates the processed sig-
nals into pulses. These pulses are used to activate a step-
per motor mechanism, which is designed to be mounted on
parameter knobs on eﬀects pedals. The primary goal in de-
signing Biostomp is to oﬀer a robust, inexpensive, and easy-
to-operate platform for integrating biological signals into
both traditional and contemporary music performance prac-
tices without requiring an intermediary computer software.
In this paper, we discuss the design, implementation and
evaluation of Biostomp. Following an overview of related
work on the use of biological signals in artistic projects, we
oﬀer a discussion of our approach to conceptualizing and
fabricating a biocontrol mechanism as a new musical inter-
face. We then discuss the results of an evaluation study
conducted with 21 professional musicians. A video abstract

Biomonitoring systems oﬀer a vast range of applications for
observing various functions of the human body. While most

been used in arts as a control mechanism. In this paper, we
discuss the design and implementation of one such appli-
cation, named Biostomp, where we utilize mechanomyogra-
phy to augment the control space of a musical performer by
translating the oscillations from naturally-occurring mus-
cle activity during a performance into control signals that
manipulate various eﬀects that are commonly used by mu-
sicians.
A mechanomyogram is a low-frequency mechano-acoustic
signal generated by contractions in muscle ﬁbres [6, 18]. The
monitoring of mechanomyograms, known as mechanomyo-
graphy (MMG), is most commonly used in medical appli-
cations such as prosthetic control, and the study of mus-
cle disorders and fatigue. With Biostomp, we exploit the
mechanical nature of MMG as a means to extract the un-
mediated byproduct of muscle activities inherent to a mu-
sical performance. We have adopted a stomp box model in
our design to alleviate the complexity of a computer-based
setup, which is often found in biocontrol systems. Our sys-
tem is designed as a plug-and-play tool that does not require
extra conﬁguration or calibration beyond what is common
to stomp box eﬀects pedals.
Biostomp comprises of a custom MMG sensor that is at-
tached to the performer with an armband. The signals from
the sensor are passed to the stomp box, which houses a
circuitry to amplify, ﬁlter, and interpret the MMG signals.
The processed signals are then used to activate a motor that
controls parameter knobs on eﬀects pedals, such as those for
delaying and overdriving an instrument signal. We have de-
signed an adjustable motor mounting system that can easily
be attached to knobs on most eﬀects pedals.
Biostomp augments the musician’s control over existing
parameters of a performance setup in various scenarios. In
its primary use, the system listens to the biosignals that
occur during a musician’s regular performance, and maps
these to the control of parameters on eﬀects pedals. But
the musician can also engage in an extended performance
where they actively control these parameters with conscious
muscle movements beyond what their usual interaction with
their instruments would mandate. In addition to such pri-
mary uses of the system, Biostomp also provides a separate
audio output for the processed biosignals, which facilitates
the use of the system as a stand-alone instrument.
We conducted a user evaluation study to explore how
augmenting the control space of a performer by interpreting
MMG signals aﬀects the performance, to what extent the
performer feels in control of the resulting changes, and to
what extent these changes are considered to be desirable in
a musical context. In doing so, we aimed to evaluate the
optimal applications of the proposed system, and delineate
a road-map for the future development of our platform.

2. RELATED WORK
Scientiﬁc investigation of signals internal to the human body
dates back to the physician Luigi Galvani’s discovery ofani-
mal electricity in 1791; biomonitoring mechanisms has since
been a prominent component of medical research [12]. The
stethoscope, for instance, is a well-known application in this
ﬁeld.
The use of biosignals in arts, however, has a relatively
recent history. In one of the ﬁrst works to utilize such sig-
nals, the composer Alvin Lucier used EEG sensors placed
on his scalp to pickup alpha waves that the brain generates
under a focused state. Premiered in 1965, his work Music
for Solo Performer relied on this technique for the control
of actuators attached to instruments [8].
In 1980, the artist Stelarc introduced his workThird Hand,
which used EMG signals captured from his abdominal and
leg muscles to control a mechanical hand attached to his
right hand. This work was initially intended as a semi-
permanent prosthesis but was re-purposed as a performance
device due to the discomfort caused by the apparatus. Ac-
cording to the artist, the artwork has“contributed to cyborg
discourses on the body”.1
In the early 1990s, the artist Atau Tanaka drew attention
to the use of biosignal interfaces in performance art. He
was the ﬁrst artist to be comissioned to work withBioMuse,
which is a multi-sensor biocontrol system ﬁrst developed by
R. Benjamin Knapp and Hugh Lusted in 1988. This sys-
tem was able to monitor and transmit electroencephalogram
(EEG), electrooculography (EOG) and electromyography
(EMG) signals. A year after the introduction of BioMuse,
Tanaka co-founded the Sensorband, a trio of musicians who
use bioelectric sensors, with Zbigniew Karkowski and Ed-
win van der Heide [2]. The artist describes his work in this
medium as a “corporeal activation of sound” that can not
only decode experimental performance, but also oﬀer “an
entry point to possible intimate spaces created by digital
interaction” [15]. BioMuse project was later developed into
a brand that consisted of various consumer-oriented biocon-
trol devices.
The artist Marco Donnarumma coined the term“biophys-
ical music” [4] in 2011, following the development of his
Xth Sense device, which is an MMG-based sensor system
that captures biological sounds. Xth sense comprises of an
MMG sensor armband and a hardware ampliﬁcation unit;
the hardware is coupled with a custom software that en-
ables mapping, ﬁltering and sound-processing. The artist
uses the device in his performance art pieces, where his
body becomes the primary sound source.
In 2014, Thelmic Labs released a consumer version of
their armband EMG sensorMYO, which is a general-purpose
gesture controller. Accompanied by a variety of software
products, MYO is marketed as a cross-platform biocontrol
interface. It relies on the use of pre-deﬁned arm and hand
gestures to activate certain software commands. For in-
stance, in the MYO Control App, making a ﬁst opens the
menu, and spreading ﬁngers launches an application.
3. BIOSTOMP
Biostomp aims to integrate biocontrol into musical perfor-
mance. Initially developed for guitarists, Biostomp can be
useful for any performer who utilizes eﬀects pedals in their
music. Additionally, the audio output capabilities of our
system enables its use as a standalone instrument, in which
the muscle sounds themselves act as a sound source.
Stomp boxes often comprise a toggle switch for turning
the eﬀect on or oﬀ, permanently mapped parameter con-
1http://stelarc.org/?catID=20265
trol knobs, an audio input, and an audio output for the
processed signal. Our primary design consideration with
Biostomp was to capture the simplicity of this model and
achieve an unmediated connection between biosignals and
the parameters these can be used to control. Most biosignal
systems used in artistic projects communicate with a com-
puter software that generates or manipulates sounds. In
such cases, the computer can be considered as the sound-
producing instrument. The computer can also be used as an
intermediary when using biosignals to control external me-
chanical sound sources. While this approach oﬀers precise
monitoring and intricate mapping of biosignals, putting an
extra layer between the performer and the instrument can
be undesirable in live performance situations.
Biostomp is a self-contained system that does not require
a software interface or external calibration beyond what is
presented on its physical interface. The system therefore
acts as an analogous mediator that is capable of mechani-
cally manipulating hardware signal processing devices, such
as eﬀects pedals, with biosignals generated during a musical
performance.
Biostomp relies on MMG acquisition for translating mus-
cle activity into control signals. MMG is most commonly
compared to electromyogram (EMG), which represents the
electrical potential of muscle activity [12]. The hardware
and signal processing components of an EMG acquisition
system is often technically complicated and expensive to
manufacture [1, 6]. Furthermore, EMG sensors have a noisy
response under low muscle activity [19], and are sensitive to
environmental factors, such as power line interference [7],
electro-magnetic pollution [16], and perspiration [11]. Ad-
ditionally, EMG signals detected by surface electrodes take
place prior to muscle activation in the sensorimotor sys-
tem ﬂow [5] whereas mechanical vibrations picked up by an
MMG sensor are generated upon the force production. This
implies that control signals acquired with an EMG sensor
precede the actual muscle activity. While this makes EMG
particularly useful in certain applications, such as prosthetic
limb systems, it masks the eﬀect of, for example, physical
muscle fatigue, which can be utilized as a meaningful com-
ponent of a musical performance. Finally, when compared
to EMG signals, MMG signals are less sensitive to place-
ment of the sensor over the muscle [17]; this allows MMG
sensors to be placed more freely over certain muscle regions
and makes them less susceptible to shifts in placement dur-
ing monitoring. Fig. 1 shows the components and operation
scheme of Biostomp.

3.1 Sensor Design
An MMG sensor, an air-chamber that houses this sensor,
seen in Fig. 2, and an armband that holds these components
in place, seen in Fig. 3, are the principal components of
66

band
Biostomp’s MMG extraction mechanism.
The frequency of core muscle vibrations range from sin-
gle digit values to approximately 45 Hz [10] with that of
superﬁcial muscle contractions go up to 100 Hz [3]. While
industrial measurement microphones, such as the Microtech
Gefell’s MK250, can oﬀer a frequency response of 3.5 Hz
to 20 KHz, this is a considerably wider range than that
is necessary for our system. Instead, we used a Kingstate
KECG2742PBL-A electret condenser microphone, which is
suggested as being ideal for MMG applications in a com-
parative study conducted by Donnarumma et al. [5].
Previous research describes ideal speciﬁcations for MMG
sensor and air-chamber designs: Watakabe et al. [18] tested
several dimensions for cylindrical air-chambers and recom-
mended a diameter of at least 10mm and a height of 15mm,
pointing out the correlation between slight changes in this
dimension and frequency response. Silva and Chau [14] pro-
posed the use of a microphone-accelerometer composite sen-
sor with a cylindrical air chamber of 1.3cm in diameter and
0.2cm in height, sealed with a silicone membrane, which
provides the highest signal-to-noise ratio. Posatsky [13] in-
vestigated multiple designs with both cylindrical and coni-
cal air chambers and found that cones oﬀer a higher average
gain of 6.79 +/-1.06 dB/Hz in low frequencies, in compari-
son to cylindrical air-chambers.
To achieve ﬂexibility in where the sensor can be placed
on the body, instead of a small silicon-based enclosure, we
adopted the air-chamber design by the researcher Martin
Ma, who proposed the use of wider dimensions for monitor-
ing large muscle regions rather than individual muscles [20].
We modelled this proposal in a 3D design environment (see
Figure 3: The armband that houses the sensor
Fig. 2) and used oil-based plastic acrylonitrile-butadiene
styrene (ABS) as our base material. This is a tough-yet-
lightweight material appropriate for molding robust objects
for everyday use.
3.2 Circuit Design
The electret microphone is powered via a 12V regulated
circuit; its output is ampliﬁed with a 2-gain-staged high-
quality audio preamp, designed by Rod Elliot. 2 Note that
in our system, the R7 resistor is modiﬁed with a 4.7 kOhm
resistor to achieve a total gain of 12.9 db.
Based on the frequency range to be monitored with the
MMG sensor, a 5th-order low-pass Butterworth ﬁlter in a
Sallen Key topology with a cut-oﬀ frequency at 100 Hz is
used. From the ﬁlters we experimented with, the cut-oﬀ
slope and the pass-band characteristics of this design pro-
vided us with an optimal noise elimination. OPA27 opera-
tional ampliﬁers were preferred due to their low-noise and
high-precision stability characteristics.
The ﬁltered signal is passed to a Msgeq7 equalizer IC,
which is a CMOS chip that provides a DC representation of
the amplitudes of 7 ﬁxed frequency bands. In our case, we
only use the ﬁrst band, which has a center frequency of 63
Hz. We also implemented a signal path for the AC signal
to allow for the direct monitoring of the audio signal.
Figure 4: Biostomp enclosure
Upon detection of a consistent hum in our ﬁrst prototype,
we switched from a plastic enclosure to a metal one, as seen
in Fig. 4. The conductive enclosure works as a local earth
and oﬀers shielding from electromagnetic interference [9].
A sensitivity knob attached to a 100-kOhm potentiometer
enables the control of the preamp’s gain. A 3PDT foot-
switch is used for switching between motor control or audio
output. When the audio output is not used, this foot-switch
eﬀectively turns oﬀ Biostomp.
3.3 Motor System
Envelope following of the band-limited 20Hz-to-63Hz signal
is sent to one of the analog inputs on the micro-controller,
in this case an Arduino Nano. Further smoothing, scal-
ing and mapping is applied to the digital signal. An A4988
driver board is used before the motor for pulse transmis-
sion, current adjustments, and over-heating protection. A

4. USER EV ALUATION
A user evaluation was conducted to explore the responsive-
ness of Biostomp, and its ease of use for musicians who may
or may not be experienced in incorporating digital control
interfaces into their performances.
4.1 Preliminary Study
To evaluate our ﬁrst prototype ofBiostomp, we conducted a
preliminary study with 11 guitar players between the ages
of 25 and 45. Two primary issues that surfaced in this
study were the lack of ease in mounting the sensors, and
the discomfort caused by the armband during performance.
Furthermore, the participants reported an inconsistent re-
lationship between their activities and the audible outcome
of the device’s interpretation of these activities. Such feed-
back prompted us to revise the wearable components of our
system to improve comfort during performance. Further-
more, we revised the grounding and ampliﬁcation schemes
in our circuitry, which helped eliminate some of the noise
that impacted the sense of correlation between the bodily
movements and the changes in audio eﬀects negatively.
4.2 Method
After revising our system based on the results of the prelim-
inary study, we conducted a primary study with 21 profes-
sional musicians, which included 13 guitar players, 1 trum-
pet player, 1 violinist, 1 keyboard player, 3 percussionists, 1
drummer, and 1 custom electronic instrument player. 11 of
the participants reported limited experience with new mu-
sical interfaces, with 4 participants reporting no experience
whatsoever. The remainder of the participants reported ex-
perience with a range of interfaces, such as Arudunio-based
sensor systems, MIDI keyboard and controllers, tablets,
computer software, and natural interaction devices like the
Microsoft Kinect and the Leap Motion. The styles of music
performed by the participants included classical, folk, jazz,
free improvisation, rock, noise, and ambient.
The study took 30 minutes on average. After a brief ver-
bal description of the system, the users were given a period
of time to warm up. The sensitivity of the monitoring was
then adjusted for the individual performer. This was fol-
lowed by a performance, which was recorded audio-visually
and lasted 15 minutes on average. Each performer used
the system to control the delay time parameter on a delay
pedal, and the drive parameter on a fuzz/distortion pedal.
The participants were than asked to ﬁll out a 15-question
survey, which consisted of 10 linear scale questions asking
users to rate diﬀerent aspects of their experience usingBios-
tomp, as well as 4 open-ended writing prompts, and 1 mul-
tiple choice question asking users which of the eﬀects (i.e.
delay or drive) was preferred.
4.3 Results & Discussion
Fig. 6 shows the distribution of responses to the 10 linear
scale questions about various aspects of their experience
performing with Biostomp.
While it was left up to the performers to decide whether
they would let the system accompany their regular perfor-
mance, or if they would extend their playing with deliberate
muscle movements, users reported the armband gave them
an awareness of the system that they wanted to “play into”
regardless of their approach. While most users reported
switching back and forth between regular and extended per-
formances, one user described that, in addition to his nor-
mal guitar playing, he contracted his biceps to the rhythm
of the tune; this is an interesting in-between approach that
maintains a regular performance but augments it with extra
embodied controls. This can be resembled to a performer’s
tapping of a foot to the rhythm of his or her playing; such an
activity is often a natural bodily expression that can serve
as a means of timekeeping. While such expressions would
not eﬀect the sound output directly, in this case, Biostomp
translates these expressions into variations in sound, oﬀer-
ing a new degree of freedom.
The users reported that they felt a signiﬁcant potential for
improving their control over the system with more practice,
implying that the system can be capable of aﬀording varying
degrees of virtuosity. In accordance with this, most users
indicated that their ability to predict the system’s eﬀect
has noticeably improved over time. One user stated that
once they ﬁgured out the limits of the parametric changes
enabled by the system, their control over it signiﬁcantly im-
proved. These results imply an ability to gain expertise with
Biostomp, which can contribute to its long-term integration
into performance practices.
Out of the two eﬀects the participants performed with,
there was a preference towards the control of the delay pa-
rameter (62%) than that of the drive parameter (38%). De-
spite this result, multiple users reported feeling more in con-
trol of the drive parameter. Other users expressed that the
sense of contracting a muscle was more analogous with the
audible eﬀect of the drive pedal rather than that of the de-
lay pedal. This indicates an embodied relationship between
the variations in physical eﬀort and sound dynamics, which
is a rather intuitive relationship that is often observed with
acoustic instruments. When asked about which eﬀects pa-
rameters they thought would be suitable for controlling with
Biostomp besides the ones they performed with during the
study, users listed size parameter on reverberation eﬀects,
cut-oﬀ frequency on EQ and WAH pedals, depth and time
parameters on ﬂanger and phaser pedals, and pitch value
on pitch-shift pedals.
While most of the participants described their movements
and the resulting changes in eﬀects to be coherent, they
have also suggested that personalizing the experience by
using diﬀerent eﬀects pedals, and attaching the sensor to
other limbs could help improve the sense of coherence. One
of the users expressed that one of the most engaging as-
pects of their experience with the system was ﬁguring out
its eﬀect on their playing, and added that it wouldn’t be
68
as expressive if it was entirely predictable. Another partici-
pant noted that the unexpected outcomes have surprisingly
aﬀected their performance in a positive way. This is appar-
ent in Fig. 6 (b) and (c), which imply that while most users
acknowledged a sense of control over the system, the coher-
ence between their performance and the resulting changes in
eﬀects were rated higher with a similar Likert distribution.
This could be explained through the unmediated connection
the system creates between muscle movements and param-
eter changes: although the users might not be conscious of
their muscle activity when playing their instrument, such
activity is nevertheless a part of their performance; Bios-
tomp merely maps this to an existing parameter within their
control space. By nature of its design, the system is immune
to misinterpretations, discontinuities or data loss.
The users reported the armband having a physical eﬀect
on the performance to varying degrees. While some users
described that the system did not cause any additional phys-
ical strain during their performance, others indicated that
it could get uncomfortable beyond the 15-20 minutes pe-
riod they spent with the system during the study. One
user noted that the awareness of the device forced them to
perform extra movements that might have contributed to
their sense of post-performance fatigue. In line with this,
another user stated that becoming more experienced with
the system would presumably help them be more deliber-
ate with it and therefore reduce the risk of fatigue. Another
user suggested that it might be comfortable to play with a
smaller armband; the current design of the armband has
been resembled to a blood pressure cuﬀ.
Despite the signiﬁcant variation of musical styles played
by the participants, nearly all of them expressed that play-
ing with Biostomp would be compatible with their style.
While psychedelic rock, free improvisation and experimen-
tal music were the most commonly listed genres considered
suitable for performing with this system, the list included
more mainstream genres as well. Some users noted that the
device would be particularly useful in performances where
bodily movements are well-articulated, or more physically
expressive. One user mentioned that they would want to
compose new pieces with this system in mind, while an-
other felt the device “expanded the playground for the free
improviser.”
When asked about possible improvements to the system,
the participants requested better response times especially
with the release stage of the eﬀect; a user noted that it
occasionally became hard to decay the eﬀect before a new
activation was triggered. Some users indicated that it could
be interesting if multiple limbs were monitored to control
multiple parameters at once. Given the audio output ca-
pability of the system, one user suggested that Biostomp
could be integrated into a modular synthesizer performance
as a CV source. One of the users suggested that the sys-
tem could be used in an art-form that is more corporeally
expressive, such as theatre or performance art.
5. CONCLUSIONS
This paper introduces a new interface for augmenting mu-
sical performance with biosignals through the use of a self-
contained stomp box system that translates muscle activity
into changes in parameters on eﬀects pedals. A user study
of 21 musicians provides initial validation of the success of
Biostomp in terms of ease of use, controllability, expressive-
ness, and fatigue.
Feedback from our preliminary study guided the funda-
mental design of our system. The improved comfort and

sured a minimum threshold of musical responsiveness for
instrumentalists with a wide range of stylistic backgrounds.
In our user study, we observed an ease of adaptation during
each participant’s experimentation with the system. Some
users especially indicated that they appreciated the inti-
macy that the familiar “eﬀects pedal” presentation of Bios-
tomp provided. We observed that users who were intro-
duced to the original sound of the control signal were more
easily able to incorporate Biostomp into their performances.
Users were intrigued by the increased range of expressivity
our system enabled, and we will continue to explore and
evaluate the use of Biostomp to control a wider range of
musical eﬀects.
We believe that the overall comfort of the armband will
need to be improved for the next iteration of the hardware.
In addition to the foot-switch that shifts the signal from
motor control to audio output, and the input gain knob, we
plan to add extra control knobs (e.g. for adjusting rotation
decay time) and switches (e.g. for switching motor rotation
polarity) based on the feedback we received from musicians.
We also see a great potential in adding a DC output within
signal Eurorack standards for the integration of Biostomp
with modular synthesizers.
We hope that the results discussed here will not only help
us improve our own design, but also aid the design of new
biosignal interfaces, particularly taking into consideration
some of the issues highlighted in this study, such as the
eﬀects of mapping strategies on the embodied relationship
between the performer and the sound, the beneﬁts of ad-
hering to a performer’s existing interaction paradigm, and
the need for a range of expressiveness within which the per-
formers can improve their control over the system. Overall,
we believe that the integration of biocontrol into music per-
formance opens up a lot of possibilities for both traditional
and contemporary performance practices, and that Bios-
tomp oﬀers a notable contribution in this area.
