ABSTRACT
Many opportunities and challenges in both the control and
performative aspects of today’s modular synthesizers exist.
The user interface prevailing in the world of synthesizers and
music controllers has always been revolving around knobs,
faders, switches, dials, buttons, or capacitive touchpads, to
name a few. This paper presents a novel way of interaction
with a modular synthesizer by exploring the aﬀordances of
cord-base UIs. A special patch cable was developed us-
ing commercially available piezo-resistive rubber cords, and
was adapted to ﬁt to the 3.5 mm mono audio jack, making
it compatible with the Eurorack modular-synth standard.
Moreover, a module was developed to condition this stretch-
able sensor/cable, to allow multiple Patch-cordes to be used
in a given patch simultaneously. This paper also presents a
vocabulary of interactions, labeled through various physical
actions, turning the patch cable into an expressive controller
that complements traditional patching techniques.

1. INTRODUCTION
The comeback of the modular synthesizer as a composi-
tional and performative electronic music instrument in the
past decade has been showing increased adoption and inter-
est [12]. The decentralization provided by core standards
of modulars (1V/Octave and 5V gates) dates back to the
old Moogs. The conforming Eurorack format, originally de-
signed in 1996 by German engineer Dieter Doepfer, made
it possible to freely mix modules within a single crate [2].
This enabled various small businesses to innovate with de-
signing modules that went beyond the classical boundaries
of traditional analog synthesis while attaining an immedi-
ate market, putting the modular synthesizer back into an
experimental, yet aﬀordable, music making space. More
companies make synthesizer modules now than ever before.

Modules today vary from classical voltage-controlled oscil-
lators, ﬁlters and ampliﬁers, to novel dynamic distortion
modules and interesting sequencers that rely on mathemat-
ical algorithms such as Euclidean sequencing [16]. Digital
modules pack even more functionality than traditional ana-
log modules, although the common language in program-
ming a modular synthesizer is still based on control volt-
ages and logic gates/triggers. Whether analog or digital,
the whole point behind the modular synthesizer, and the
biggest reason with it being embraced today, lies within the
concept of “patching” [11]. Controlling such a synthesizer
from a novel interface that inspires electronic musicians has
been a subject of interest and experimentation since the
60s, starting, for example, with the innovative capacitive
touchpad inputs that Don Buchla included with his ﬁrst se-
quencer [7]. At the time, modular synthesizers became pop-
ularized by Bob Moog’s adoption of the keyboard interface
and 1V/Octave exponential oscillators and ﬁlters, making
the instrument more appealing for the average composer
and musician. The modular synthesizer of today, however,
paves the way for electronic musicians to design sounds and
compositions using a plethora of innovative techniques, de-
ﬁned by the ways in which the modules are patched to-
gether. Modulars become a hybrid instrument that high-
light a fusion of many schools of synthesis and just plainly
innovative/hacking ideas into a personal, unique and ut-
terly dynamic sonic palette. Opportunities and challenges,

of course, exist in controlling and performing with a mod-
ular synthesizer. Nominally, modular musicians don’t want
anything to vary in how their cables respond – they are
optimally thought as zero-impedance connections. This pa-
per, however, turns this concept on its head, presenting a
special type of patch cord, that allows multimodal inter-
action to be performed with a modular synthesizer – e.g.,
focusing on immediate and natural actions such as plucking,
stretching, bending, pressing, snapping, etc.

2. RELA TED WORK
2.1 Cord-like controllers
The ﬁeld of expressive controllers has been widely explored
since the 80s and early 90s [10]. The best-known early work
that utilizes cord-like interfaces is called The Web and was
originally built by Michel Waisvisz at Amsterdam’s Sticht-
ing voor Electro Instrumentale Muziek (STEIM) [9]. The
Web, inspired by spider webs, consisted of an octagonal
frame holding multiple radials and circles made out of ny-
lon and special sensors to detect the player’s physical ten-
sion. The player had access to over 24 degrees of freedom,
making it an excellent timbral controller compared to tra-
ditional controllers that can only aﬀect the pitch, velocity
and pressure of a given sound [6]. Manipuller is a more re-
cent example of a gestural controller based on a string ma-
nipulation and multi-dimensional force sensing technology
[5]. The Sonic Banana is another cord-like interface, essen-
tially a MIDI controller in the form of a ﬂexible rubber tube
that is augmented with multiple sensors to detect bending
[15]. Tangentially, the FabricKeyboard exhibits a similar
behavior to cord-like interfaces through its multimodal tac-
tile interaction. Wicaksono et al., explore a corpus of user
interactions provided by the aﬀordances of textile – inter-
actions such as stretching, pressing, and deforming, allow
expressive control to be injected into a digital patch [18].
Earlier work, such as Zstrech, explored similar interactions
without using a skeuomorphic interface like the keyboard
[8]. A user study carried out by Giovanni et al., explored
how musicians interact with stretchable controllers. From
their ﬁndings, several musicians relied on stretch and defor-
mation while playing an instrument similarly to how they
interacted with expression pedals or mod wheels on a syn-
thesizer, they are generally patched to manipulate the tim-
bre of a sound, or parameter of a time-based eﬀect, rather
than discrete notes [17].
2.2 Cords in HCI
Several projects in the ﬁeld of human-computer interaction
(HCI) explore the usage of cords as input devices. The ear-
liest and most impactful work, by Schwarz et al., demon-
strates the power of cords as an interface for controlling
music players, while exploiting the cord’s many and inter-
esting physical aﬀordances [14]. Moreover, Wimmer et al.’s
implementation, senses the user’s input at various points
of a headphone’s cord to adjust the volume through time
domain reﬂectometry [19]. Detecting knots on a rope em-
bedded with ﬂex sensors was implemented and explored by
a project called Minguet, which also connects to a smart-
phone to generate audio and visuals [13]. Moreover, Cord
UIs explored the usage of metaphors through augmenting
cords with various sensors while showing many applications
in controlling appliances. For instance, a knot presented in
the power cord of a desk lamp, turns oﬀ the light [13]. These
are but examples that showcase the distinctive explorations
of cords and their aﬀordances in the world of HCI.
2.3 Eurorack’s Patch Cables
Cables terminated in 3.5 mm mono audio jacks, known as
patch cords, are adopted by the Eurorack standard to trans-
mit signals (audio or control-voltage (CV)), from module to
module. Several companies have been evolving the patch ca-
ble while maintaining the integrity of the signal through its
zero-impedance connection. For instance, a special patch
cable, called Stackable (Figure 2), by Tiptop Audio [4], al-
lows multiple signals to be routed together similar to stack-
able banana cords (used to patch a Buchla synthesizer).
This is a very useful cable for patching a compact Eurorack
synthesizer, as it avoids the need of using a distinct signal
” multiple” module in the rack. Another series of patch ca-
bles, sold by Logsdon Audio, embed the cable with LED
that react to the signal; it is even possible to illuminate one
end with positive polarity and the opposite end with nega-
tive polarity through dual polarity LEDs [3]. The integrity
of the signal could be aﬀected by this cable if the transmit-
ting module had no buﬀered outputs, since a voltage drop
is needed to turn on the LEDs.

This paper proposes to alter the functionality of certain
traditional patch cables in a patch, sacriﬁcing the integrity
of the signal that they transmit at the expense of turning
them into expressive input devices. This paper doesn’t sug-
gest replacing entirely all the patch cables in a given patch,
rather, it pushes the player to think creatively about inter-
esting routes that could beneﬁt from having a performative
patch cable. This paper builds upon existing prior work
by demonstrating several use cases in patching a modular
synthesizer with a stretchable cable made out of a piezo-
resistive rubber cord and other commercially available and
aﬀordable components that manipulate with physical ges-
tures elements of the patch.
3. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENT A TION
3.1 Conductive Rubber Cord
The cable as an interface is based on a commercially avail-
able carbon based piezo-resistive rubber known to work well
as a stretch sensor. The cord is impregnated by carbon that
resides within the rubber, thus making it conductive. Given
the movement of electrons through the chain of carbon, a
resistance R is observed when the rubber band is at rest-
ing position. When stretched apart, the distance between
particles of carbon increases, and therefore an increase in
the resistance of the overall material is observed. The op-
posite eﬀect is noticed when the rubber cord is squished
together; the overall resistance of the material decreases.
Similar eﬀects can be registered with other interactions,
i.e., tying and pressing a knot, bending or randomly de-
forming the cord. The manufacturer speciﬁcations show
that the resistance ﬂuctuates around 350 Ohms per inch at
rest. For instance, a 6” Patch-corde has a total resistance
of about 2.1 kOhms. When stretched to about 10” , the
resistance ﬂuctuates around 3.5 KOhms. This conductive
rubber can be stretched to 50 to 70 percent of its length.
The resistance takes several milliseconds to show change as
the rubber returns to its original resting state, and that
is due to the hysteresis presented in the rubber during de-
formation. Therefore, a gradual decrease of resistance is
registered upon relaxation [1].
3.2 Cable Assembly
The following process is presented to transform a conduc-
tive rubber band into a functional patch cable that meets
the Eurorack requirements. First, crimp-connectors on both
ends of the rubber band are capsuled to securely ensure
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020
614
the transmission of signal to the audio-jack from the piezo-
resistive material. Second, an insulated cable coils around
the rubber band, transmitting the ground line, as indicated
by Figure 3. Third, two sleeves are inserted as well as two
heat-shrink tubes. The latter are used to ensure an insula-
tion between the hot signal and the ground line. Last but
not least, the crimp-connectors are solder to the inner-tip
of the mono jack, then reinforced with another heat-shrink
tube, whereas the coiled wire is soldered to the outer sleeve.
Figure 3: Patch-corde’s assembly process.
3.3 Circuit Design
To sense the change in resistance of this piezo-resistive rub-
ber band, an analog circuit consisting of two stages, a sens-
ing stage, and a gain/bias stage as shown in Figure 4, has
been developed. A current that ﬂows through the cord con-
nects to the inverting pin (V-) of a transimpedance ampli-
ﬁer (TIA). The feedback resistor was carefully selected to
maximize the voltage observed on the output terminal with-
out saturation. The second stage of the circuit constitutes
of two gain circuits. The ﬁrst adds a ﬁxed voltage boost
through a non-inverting conﬁguration, while the second al-
lows an adjustable gain using a potentiometer wired in nega-
tive feedback through the inverting pin (V-) and the output
of an inverting ampliﬁer. The op-amp in use in this circuit
is the TL23704 and is powered by +12 and -12V from the
Eurorack power buses. Finally, an envelope follower con-
nects to an LED at the output terminal to indicate signal.
Figure 4: Two stages in the conditioning circuit.
3.4 Module Design
A module compatible with the Eurorack standard was de-
signed to integrate the Patch-corde with other modules on
the modular synthesizers. The module is 10HP wide (hor-
izontal pitch) and 3U long (rack units). It includes 4 in-
stances of the circuit shown in Figure 4. The module can
operate in two modes, one using an external AC signal from
another module presented on the right side of the panel with
a regular patch cable, and the other on the left side where
the Patch-corde connects the module to any other mod-
ule in a given patch. In this conﬁguration the transmit-
ted AC signal will be aﬀected by the manipulation of the
Patch-corde, i.e., an amplitude drop in the original signal is
observed while stretching the Patch-corde. When used in a
self-patched mode, using the module’s internal DC outputs,
a dynamic DC signal is noted on the output terminals of the
module based on the Patch-corde’s state.
4. DESIGN AND INTERACTION
A single patch-corde is designed to look and feel similarly
to other patch cables in the modular synthesizer scene, and
through its form factor of a stretchy rubber band it pro-
vides a number of aﬀordances that can be explored as phys-
ical music gestures. A vocabulary of interactions is created
based on the Patch-corde for altering the output signal of
the patch through the physical manipulation of the cord. A
basic language of gestures is proposed to make use of the
stretchiness, malleability and thin/ﬂexible form factors as a
foundation for a number of expressions. Two diﬀerent dy-
namics are identiﬁed, that were applicable to how the cable
is manipulated. One dynamic refers to slowly deforming
the cable to generate small changes over time; this refers
to a continuous type of gesture performed by the player.
The second is discrete, where burst in the signal are cre-
atively used in a certain patch. Given these dynamics we
divided our interaction vocabulary in two types: continuous
vs. discrete.
Figure 5: The module’s modes of operation.
4.1 Continuous Gestures
Continuous interactions refer to gestures where the per-
former applies a constant force to the rubber band by vary-
ing the direction and amount of force in their action. The
rubber band therefore, either stretches or compresses. A
few examples of continuous interactions include: stretching,
where the cord is pulled apart in opposite directions; this
causes the resistance of the cable to increase and therefore
attenuating the signal. For instance this motion could be
used to modulate the cut-oﬀ frequency of a low pass ﬁlter.
Pressing gestures allow the performer to roll the cable and
press with a single hand, same as the rubber cord is pressed
the resistance decreases, causing the opposite eﬀect of the
stretching motion. Pinching is a variant of pressing and
consists of the ﬁne grained gesture of pressing on a given
part of the rubber cord. In continuous gestures, the resis-

tance will be kept at a constant level as long as the cable is
being either stretched or pressed – allowing the performer
to ‘hold’ on a speciﬁc output voltage and vary it by apply-
ing more force, or letting the patch cable ﬂex back to its
original state of relaxation.
4.2 Discrete Gestures
Discrete gestures are composed of momentary, short burst
actions where the performer generates spikes by quickly ma-
nipulating the patch cord. One example is plucking, where
the performer can pluck the cord in a similar motion as to
strumming a guitar or bass. This gesture will cause a quick
variation in resistance and consequently resulting with sud-
den variation in the patch. The same eﬀect can be ob-
served by hitting or patting the cable quickly. Due to their
momentary nature, the discrete gestures can work well for
rhythmic or percussive sounds that require a trigger or short
impulse. A few examples of gestures include wiggling where
the performer moves the rubber band in a zig-zag motion or
twisting where the band is quickly twisted in back and forth
motion. We have successfully implemented ﬁlters to sepa-
rately produce fast and slow gestures at separate control
outputs allowing each type of motion to control a diﬀerent
parameter.

5. FUTURE WORK
To better understand and explore the aﬀordances of using a
deformable patch cable as an input device in a given patch,
a user study could be formed that invites modular synthe-
sizers builders and hobbyists, as well as professional. On
the other hand, both the board and the face-plate could
be revised and re-designed to explore diﬀerent functional-
ity and aesthetics. Moreover, an entire new circuit design,
printed on a ﬂexible PCB, could integrate within the patch
cable itself, removing the need of having a separate module
while exhibiting similar interactions.
6. CONCLUSION
With the renaissance of the modular synthesizer in today’s
age of music making, and with the abundance of modules in
the market, the number of modular synth builders have in-
creased. Several challenges remain in providing novel ways
to controlling this personal and unique instrument. This
paper proposed a new family of patch cables, inspired by
years of research in HCI and novel music interfaces, that
rely on deformation through stretching, plucking, pressing
and other known physical interactions with cords. A vocab-
ulary of interactions was presented through use cases, and
was labeled into two categories: continuous vs discrete. Fi-
nally, a technique to developing this special patch cable was
documented, as well as a sensor conditioning circuit and a
module allowing several cables to work all at once within a
given patch.
