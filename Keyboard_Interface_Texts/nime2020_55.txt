ABSTRACT
We conducted a study which examines mappings from a rel-
atively unexplored perspective: how they are made. Twelve
skilled NIME users designed a mapping from a T-Stick to
a subtractive synthesizer, and were interviewed about their
approach to mapping design. We present a thematic analy-
sis of the interviews, with reference to data recordings cap-
tured while the designers worked. Our results suggest that
the mapping design process is an iterative process that al-
ternates between two working modes: diﬀuse exploration
and directed experimentation.

1. INTRODUCTION
Digital musical instruments (DMIs) are often composed of
independent and interoperable modular components, such
as synthesizers and controllers [9]. Considering the widespread
use of MIDI controllers, digital audio workstations, and
other commercially available music technology, it is likely
that most DMIs in use today are DMIs made from indepen-
dently designed modules. It falls to the user of these mod-
ules to make the mapping, the designed connection between
control signals and control parameters that creates the in-
terdependencies between otherwise independent parts, mak-
ing them into a whole: a musical instrument. This implies
that, of all the aspects of a DMI that must be designed, the
mapping is most likely to be designed by the music maker.
This makes the mapping design process especially crucial
to understand, because only by understanding this creative
process can tools be designed that eﬀectively facilitate it,
helping users to create mappings that serve their creative
purposes.
Given a certain DMI, changing only its mapping has a
wide range of eﬀects that fundamentally alter the instru-
ment: the mapping inﬂuences the behavior and feel of the

instrument [10], how engaging the instrument is to play [5],
and even how enjoyable it is to watch a performance with it
[3]. Because of the importance of mappings in DMI design,
they have received signiﬁcant research interest [1, 2]. Much
of this research presents mapping representations, recom-
mendations, and tools for designing mappings. Relatively
little consideration has focused on the design process itself:
how do skilled DMI designers and users devise mappings?
How do they implement them? What criteria do they use
to evaluate their implementations?
We conducted a user study to explore the mapping design
process, described in section 2. Our hypothesis is that by
directly observing skilled DMI users while they designed a
mapping and interviewing them about their approach to
this activity, we are able to gain clear insights into the way
these designers approach making mappings (section 3).
2. METHODOLOGY
2.1 Overview
The participants (N=9) were all musicians with a range of
backgrounds. All participants had at least four years (at
most 25) of experience in composing, performing, or other-
wise making music using DMIs. They were asked to take 20
to 60 minutes to design a mapping from a T-Stick to a sub-
tractive synthesizer. When they ﬁnished their mapping, or
time ran out, they were asked to demonstrate and explain
their mapping, and then they were interviewed about their
approach to the design process.
Participants were speciﬁcally asked to “create a mapping
that, according to your understanding of the words, would
be an eﬀective mapping for a live performance.” This word-
ing was chosen to encourage participants to interpret how
the mapping should be designed according to their own aes-
thetic and creative preferences; “eﬀective” by deﬁnition de-
pends on what you are trying to achieve.
Participants were required to use a T-Stick as a gestu-
ral interface, they were given a subtractive synthesizer to
make connections to, and they were asked to use Webmap-
per to create these connections. These tools were chosen for
their availability, and as representative examples of a ges-
tural control interface, sound synthesizer, and mapping de-
sign environment respectively. The T-Stick is a cylindrical
gestural controller originally designed by Joseph Malloch
[8] which primarily uses touch, pressure, and motion sen-
sors to measure a performer’s movements and interaction
with the device. Webmapper is a graphical user interface
for libmapper [7], a ﬂexible C library for connecting multi-
media devices. Using this environment, the control signals
from the T-Stick could be easily connected to the param-
eters of the synthesizer through Webmapper’s simple drag
and drop interface. Participants also had the ﬂexibility to
edit the transfer function of each signal-parameter associ-
ation, including the possibility of creating arbitrary con-

vergent and/or divergent associations. The graphical user
interface (GUI) seen by participants is shown in ﬁg. 1. More
details on the T-Stick [8], libmapper [7], and Webmapper
[6, 16, 11] can be found in the citations and online appendix
(see section 2.4).
2.2 Setup
Nine gesture-related features from the T-Stick were exposed
as source signals to participants in the study, chosen based
on prior developments with the T-Stick [8, 13]. Based on
the accelerometer: jab, shake, eggbeater, and tilt signals
were extracted. Based on the capacitive touch sensors: av-
erage touch position, number of touch sensors activated,
brush, and rub signals were extracted. The output of the
force sensitive resistor was normalized to the range [0-1] and
exposed as a squeeze signal. Recent value of these signals
were visualized on screen using a simple Max/MSP pro-
gram, which was also used to connect the gestural signals
to libmapper. Each signal was demonstrated to the partic-
ipant and pointed out on screen before participants began
to make their mapping.
For ease of implementation, a commercial subtractive syn-
thesis plugin (Native Instruments Massive) was used as the
basis for the sound synthesizer. The plugin was conﬁgured
to follow a simple signal ﬂow as outlined in ﬁg. 2. Nine
sound parameters were exposed to the user: the fundamen-
tal frequency of the oscillators, the cross-fade between the
square and sawtooth waveforms, the spectral centroid of the
noise generator, the amplitude of the noise generator, the
overall low pass ﬁlter cutoﬀ frequency, the overall low pass
ﬁlter resonance, the amount of feedback from the output
of the ﬁlter back to its input, the amount of reverb, and
the overall amplitude at the output. As with the T-Stick,
recent values of each parameter were visualized on screen,
and each parameter was demonstrated to participants be-
fore they began to make their mapping.
2.3 Data Recording and Analysis
During the study, the libmapper network administrative bus
traﬃc [7] was recorded (referred to as the activity data be-
low). This allows participants’ actions during their mapping
design process to be reconstructed, including each signal-
parameter association made and removed and all modiﬁca-
tions to the transfer functions of these associations. After
participants completed their design, their ﬁnal mapping was
exported from Webmapper. In addition, the signals from

the study.
the T-Stick and parameter values of the synthesizer were
also recorded in real time. Only the interviews and activity
data are used here; the signal recordings and mappings are
left for future consideration.
The main analysis of the data comprised a thematic anal-
ysis of the interview transcriptions. These were read and
re-read, coded and re-coded, multiple times. Participants’
remarks were ultimately coded into two main categories
(mapping process and mapping eﬃcacy) and several themes.
Only the three themes pertaining to the mapping design
process are presented here. In addition, various ad-hoc
methods were employed to analyse the activity data: the
period of time between diﬀerent actions, the period of time
during which given mappings were active, the number of
times a mapping was tested before keeping or rejecting it,
and other metrics were considered.

3. RESUL TS
3.1 Learning
8 out of 9 participants described learning as part of the pro-
cess of designing their mapping. 5 participants speciﬁcally
mentioned having to learn how the T-Stick works as an in-
put device. 3 participants speciﬁcally mentioned having to
learn about the coupling between the gestural signals from
the T-Stick (for example, tilting the T-Stick also activates
the shake signal). 7 participants mentioned learning about
both the input device and the synthesizer. 5 participants
described learning as the ﬁrst step in the design process.
“I think I would start with what is capable from
the instrument, what is capable from the side
of synthesis, and then do some internal organi-
zation of those features and actually move [the
instrument].” (Participant C)
Considering the activity data, 7 participants can be seen
to have spent over a minute at the beginning of the activity
before making any mappings, which may be attributable

to a period of learning. If we consider the time between
mapping changes made by a participant, e.g. the time be-
tween making two connections, we can see that 8 out of 9
participants had periods of duration over two minutes at
some point during the task. If we suppose that periods of
learning correspond with these long periods of time during
which no connections or mapping modiﬁcations are made,
we may hypothesize that mapping design involves learning
throughout all stages of the design. Figure 5 charts two
typical participants’ actions over the course of the activity,
for example.
3.2 T rial and Error
8 out of 9 participants described the mapping design process
as one in which insights emerged from action: participants
especially used the terms trial and error (6/9), experimenta-
tion (4/9), discovery (3/9), and/or exploration (3/9). Par-
ticipants described their process as “messing around” , “play-
ing around,” and then “ﬁnding,”“realizing,” or “discovering”
what works and what doesn’t. The process is experimental:
the designer supposes that a certain change to the mapping
might improve it, then they test their hypothesis by making
the change and playing with the modiﬁed instrument. Par-
ticipants did not know in advance what would work well and
what wouldn’t, but rather discovered this over the course
of the activity.
“I think it just evolved from like a less useful sys-
tem to a useable one, and I think further evo-
lution would come with more experimentation
with the instrument, and the system. That sort
of thing. But yeah, it doesn’t feel like too much
of an elegant evolution as much as it is just dis-
covery, trial and error, and then sort of trial and
conﬁrmation, and satisfaction.” (Participant A)
In the activity data, we can observe that most partici-
pants roughly alternate between periods of more rapid ac-
tivity, during which many changes are made to the mapping,
and more sparse periods as described above, where the map-
ping is left unchanged or modiﬁed less frequently (ﬁg. 5).
We may hypothesize that the periods of rapid changes corre-
spond to the“trial”part of the process, while the more static
periods are related to the evaluation of the “errors” . This
cyclic view of the mapping process, alternating between two
working modes, is also supported by the 7 participants who
described the design process as requiring iteration.
3.3 First Impressions
Finally, 6 participants described a moment where their ﬁrst
impressions of a new connection immediately informed their
decision of what to do with it. 7 participants described
themselves recognizing an eﬀective change immediately. 3
participants mentioned keeping such changes through to the
end of the activity. On the other hand, 6 participants de-
scribed making a change that worked unexpectedly poorly.
“The ﬁrst thing I did was deﬁnitely the rub. The
rub for me–I guess for me reverb, sometimes you
put some sometimes you don’t, and like, I know
if I go like this (rubs the instrument)... For me
it’s only natural, and I know I was like, ’yo, this
is what I like.’ It was the ﬁrst one that I did,
and I’ve never changed it since.” (Participant A)
Most of the time, participants only had to try a map-
ping connection once to determine whether or not it was
worth keeping. Of 182 diﬀerent associations which partici-
pants tried, 133 (73%) were only tried once, and 40 (22%)
Figure 3: Comparison of the active duration of the associ-
ations participants kept compared to those they rejected.

onds that it was present during a given participant’s design
activity.
were only tried twice. The remaining 9 associations were
tried three or four times. Furthermore, considering the pe-
riod of time during which each association was active, we
can observe very diﬀerent distributions of durations between
associations which participants retained and those they re-
jected (ﬁg. 3). The active duration of retained connections
is evenly distributed from nearly the whole duration of the
task to just a few seconds. This is consistent with what
would be seen if we expected participants to ﬁnd connec-
tions worth keeping from the very beginning of the experi-
ment up to the very ﬁnal moments. On the other hand, the
duration of rejected associations is distributed exponentially
with 25% of rejected associations being active for less than
20 seconds, and a full 50% active for less than a minute.
3.4 Finishing T ouches
Participants were also asked how they would proceed if they
had more time to work on their mapping. All 9 participants
said they would continue to work on their mapping; none
felt that it was completely ﬁnished or exactly ideal. Other
than that, there was relatively little consensus among par-
ticipants about how exactly they would proceed. 5 partic-
ipants felt they would continue to reﬁne the mapping they
had already made. 3 participants said they would begin to
focus on performing with the instrument in order to learn
how best to continue to change it. 3 participants would
continue to work on a speciﬁc detail of their mapping which
they found diﬃcult to get just right during the activity. 1
participant would speciﬁcally have wanted to change the
sound synthesis output, as well as the mapping. 1 partic-
ipant thought that after a bit more reﬁnement they would
want to freeze the mapping and make no further changes,
in order to focus only on learning how to play it.
4. DISCUSSION
Although relatively little research has considered the cre-
ative process of designing a mapping in a DMI, concep-
tual frameworks have been developed in the broader ﬁeld of
creativity research which model creative processes in gen-
eral. Based on this research, R. Keith Sawyer [12] describes

eight stages of the creative process: 1) Find the problem,
2) acquire the knowledge, 3) gather related information,
4) incubation, 5) generate ideas, 6) combine ideas, 7) se-
lect the best ideas, and 8) externalize the ideas. In our
study, we observed participants working in two main modes
of activity: diﬀuse exploration and directed experimenta-
tion. These correspond roughly with stages 2-5 and 6-8 of
Sawyer’s eight stages of the creative process [12].
In the exploratory mode, designers mainly manipulate the
input device and un-connected synthesis parameters and ac-
cumulate embodied experiences about the instrument given
its current mapping. They are focused on learning the af-
fordances of the input and output systems, and the way the
two relate to each other, presently and in the imagination.
They are generally getting a feel for their mapping so far,
developing a sense for what the instrument is doing that
they like and generating ideas about how they might im-
prove their mapping moving forward. During this mode,
designers make relatively few changes to the mapping, with
periods of roughly one to two minutes between changes (de-
pending on the designer). This mode comprises a mix of
problem ﬁnding, learning, incubation, idea formation, and
idea externalization.
In the experimental mode, participants mainly make changes
to the mapping, brieﬂy moving the instrument in between
changes to compare the result of the modiﬁcation with their
expectation. In this mode, participants test the hypothe-
ses they developed while exploring the instrument. They
work in a directed manner to try to achieve any short term
goals established during their exploration and bring their
mapping closer to the ideal. During experimentation, ev-
ery change is evaluated within seconds. Whether something
works or not is recognized immediately. When it works, par-
ticipants generally keep it. When it doesn’t, they move on,
perhaps testing other hypotheses or else switching back into
the explorative mode. Designers make many more changes
while experimenting, with periods of a few seconds to half a
minute between changes (again depending on the designer).
This mode is a combination of idea combination, evaluation,
and externalization.
These two modes of activity roughly alternate and proba-
bly overlap at times. Some designers more heavily favor the
exploratory mode, others alternate between the two often,
and others spend most of their time making rapid changes
in the experimental mode.
Gradually, each designer builds up their mapping one as-
sociation at a time, until ﬁnally they reach a point where
either further changes seem unnecessary or their allotted
work time has run out. At this point the mapping is con-
sidered “ﬁnished,” but the work is likely not done. Given
more time to continue developing their mapping, most de-
signers expect that further reﬁnements could be made, the
instrument could be adapted further for a speciﬁc context
or performance, and generally there remains room for im-
provement.
5. FUTURE WORK
Based on this model of the mapping design process, tools
such as Webmapper could be modiﬁed to better support
designers’ work. For instance, the iterative connection-by-
connection approach favoured by the participants in the
study suggests a way of organizing the layout of signals.
In the current version of Webmapper’s list view, signals are
displayed in alphabetical order from the top of the screen
towards the bottom. This is advantageous insofar as the
signals have a ﬁxed order and relative location in the list,
but it often results in a jumble of arrows forming in the
(a) signals sorted by name
 (b) signals sorted by last edit

middle of the display as the mapping is built up. A typical
mapping is shown in ﬁg. 4a. An alternative would be to dis-
play signals in the order with which they are added to the
mapping, e.g. shifting signals to the top of the table when
a connection is made involving them. Using this approach,
connections are less likely to cross on screen, seen in ﬁg. 4b,
which makes it easier to read each association in the map-
ping. This also keeps the connection which the user is most
likely to want to edit (the one they just made) in a consis-
tent location on screen. Allowing the user to switch between
these two approaches may be especially useful, preserving
the beneﬁts of both.
6. LIMIT A TIONS
There are many ways in which the participants’ approach
to mapping design may have been inﬂuenced by the design
of the study, limiting the generality of these results and
suggesting avenues for future inquiry. In particular, partici-
pants had at most one hour to make their mapping, and they
were given an open-ended design goal ( “make an eﬀective
mapping for a live performance” ), and they were required
to use a T-Stick, subtractive synthesizer, and Webmapper.
The one hour time constraint, the open ended design goal,
and the unfamiliarity of the T-Stick may all have encour-
aged participants’ exploratory approach and bias towards
intuitive decision making. This suggests that the process
seen in this study may best reﬂect that adopted upon ini-
tial contact with a new instrument or set of modules, but it
may not generalize to long term design processes. A longitu-
dinal study, following designers as they develop a mapping
over a greater period of time, may provide insight into how
the design process changes as the designer becomes more
familiar and proﬁcient with their instrument.
Webmapper presents a connectionist or systems-level view
of mappings [15]. This may have encouraged participants
to adopt an iterative one-at-a-time strategy. Future studies,
using diﬀerent mapping tools (e.g. those presenting a func-
tional view of mappings, such as LOM [14] or Wekinator
[4]) may show if and how diﬀerent mapping tools encourage
diﬀerent approaches to mapping design. This may be espe-
cially interesting if diﬀerent tools favour signiﬁcantly diﬀer-
ent approaches; such results may suggest ways in which dif-
ferent tool-favoured approaches may be combined in novel
mapping tools so as to facilitate multiple ways of working.
User design studies of the kind presented here may also be
valuable sources of information about how designers evalu-
ate mappings. What makes a mapping eﬀective for a given
set of goals? What kinds of goals do music makers bring
to the activity of making mappings? The dataset produced
in this study oﬀers information regarding these questions,

and analysis has already been conducted, but it is outside
the scope of this publication. The dataset is also available
online for further analysis by the reader (see section 2.4).
7. CONCLUSION
Mappings are one of the most important aspects of a DMI
design, and the aspect that users themselves are most likely
to have to design. In order to develop mapping tools which
facilitate users design of mappings, the process of making
a mapping should be well understood. In this study, we
gain initial insights into this creative process. Designers
alternate between exploration and experimentation, learn-
ing how the instrument and the mapping works and how it
might work better, and then making small changes to try to
improve it. They rely on intuitive and immediate decision
making processes throughout, trusting their ﬁrst impres-
sions and spending little time on approaches which don’t
work well immediately. Through iterative cycles of explore
and experiment, the mapping is gradually built up a con-
nection at a time. Future research will continue to clarify
how mappings are made, leading to the design of new map-
ping tools that will better help DMI users to achieve their
creative goals.
