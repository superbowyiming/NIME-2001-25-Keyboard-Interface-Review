ABSTRACT
While most musical robots that are capable of playing the
drum kit utilise a relatively simple striking motion, the hi-
hat, with the additional degree of motion provided by its
pedal, requires more involved control strategies in order
to produce expressive performances on the instrument. A
robotic hi-hat should be able to control not only the strik-
ing, timing, and velocity to a high degree of precision, but
also dynamically control the position of the two cymbals
in a way that is consistent, reproducible and intuitive for
composers and other musicians to use.
This paper describes the creation of a new, multifaceted
hi-hat control system that utilises a closed-loop distance
sensing and calibration mechanism in conjunction with an
embedded musical information retrieval system to continu-
ously calibrate the hi-hat’s action both before and during a
musical performance. This is achieved by combining exist-
ing musical robotic devices with a newly created linear ac-
tuation mechanism, custom ampliﬁcation, acquisition and
DSP hardware, and embedded software algorithms.
This new approach allows musicians to create expressive
and reproducible musical performances with the instrument
using consistent musical parameters, and the self-calibrating
nature of the instrument lets users focus on creating music
instead of maintaining equipment.

1. INTRODUCTION
Musical robots allow composers to create new musical expe-
riences in the acoustic realm by utilizing various actuators
under computer control to manipulate an array of sonorous
objects. This allows music that is generated algorithmically
in real-time, controlled by interactive systems, or otherwise

has demanding technical requirements such as strict syn-
chronization, high performance speeds, long performance
times or extreme rhythmic complexity to be realized on
real-world acoustic instruments. While there exists a wide
variety of robotic string, wind and other instruments, per-
cussion instruments are the most numerous in the musical
robotics ﬁeld, likely due to the relative simplicity of striking
an object, in contrast with bowing a string for example.
However, when automating the instruments of a standard
drum kit, the action of the hi-hat presents a unique set of
challenges due to its pedal requiring very precise and con-
sistent control of its position while the hi-hat cymbals are
struck. The default distance between the cymbals is manu-
ally adjustable and often altered to suit the style of music
or particular piece about to be played. Expert players are
capable of quickly adapting to these adjustments and ma-
nipulating the pressure applied to the pedal while striking
the hi-hat to create expressive and dynamic rhythms that
are often central to the drum kit performance. In order to
replicate these capabilities, a robotic hi-hat should be able
to automatically sense its own position, and also listen to
its own strikes to ensure that its performance matches the
desired result that it was programmed to achieve.
This paper describes a system that was built to accom-
plish these goals. It does so ﬁrstly, by providing a back-
ground of robotic percussion and hi-hat actuation in order
to place this research in context. Following that, the me-
chanical design of the hi-hat striking, and pedal actuation
devices are illustrated. The signal conditioning, ampliﬁca-
tion and processing hardware is then described before the
workings of the embedded software algorithms that drive
the instrument are explained. Finally, conclusions about
the instrument’s eﬀectiveness are drawn and ideas for fu-
ture work are discussed.
2. BACKGROUND
From the earliest programmable ﬂute-playing automaton
built in the 9 th century, through the giant programmable
carillons of the middle ages and the sophisticated orchestri-
ons of the 19th century, automatic musical instruments have
a fascinating and varied history. Many early musical au-
tomata were created for spiritual reasons and the devices
of the mechanized music golden age of the 1800s helped to
bring music to the masses [16]. However, after the turn of
the 20th century, the reasons for their use shifted. Pioneer-
ing composers such as Casella, Malipiero and Stravinsky
wrote music speciﬁcally for the player piano, making use of
its ability to play fast, demanding and complex music [15].
These features are also exempliﬁed by Conlon Nancarrow’s
extensive work for the instrument [4].
The development of the transistor in the latter half of
the 20 th century and the work of pioneering artists such
as Trimpin [3] and Godfried Willem Raes [12] in the 1970s
330
spawned a new branch of musical automata: musical robotics.
Through the use of electronic control and digital logic, the
ﬁeld of musical robotics builds upon the ﬁeld of musical
automata, adding new capabilities to the instruments such
as real-time control, remote interactivity, precise synchro-
nization, enhanced accuracy and a higher level of musical
expression. [8] and [14] provide a more in-depth account of
the history of musical robotics.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the ﬁeld saw signiﬁcant growth
with a number of companies such as Yamaha and B¨osendor-
fer producing robotic musical instruments, and the number
of artists entering the area increasing. In the last 15 years
as building electronics has become more accessible, growth
in the ﬁeld has accelerated, culminating in several exam-
ples of musical robotics penetrating mainstream musical
outlets and being featured as centerpieces in several widely
circulated albums such as Pat Metheny’s Orchestrion [13],
Squarepusher’s Music for Robots [7], and Aphex Twin’s
Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments Pt2[6].
Most of these works prominently feature automated per-
cussion instruments, and those instruments are actuated
in a variety of diﬀerent ways from pneumatic and servo-
based devices to solenoid-driven mechanisms. [11] provides
descriptions of the most common types of robotic percus-
sion mechanisms and their control methods, along with an
analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each type.
For striking the instrument, robotic hi-hats tend to utilize
similar mechanisms to other percussion instruments. How-
ever, use of the hi-hat pedal can be described in three dis-
tinct categories. Firstly, some ensembles such as Jazari’s [2],
utilize a single position method wherein the position of the
hi-hat is ﬁxed before a performance and remains unaltered
throughout. Another common solution used in ensembles
such as Moritz Simon Geist’s MR-808 is the on-oﬀ method,
in which a large solenoid or other actuator is attached or ap-
plied to the hi-hat pedal and is capable of producing an en-
tirely open or entirely closed state, with no variable control
between the two extremes [5]. The third category is robotic
hi-hats that have continuous and variable control over the
pedal mechanism during a performance. These devices are
capable of the most expressive musical performances, but
are also the most complex to implement in practice. The
approach outlined in this paper is an attempt to improve
upon these previous robotic hi-hat systems and provide a
consistent, self-calibrating, intuitive to use and musically
expressive automatic hi-hat.
3. MECHANICAL DESIGN
The mechanical design of the Closed-Loop Robotic Hi-hat
consists of two main sections: the striking mechanism and
the pedal mechanism. Each are mechanically independent
from each other though their operations are synchronized
by electronic control circuitry. Each section is described in
turn below.
Figure 1: The mechanism used to strike the hi-hat.
3.1 Striking Mechanism
Following the analyses described in [11], a rotary solenoid
based striking mechanism was chosen for this instrument
due to their good velocity control characteristics, high speed,
adequate loudness, low levels of extraneous noise and sim-
plicity of implementation. However, since the striking mech-
anism is independent of the pedal, alternative strikers may
be used. This striker consists of a Shindengen 48 mm rotary
solenoid rated at 24 V, mechanically coupled to a standard
drum stick via its rotating plate and an aluminium bracket
as shown in Figure 1.
The opposite side of the solenoid is attached to a larger
L-shaped aluminium bracket which houses the device’s elec-
trical socket and contains a microphone stand attachment
for easy positioning of the unit. There is also a rubber stop-
per attached to the L-bracket that provides an upper limit
to the travel of the drum stick. This stopper prevents the
solenoid from reaching its own limit and creating an un-
wanted clicking sound. It also minimizes bouncing on the
return after a strike, increasing the consistency of strikes of
varying dynamics, especially during high speed sequences.
3.2 Pedal Mechanism
There are several methods of actuating the pedal mecha-
nism of a hi-hat. If anthropomorphism is desired, as is the
case with the Compressorhead [1] and Z-Machines [7] robot
bands, a mechanical foot can be used to press on the hi-hat’s
pedal. This allows the hi-hat to remain entirely unaltered
and provides the audience with a familiar paradigm. How-
ever, the force required to overcome the hi-hat’s internal
spring is high, and both bands use pneumatic systems that
have a high level of extraneous noise, and very high cost [11].
Another method described by Moritz Simon Geist for his
MR-808 ensemble utilizes a large solenoid in an on-oﬀ con-
ﬁguration to actuate the hi-hat position [5]. To minimize
the on time of the actuator and avoid overheating, Geist
reverses the polarity of the hi-hat movement from default
high, to default low. This conﬁguration assumes that the
most common position for the hi-hat during most perfor-
mances is low, and still requires up to 35 amps of current to
power the large solenoid to lift the hi-hat. It also relies on
the force of gravity to keep the hi-hat closed, limiting the
tightness the instrument can achieve in the closed state.
Other potential candidates for actuation include servo
and stepper motors, both of which would be capable of pro-
viding accurate control of the height of the pedal with an
appropriate mechanical coupling, but both of which also
generate a high level of extraneous noise which is undesir-
able for performances of very dynamic musical material and
quiet recording situations. There also exists a number of
linear actuators such as voice coil actuators which provide
built-in closed-loop positioning and quiet operation, but re-
quire an investment of thousands of dollars for the actuators
and corresponding control systems.
With all of these considerations noted, it was decided
that the most appropriate actuator for this application is
the Ledex 196658-028 5EPM soft-shift solenoid. These are
solenoid actuators that are designed to deliver a relatively
linear force response proportional to the current delivered to
them. This allows the soft-shift actuator to provide a very
quiet linear positioning capability, though without built-in
position sensing. While it does not cover every conceivable
use-case, the chosen actuator delivers a 10 mm range of
movement that is capable of positioning the hi-hat from
fully closed with pressure applied, to fully open with the
two cymbals not making contact with each other.
In this design, the hi-hat is used without the instrument’s
original pedal, but leaving the pedal’s base frame intact to

height. See section 3.2 for explanation.
mount the replacement mechanism on. A diagram which
illustrates the replacement control mechanism is presented
in Figure 2. The cymbal-pulling shaft that was connected
to the pedal is instead directly mechanically coupled to the
soft-shift solenoid by way of a tapped aluminium bracket.
The solenoid’s plunger is also tapped to accept an M3 screw,
ﬁrmly attaching it to the aluminium bracket.
The hi-hat’s internal spring requires signiﬁcant power to
overcome, even when conﬁgured for minimum tension, so in
this design it is disabled entirely. Instead, a new spring is
included between the soft-shift solenoid and the aluminium
bracket to replace the default action. The new spring is
chosen to have suﬃcient strength to allow the hi-hat to re-
tain a responsive default-open conﬁguration, while being
low enough for the actuator to overcome it and apply ade-
quate pressure to the hi-hat in the closed position.
In order to provide position feedback for this system, a
neodymium magnet is glued to the lower end of the solenoid’s
plunger. Below the magnet, an Allegro Microsystems A1301
Continuous-Time Ratiometric Linear Hall-Eﬀect Sensor1 IC
is mounted. The strong magnetic ﬁeld created by the mag-
net induces a voltage in the Hall eﬀect sensor’s output that
is directly proportional to the position of the the solenoid’s
plunger, thereby providing the electronic control systems
with information about the actuator’s height.
The entire mechanism is held in place by a 3D printed
structure. The structure attaches to the soft-shift solenoid
by its mounting screws, and provides a platform in order
to position the Hall eﬀect sensor below the unit. It also
attaches to the hi-hat’s base frame to keep the structure
ﬁrmly in place.

4. THE ELECTRONICS
The electronic systems of the Closed-Loop Robotic Hi-hat
comprises several sections. Firstly a solenoid control board
receives MIDI signals and converts them to pulses to drive
the striking mechanism. This board also communicates
with a digital signal processing board by way of a 3.3 V
UART. The DSP board utilizes a 2-channel in and out au-
dio CODEC to control the pedal mechanism by way of a
separate DC ampliﬁer, receives position information from
the Hall eﬀect sensor via a signal conditioning circuit, and
receives audio from a microphone near the hi-hat by way
of a custom preamp. A map of these connections is pre-
sented in Figure 4, and each of these elements are described
in further detail in the following subsections.
Figure 3: The custom preamp used to condition the
audio signal. Top: Behind a panel, Bottom: Bare
circuit board.
4.1 Custom Preamp
In order to experiment with a variety of diﬀerent audio input
devices, the custom preamp shown in Figure 3 was designed.
The circuit is based around the Texas Instruments INA217
Low-Noise, Low-Distortion Instrumentation Ampliﬁer IC,
and was created to provide as much ﬂexibility as possible
with regards to input devices and to deliver a high quality
audio signal with low levels of extraneous noise.
The preamp makes use of a TRS / XLR Neutrik input
and can take balanced and unbalanced audio from a wide
range of sound sources. A high impedance (Hi-Z) switch
is included to provide support for magnetic pickups, coils,
piezoelectric discs, and other high impedance sources. A
20 dB pad is also provided to aid with gain staging for
sources with higher levels. There is a single potentiometer
that dictates the level of gain applied, accompanied by a
green analogue signal LED indicator, and a red hard clip-
ping indicator that is tuned just below the clipping level
of the DSP Board’s ADC. A 3-position bias switch is also
provided, allowing the preamp to switch between conﬁgu-
rations for dynamic microphones, electret or plug-in-power
(PiP) microphones with a 5 V bias, or condenser micro-
phones with a 48 V phantom power bias.
4.2 DSP Board
In order to create an accurate, high resolution, high sample-
rate audio processing and closed-loop control system, the
custom DSP board shown in Figure 5 was built. The pri-
mary processor on the board is an Analog Devices Blackﬁn
BF592 DSP, clocked at 400 MHz. This chip was chosen
due to its high-speed audio processing capabilities coupled
with its selection of peripherals including UART, SPI, I 2C,
high-speed serial ports (SPORTs), timers and DMA.
A Wolfson WM8731 stereo audio CODEC is included on-
board, which provides up to 24 bit resolution at up to 96 kHz

sample rates, controllable by I2C, and communicating with
the Blackﬁn via I 2S digital audio streams. There is also
analogue audio conditioning circuitry on-board to feed the
audio CODEC, and the board is ﬁtted with surface mount
trimmer potentiometers, and green and red LEDs for each
input channel to aid in correctly conﬁguring the gain. MIDI
In, Out and Thru circuitry, 16 Mb of Serial Flash Em-
bedded Memory (M25P16-VMN6TP), and 4-channel SPI
(ADC124S101) and I 2C (MAX11613) ADCs are also in-
cluded on-board.
The DSP board carries out several functions. Firstly, it
provides a high speed and accurate control signal to the soft-
shift solenoid-based hi-hat positioning mechanism. This po-
sitioning signal is provided at audio rate directly from the
WM8731 CODEC and is DC biased. Secondly, the DSP
board also receives real-time position information from the
Hall-eﬀect sensor allowing it to carry out closed loop po-
sitioning as described in section 5.1. Thirdly, the board
analyses an audio feed of how the hi-hat sounds in real-time,
providing additional information to the system as described
in section 5.2.
4.3 Robotic Percussion Controller
The solenoid controller PCB shown in the lower right of Fig-
ure 4 is a generic circuit-board designed to provide highly
accurate control signals to several of the most common types
of actuators used in musical robots. It utilises a hybrid
microcontroller-FPGA system, and is capable of deliver-
ing timed pulses to solenoids with lengths accurate to the
nanosecond. This allows robotic percussion mechanisms
such as that used with this Closed-Loop Robotic Hi-hat
to strike with very consistent velocities, which signiﬁcantly
aids automatic calibration systems. This board is the re-
sult of earlier research and a publication that describes the
workings of it in greater detail can be found in [10].
4.4 Signal Conditioning Circuits
Interfacing the DSP board with the pedal mechanism re-
quires circuitry to buﬀer, scale and bias the signals. Fig-
Figure 5: The embedded DSP board which carries
out the closed loop positioning and musical infor-
mation retrieval functions.
ure 6 presents the schematics of the two conditioning cir-
cuits used in this system, one for mapping the Hall eﬀect
sensor’s output to the DSP board’s ADC (left), and one
for scaling and amplifying the DSP board’s DAC output to
control the soft-shift solenoid (right).
The ﬁrst circuit receives a voltage from the Allegro A1301
Hall eﬀect sensor proportional to the distance between the
sensor and the neodymium magnet attached to the pedal
mechanism. The sensor is powered by 5 V, has a quies-
cent voltage of 2.5 V, and the presence of a south-polarity
or north-polarity magnetic ﬁeld proportionally increases or
decreases the output voltage respectively. By utilising a
TLV274 opamp with rail-to-rail output swing in an invert-
ing ampliﬁer conﬁguration, in conjunction with trimmer po-
tentiometers controlling the gain and bias of the device, this
signal can be scaled to range from ground to 5 V. A voltage
divider on the output of the circuit scales this to the ground
to 3.3 V range expected by the DSP board’s 12 bit ADC.
The control of actuators such as soft-shift solenoids is of-

solenoid.
ten carried out by applying pulse-width modulation (PWM)
signals to the actuators via a power transistor, MOSFET
or other driver. However, while PWM was trialed in this
application, modulation rates in the audio range created
undesirable audible artifacts to emanate from the actua-
tor, and modulation rates above the audible range induced
high levels of electromagnetic interference (EMI) in nearby
circuits, most notably the Hall eﬀect sensor output. As a
result, an alternative system shown on the right of Figure 6
was created that utilises the LM3886 OvertureTM 68 Watt
High-Performance Audio Power Ampliﬁer IC to drive the
actuator with an analogue signal directly.
This right-hand circuit also utilises the TLV274 in a simi-
lar conﬁguration to the left one, in order to prepare the sig-
nal from the audio DAC for direct DC ampliﬁcation. The
LM3886, supplied with power rails of ±24 V to correspond
with the soft-shift solenoid’s 24 V rating, is utilised in a
DC-coupled conﬁguration and ampliﬁes the signal by a fac-
tor of approximately 20. The resulting higher-power signal
is then applied directly to the solenoid’s terminals.
5. THE FIRMW ARE
The goal of this work is to create a robotic hi-hat system
that can automatically self-calibrate in real-time, and can
be consistently controlled in a way intuitive to musicians.
The ﬁrmware of the DSP board is designed to achieve these
goals by carrying out 3 main functions: Implementing a
closed-loop positioning system, conducting Musical Infor-
mation Retrieval (MIR) analyses on incoming audio, and
continuously calibrating the latency, velocity and envelope
length of strikes. Each of these functions are described in
turn below.
5.1 Closed-loop Positioning
The most straightforward way to control the pedal mecha-
nism would be to set a value at the DAC and assume that
given the relatively linear nature of the soft-shift solenoid,
that value would correspond to a hi-hat height. Unfortu-
nately, though the soft-shift solenoid has a much more man-
ageable response than a standard push/pull solenoid, the
resulting response is far from being linear. In addition, the
compression of the mechanism’s spring, the default position
of the hi-hat and the physical inertia of the system all re-
sult in the system being highly inaccurate when controlled
in such a way.
In order to improve on this situation, the position in-
formation fed to the DSP board’s ADC is fed into a
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) algorithm. This al-
lows the ﬁrmware to set a target height, rather than a volt-
age level. The algorithm sees the diﬀerence between the
target and current positions, and along with information
about the previous states and the current rate of change,
outputs a voltage that will bring the actuator as close as
possible to the target height.
Since a hi-hat’s default height is manually adjustable, the
absolute position each time the unit is set up is likely to
vary signiﬁcantly. To account for this, the ﬁrmware per-
forms a short initialization routine on start-up (and at any
time when commanded to) that sends the soft-shift solenoid
minimum and then maximum power, logs the minimum and
maximum height values, and uses them to scale subsequent
positioning.
5.2 Musical Information Retrieval System
Though the positioning system can place the hi-hat between
the initialized extremes, this still does not provide musi-
cians controlling the unit with information about what the
musical result will be at a given height. This is why an
embedded MIR system was implemented in the ﬁrmware.
As the primary musical result of a hi-hat being opened and
closed is changes in the length of the sound’s envelope, the
goal of the system is to allow the user to specify the desired
length of envelope, and for the robotic hi-hat to strike the
instrument with the cymbal at a height that produces that
envelope length. In practice, the system is receiving MIDI
Control Change (CC) messages, mapped linearly from the
shortest to longest desired envelope lengths. These values
may be presented to the user in an interface that displays
these envelope length values in seconds explicitly.
To extract the envelope length information from the in-
coming audio, the algorithm undertakes several processes.
1. Since the audible activity of a hi-hat is predominantly
present in the higher end of the audible spectrum, a
simple hi-pass ﬁlter is applied to remove any unre-
lated low frequency activity that may be present in
the audio.
2. An envelope signal is then created by averaging the
last 1024 values of the audio stream.
3. After a MIDI Note On message which corresponds to
the striker of the robotic hi-hat is received, the algo-
rithm expects a strike to follow soon after. When a
sudden onset is observed on the averaged envelope sig-
nal, the algorithm starts a timer which measures the
length of the envelope.
4. When the envelope drops below a certain threshold
value, the timer is stopped, and the length of the en-
velope is recorded.
334
The system populates a table of height values that cor-
respond with the desired envelope lengths (user’s sent CC
values) and interpolates between the measured values to
generate a curve that creates a linear relationship between
the two. The algorithm automatically and continuously up-
dates the calibration table when new, eligible envelope val-
ues are received, but because of the 2-dimensional nature
of the velocity of strikes and the position of the hi-hat, un-
interrupted strikes of the same velocity may be few and far
between. Because of this, it is best to carry out a short ini-
tialization of the unit on start-up, sending spaced out strikes
to the hi-hat at full velocity, at several diﬀerent heights.
5.3 Continuous Calibration
In addition to the initialization of the hi-hat pedal mecha-
nism height and envelope lengths, the DSP board can also
record the latency of each strike by measuring the length of
time between MIDI Note On messages and note onsets, and
record the loudness of each strike by noting the amplitude
of the transient following an onset. The implementation
of these techniques is based on previous work done for the
Closed-Loop Robotic Glockenspiel instrument, described in
detail in [9].
When latency compensation is enabled, the instrument
is also able to keep a table of the latencies of strikes at
every velocity value and compensate for them, creating a
ﬁxed latency for the instrument. This can then be compen-
sated for using the latency compensation function featured
in most digital sequencers. The recorded amplitude values
can also be used to compare the observed values with an
ideal velocity curve in order to create a more consistent and
musical response for the system. Both of these capabilities
are also based on work done for the Closed-Loop Robotic
Glockenspiel.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This paper has presented a robotic hi-hat system that uti-
lizes a new closed-loop control system coupled with an em-
bedded MIR algorithm to provide musicians and composers
with a consistent, accurate instrument with which to create
dynamic and expressive musical performances. The While
the instrument does achieve the stated goals, there are many
areas for future work to be undertaken. To aid in prototyp-
ing and experimentation, the system currently consists of
several separate pieces of electronic hardware, and setup
time is not optimal. Further development will see the sys-
tem integrated within a single portable enclosure, with all of
the necessary circuitry consolidated. In addition, while the
continuous calibration and PID algorithms do fulﬁll their
intended purposes, there is also scope for optimization and
reﬁnement of the software in order to deliver a more high
performance and user friendly system. Lastly, a full char-
acterization of the system’s characteristics complete with
comparisons of the accuracy with and without the use of
closed-loop positioning and MIR algorithms is underway
and will aid in understanding and revealing additional av-
enues for reﬁnement.
It is hoped that outlining these closed-loop and MIR con-
trol systems for robotic hi-hats will inspire other musical
roboticists to develop their robotic hi-hat systems beyond
ﬁxed-position and 2-state on/oﬀ conﬁgurations. Doing so
opens up a new world of expression to the instrument, and
these developments bring us ever closer to a goal of human-
level robotic musicianship on the hi-hat and in robotic per-
cussion in general.
