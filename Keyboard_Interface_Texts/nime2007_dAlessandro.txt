"6 INTRODUCTION
ts explained in [nn]i the development of gestural controlj
lers for sound synthesis is today a bit less a pioneer’s buj
sinessk zndeedi plenty of sound synthesis modules are now
available in usual and inexpensive computersk zntegrated
toolkitsi with various sensorsi user friendly analogjtojdigital
converters and conﬁguration softwaresi can be purchased at
aﬀordable pricesk Moreoveri several environments for mapj
pings and synthesis implementationi such as MaxlMSPi and
powerful transmission protocols 4ekgk OS2g are well supporj
ted and integrated on usual plateformsk
Thusi in several contextsi the matter is less having techj
nical answersi than formulating good questionsk We can obj
serve that concretization of an original musical controller is
often part of the compositionnal processk This vision can eaj
sily be extended to scientiﬁc researchk Particullaryi in signal
processingi improvements can be realized thanks to realjtime
manipulations and observations of resultsk
zn this projecti we aim at developing a gestural controller
dedicated to realjtime voice processing in some stationnary
and articulative aspectsk Section 9 explains technical choices
related to penjbased continuous pitch and intensity controlk
Section o proposes an embedded controller for articulated

+6 PEN5BASED MUSICAL CONTROL
xraphic tabletsi which are initially developed and sold to
meet image professionals needs 4designersi architectsi edij
torsi etckgi can today be considered as a common device
in the computer music contextk Moreoveri in this ﬁeldi we
can observe unanimous use of Wacom™ productsk ts an
examplei in all existing NzMv proceedingsi more than 9p puj
blications mentioned the use of a graphic tableti and about
.m percents of them where Wacom™ devicesk
zndeedi most of the models provide a large number of
parametersi with high precision and low latencyi structured
around our intuitive writing abilitiesk These properties make
Wacom™ controllers really good candidates to ﬁt the yunt
and Kirk’s real0time multi0parametric control system criteria
[p][nn]k tvailability of MaxlMSP and Pure uata externalsi
interfacing most of existing modelsi also contributes to this
wide disseminationk

+6" RealtimeCALM Control Model
Figure 2: RealtimeCALM gestural controller in use6
Last yeari we presented new generators and mappings for
expressive singing voice synthesis 4Realtime2tLMg [o]k zn
that worki we proposed and demonstrated an example of
gestural controller 4Instrument 2 gi based on an t( Wacom
xraphire™ i in which pitchi intensity and timbre features 4rej
lated to glottal ﬂo w parametersg were mapped to xi y and
pressure stylus movements 4cfk wigure 9gk zn spite of the simj
plicity of our mapping strategy 4about nm –onejtojone– or
–onejtojmany– connectionsgi it appeared that realistic muj
sical gestures could be reached 4legatoi vibratoi staccatoi
etckg and that learning process 4presently n yearg evolved
quite continuously until reaching an interesting leveli alloj
wing interpretation and improvisation [n]k Then tests have
also been done with other kind of synthesis 4especially acousj
tical instruments modelsg and our approach remained relej
vantk These –latent– skills are explained by the long backj
ground that we usually have in manipulation of peni through
writing techniquesk
+6+ Pen5Based Pitched Sounds Control
ts a matter of facti we are focusing on the accurate control
of pitched sounds1 4singing voice in preceding studies [o][1]gk
zn this ﬁeldi litterature doesn’t mention a lot of formalisms
for penjbased continuous 4pitchi intensityg gesturesi as it
exists of course for continuous pitch acoustical instrumentsi
like violin [n9]i but also for some electrical devicesi like thej
remin [.]k One of the most advanced formalization concerns
the helicoid representation of notes in the Voicer [(]i involj
ving well know circularity in perception of frequency [q]k We
also notice the Kyma [9] initiativei which developed a great
framework for Wacom™ control of sound synthesisi but wij
thout formally considering 4pitchi intensityg issuesk
+63 Solving Ergonomic Issues
yere we introduce a particular framework for expressive
penjbased 4pitchi intensityg musical gesturesk This strucj
ture is much more based on ergonomic issues of playing and
impact on sound synthesisi than on psychoacoustic represenj
tationsk Our approach considers that natural pen movements
are mainly forearmj and wristjcentered soft curves 4cfk wij
gure ogi easier to perform than lines [o] or complete circles
[(]k Then come ﬁngers movements achieving detailsk
1This point of view doesn’texclude the use of our instrument
for unpitched synthesisk We just mention thati in this worki
devicesi mappings and practices have been optimized for
pitched sounds controlk
Figure u: Pen drawing soft natural curve +Cqs as a
combination of forearm7 +Aq and wrist7centered +Bq
movements6
Thusi we deﬁne a strategy where pitch information rej
sults from a transformation of 4xi yg cartesian coordinates
into polar coordinatesi but where center of the circle posij
tion 4xCi yCg is tweakable in order to ﬁt forearm and wrist
circular movementsk Typicallyi this center will clearly be out
of the drawing surfacei close to tablet borderi where the foj
rearm is supportedk This concept is part of the playing diaj
gram illustrated in wigure 1k vquations are presented below "
R =
p
(x − xC)2 + (y − yC)2
θ = arctan( y − yC
x − xC
)
with R and θ respectively the radius and the angle of the
4xi yg pointi measured in polar coordinatesi with the center
localized in 4xCi yCgi instead of 40i 0gk

+64 Angle Mapping
ts pitch control is now related to θi angular information
will be normalized and modiﬁed in order to lay out a range of
notes 4between 9 and p octavesg in which every semitone 4in
tempered scaleg corresponds to the same anglek This reprej
sentation is part of the typical playing diagram illustrated
in wigure 1k This kind of conversion is obtained by following
equations "

i = N × 12 × θ − θB
θE − θB
where N is the number of octaves we want on the playing
surfacei θB is the leftmost angle visible on the playing surj
facei θE is the rightmost angle visible on the playing surface
and f0R is the reference frequency corresponding to the θB
positionk t typical pitch modiﬁcation on this diagram is
illustrated in wigure pk

ments +Bq realizing a pitch modiﬁcatio n +Aq6
+65 Pressure Mapping
2oncerning intensity mappingi we decided to keep the
same approach as in Realtime2tLM control model [o]k Thusi
sound intensity and stylus pressure are linkedk zt appears to
be relevanti because based on the drawing metaphori –maj
king sounds– is related to –using pen–i and pen is indeed
used when pressed on the playing surfacek
+66 Radius Mapping and
Interest in Finger5Based Gestures
t ﬁrst way of highlighting radius 4Rg interest in this mapj
pingi is to consider that some timbre features have to be
controlled coherently with 4pitchi intensityg gesturesk t tyj
pical situation is singing synthesis controlk zndeedi voice quaj
lity inﬂections often appear synchronously with pitch and
intensity modiﬁcationsi and combined control of these paj
rameters eﬀectively contribute to expressivity [1]k Thusi linj
king R with these spectral attributes justiﬁes other kind of
curves where radius is no more constantk Neverthelessi unj
derlying forearm and wrist movements remain the samei and
training just consists in integration of ﬁnger ﬂexionsk t typij
cal mixed modiﬁcation on the playing diagram is illustrated
in wigure (k
Figure x: Demonstration of mixed θ and R modi7
ﬁcatio n +Aq involving both forearm/wrist +Bq and
ﬁng er7based +Cq movements6
tnother interesting aspect of our layout concerns vibrato
synthesisk zndeedi we know that oscillations do not concern
only pitchi but also energy and several spectrum paramej
ters [nm]k zn additioni it appeared that penjbased vibrato
could easily be achieved by little circular movements around
a ﬁxed pointk zn this situationi both R and pressure are also
involved in vibrato gesture descriptionk Thusi this feature ofj
fers good opportunities to develop ﬂexible multijdimensional
mappings around vibrato eﬀectsk
36 NON5PREFERED HAND ISSUE
Mapping strategies developed in section 9 proposed some
ergonomic improvementsi mainly in pitch and intensity maj
nipulationk Performing on the diagram illustrated in wigure
1 makes it possible to learn and train to simple techniques
4ekgk legato or vibratogi in order to reach an interesting level
for interpretation and improvisationk tnywayi more advanj
ced 4pitchi intensityg structuresi like arpeggiosi trillsi apj
poggiaturasi etck are not possiblek Moreoveri even with the
large number of parameters transmitted by the stylus2i only
slow timbre variations can be achievedk zn summaryi we obj
serve that penjbased gestures have a inherent lack in controlj
ling articultions of all kinds 4pitchi intensity and timbregk
zn this contexti development of a controller for the nonj
prefered hand has to be donek yere we describe three main
challenges that we propose to focus onk wirsti we need to be
able to achieve quick and localized multijﬁnger sequences
for 4pitchi intensityg controli as used in many typical insj
trumental ﬁngering techniques [n9] 4direct controlgk Then
we consider the opportunity to use a priori music knowledge
4ekgk tonesi scalesg in order to transform continuous 4pitchi
intensityg gestures into typical articulated sequences " arj
peggiosi long ascending and descending scalesi etc 4cfk –ﬁnej

perform some timbre articulationsi ekgk consonants 4spectral

36" r533r Strategy
2onsidering preceding constraintsi use of multiple pressurej
sensing surfaces appears to be powerfulk zn this categoryi we
can ﬁnd several alljinjone controllersi such as Tactex MT2
vxpress Pad™i Lemur™i or Zjtiles™k tnywayi we decided to
develop an original –onjtablet– shape based on . indepenj
dant wSRs from znfusion Systems™i for technical reasons "
portabilityi unicityi pricei latencyi ﬂexibilit yk
zn this conﬁgurationi wSRs are separated into 9 groupsk
On the one handi o sensors are aligned in order to deﬁne o
thumb positionsk These positions refer to our o main chalj
lenges 4directi modal and spectral controlsgk On the other
handi p sensors are aligned in order to achieve four ﬁngers
playing techniquesk t major ergonomic issue of this conﬁj
guration was to ﬁn d a comfortable layoutk ts this problem
could not be solved eﬀectively with an horizontal tableti it
has been decided to ﬂip the device verticallyi in a position
close to accordion playing 4cfk wigure ngk Thusi group of p
wSRs are placed on the fronti and group of o wSRs on the
rear part of the devicek We observed that such a movement
didn’t aﬀect writing abilities needed by the prefered handk
uetails about positions are illustrated in wigure )k

36+ Direct Control
This technique has been developed to allow user to perj
form direct 4pitchi intensityg modiﬁcations based on multij
ﬁnger playing techniquesk zt means that current pitch is
build from the penjbased reference 4related to θgi plus a
deviation depending on adopted four ﬁngers positionk zt can
be used to implement ekgk –stringjlike– ﬁngering sequencesk
t note pointed on the tablet corresponds to a –reference
fret– on the virtual fretboardk Then pitch can be increased
4o semitonesg or lowered 4n semitoneg 4cfk wigure .gk

tablet6
363 Modal Control
This technique has been implemented to be able to perj
form large pen movementsi with a structural control on harj
monic contentsk Thusi various ﬁnger conﬁgurations corresj
pond to pitch and intensity nonjlinear mappings in a way
arpeggiosi deﬁned scales or other note articulations can be
achievedk Practicallyi pitch contour is ﬂattened and intenj
sity is modulated to sound louder around chosen notesk The
amount of this eﬀect is linked to wSRs pressure valuesk
364 Spectal Control
2oncrete spectral techniques have not been implemented
yetk tnywayi as movements on wSRs can reach a really inj
teresting speed 4presently a few events by secondgi this asj
pect has to be maintained as a major issuek Related ekgk
to xRtSSP project [)]i the use of these kinds of ﬁngering
techniques could provide a powerful way to trigger phonetic
contents in the context of realjtime voice synthesisk
46 CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
zn this paperi we have developed mapping strategies for
both prefered and nonjprefered handsk These investigations
have been done considering some ergonomic aspectsi in orj
der to build a compacti intuitivei comfortable and expressive
controllerk uecisions were also made considering longjterm
underlying purposesi related to highjquality realjtime artij

this new controller clearly ﬁt our expectationsk Moreoveri
