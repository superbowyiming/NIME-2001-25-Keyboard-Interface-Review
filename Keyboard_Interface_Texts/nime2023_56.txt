ABSTRACT
This paper examines the use of the no-input mixing desk—
or feedback mixer—across a range of musical practices. The
research draws on twenty two artist interviews conducted by
the authors, and on magazine and forum archives. We fo-
cus particularly on how the properties of the no-input mixer
connect with the musical, aesthetic and practical concerns
of these practices. The affordability, accessibility, and non-
hierarchical nature of the instrument are examined as fac-
tors that help the idea spread, and that can be important
political dimensions for artists.
The material, social and cultural aspects are brought to-
gether to provide a detailed picture of the instrument that
goes beyond technical description. This provides a useful
case study for NIME in thinking through these intercon-
nections, particularly in looking outwards to how musical
instruments and associated musical ideas travel, and how
they can effect change and be changed themselves in their
encounters with real-world musical contexts.

1. INTRODUCTION
The no-input mixing desk, as a specific manifestation of
feedback music, has been explored in one form or another
since at least the 1960s. While it might not be considered
a “new” instrument in the context of the New Interfaces for
Musical Expression conference, it has taken on a new life in
the 21st century, and provides a valuable site for exploring
how a musical technology has spread, been discovered by
individuals, and gained traction in different musical com-
munities.
No-input mixing can take many forms, but typically in-
volves plugging an output from an analogue mixing desk
back into an input so that the circuit forms a loop: an os-
cillator. Feedback transforms the controls on the mixer.
For example, the EQ dials that would normally boost or
attenuate different frequency bands can cause smooth or
abrupt changes to pitch, timbre, rhythm, or more holistic

behavioural changes. The no-input mixer has been high-
lighted as a point of inspiration for thinking about the de-
sign of digital instruments [4, 40, 32, 44] in a NIME context,
and a range of digital augmentations [8, 29] and completely
digital systems [50, 41] have been developed.
The paper follows on from calls [27, 23] to bring musi-
cological and ethnomusicological methods to bear on ex-
panding our understanding of new electronic and digital
instruments, exploring the relationships between technolo-
gies, musicians, musical practices, and musical communi-
ties: “the field needs a stronger analytical approach into
how music-technical elements travel across cultures, how the
technology carries the music into new contexts, and what
kind of musical dialogue ensues when a new technology is
introduced” [23]. This research also examines the political
dimension to artists’ engagements with music technologies
as highlighted by [30], along with questions of access and
instrumental longevity.
This builds on existing work on feedback and music [46,
51, 24], particularly the recent Feedback Musicianship Net-
work [18], and on work by Magnusson that considers the mi-
gration [23] and ergodynamics of musical instruments [22].
Magnusson proposes the term ergodynamics to bring to-
gether the material properties of an instrument with the
wider cultural context and subjective personal experience
to articulate experiences of engaging with that instrument.
We therefore examine different musical contexts in which
the no-input mixer has been used, how artists have arrived
at using the no-input mixer, and different ways of engaging
with the mixer. We seek to highlight some of the variety in
usage, beyond the work of some of the more visible propo-
nents of the instrument. This provides a case study in the
flow between the musical ideas presented by an instrument,
and the musical cultures it encounters. This can serve as
a useful template for thinking about similar relationships
with new digital musical technologies.
The research draws on 22 interviews with artists who use
or have used no-input mixing in their practices. Maga-
zine and forum archives are also used to provide broader
insights into no-input mixer use. This paper is part of a
wider research project on the no-input mixer. Many is-
sues are beyond the scope of what is presented here, such
as a deeper engagement on discussions of control, interac-
tion and agency (see [33]), a closer look at the actual music
made with the mixer, or a more in-depth presentation of
the interview data.
A zoomed out perspective on no-input use over time is
given in Section 2, followed by a look at the importance of
the low cost and availability of mixers in Section 3. Specific
musical contexts that the mixer has encountered are exam-
ined in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 brings these elements
together in a discussion of ergodynamics.
2. NO-INPUT MIXING OVER TIME
No-input mixing as a practice can be found in the feedback
experiments of artists such as David Tudor [21, 34], Com-
posers Inside Electronics [9, p 183], the Sonic Arts Union,
´Eliane Radigue [43], Pauline Oliveros [12], Jaap Vink [48]
and Roland Kayn [42], amongst others. The artists inter-
viewed for this study cited a range of other relevant origin
points. Hendrix-style guitar feedback has been an influen-
tial model, with many no-input artists starting from feed-
back with guitars and pedals, and subsequently removing
the guitar from the equation. Pedal-based feedback pro-
cesses have been common in noise music [39, p 141], and
a mixing desk provides a practical way to manage these
loops. David Lee Myers—as Arcane Device—worked exten-
sively with no-input matrix mixer feedback processes from
the 1980s onwards, and describes this work as having come
out of experimenting with delay networks, following Robert
Fripp’s Frippertronics. Simon Grab placed his use of the
mixer as a continuity of dub mixer practices, e.g. King
Tubby’s use of delayed and filtered feedback loops [53].
The name “no-input mixing board” was coined by Toshi-
maru Nakamura in the late 1990s, particularly in relation
to his series of releases No Input Mixing Board [35], No In-
put Mixing Board 2 [36], etc. The explicit, exclusive focus
on the mixer in the work, and perhaps more importantly,
the naming of this technical setup appear to be crucial for
the identity of the technical configuration as something that
might be considered an instrument. An instrument is not
merely a collection of physical properties, but is also the“lo-
cus of a rich and complex interplay of cultural associations
and embodied practices” [26]. Naming it allows a process of
culturalisation [15] to attach itself to a particular moniker.
Nakamura is credited by Will Montgomery—perhaps in
a slightly tongue-in-cheek manner—as having started “the
one man genre of no-input mixing board music” [28]. From
coverage in The Wire magazine, this feels like an accurate
summary: since 2000 they have mentioned either “no in-
put mixing”, “no input mixer”, “feedback mixer”, or “mixing
desk feedback” on 112 occasions, with 83 of those occasions
referring to Nakamura (74.1%). 25 other artists are men-
tioned explicitly as having used the instrument. This fo-
cus partly reflects Nakamura’s prolific concert schedule and
quantity of published releases (43 instances are album re-
views for releases featuring Nakamura), but also misses a
much larger range of underground practitioners. Jez Riley
French links this to the naming of the instrument: “I think
when Toshi coined the phrase “no input” [...] a lot of other
work that was happening but wasn’t in the high art, aca-
demic art, sound art cliques that latched onto the term, was
pretty much wiped away, through no fault of Toshi” (partic-
ipant interview). We can gain a window into this by looking
at Vital Weekly1, a smaller publication with more of a focus
on underground music (artists can send new releases to be
reviewed directly). This gives a broader picture of no-input
mixer usage over the same time period. The search terms
occur on 161 occasions, with only 41 of those (25.5%) relat-
ing to Nakamura, and covering a total of 87 distinct artists
using a no-input mixer.
The no-input mixer has also been encountered in syn-
thesis and particularly modular synthesiser communities.
While “modular synthesis” doesn’t delimit any particular
musical style, the increasingly broad appeal of the practice
provides a conduit for no-input mixing to reach a slightly
wider audience, as an affordable way to explore related con-
cepts. The popular Modwiggler forum has 133 threads that
mention the search terms, 11 of which are dedicated specif-
1http://vitalweekly.net/
ically to the subject of no-input mixing. A range of primer
articles have been written for publications like Synthtopia,
Play Music Today and Create Digital Music, and intro-
ductory videos accrue tens of thousands of views such as
Telekom Electronic Beats (39,507 views as of 19 Jan 2022)
[49], Sarah Belle Reid’s introductory tutorials (43,475) [45],
and Richard Knight’s videos on beat making (24,158) [19]
and minimal techno (11,844) [20] 2.
3. COST AND A V AILABILITY
A key factor, cited by several participants, in the uptake
of no-input mixing is the relatively low cost compared to
many other music technologies, and the wide availability of
mixers (see Table 1). This was contrasted with the expense
of instruments like the guitar or, more frequently, modular
synthesis equipment.
Modular synthesis—particularly in its Eurorack incarnation—
is renowned for being an expensive way to make music. Con-
trasting this with no-input mixing, Mira Martin-Gray notes
the risk of modular synthesis “becoming more of an aspira-
tional consumerist lifestyle than an art-form” [14].
Unlike modular synthesis—and even circuit bending in
this respect—there is no obvious way to commercialise the
practice3. The absence of a straightforward retail object
may also be one factor in the no-input mixer resisting being
seen an instrument in the usual sense.
Unlike many other music technologies, there is no sense
of a price hierarchy. While different mixing desks were de-
scribed by participants as having very different sounds and
possibilities, a more expensive mixing desk does not nec-
essarily lead to a richer or more flexible instrument (other
than perhaps the number of channels or routing options
provided). Often the converse was reported, with artists
becoming attached to particularly cheap models or mixers
with significant defects that manifest in musically useful
ways.
A further advantage of repurposing a pre-existing mass-
produced device is that there is less dependence on the man-
ufacturer. A no-input mixer cannot be discontinued in the
sense that other music technologies might be. Manufactured
products such as Shakti’s No Input Feedback Mixer, Land-
scape’s Stereo Field and Herbs and Stones’Pathways, which
employ feedback networks similar to those used in no-input
mixing at the core of their designs, are limited due to the
small scale boutique approach to manufacturing, and are
unlikely to persist as long-term instruments by comparison.
For a number of participants, these aspects make using
the mixer a political statement rather than just a pragmatic
choice. For example, the ecological and political statement
of reusing old equipment, of finding new ways of working
with what is to hand rather than buying new products. The
mixer was also seen as a way out of the commodity fetishism
bound up with modular synthesis, switching the focus in
post-concert discussions for example to being about sound
and music rather than “gear”, or with these discussions at
least being reframed from the “what” of the product to the
“how” of the process.
Finally, an important feature that no-input mixing shares
with both modular synthesis and circuit bending is the po-
tential for customisation: the same building blocks can be
reconfigured in endless ways. The routing can be highly

personal: using auxiliary outputs, inserts, master output,
headphone outputs, group channels, splitting channels with
Y (or even W) cables to send one output to multiple places,
incorporating the panning in different ways in the routing,
experimenting with pre- and post-EQ settings, and so on.
“It’s that open-ended mode of self-discovery that necessi-
tates a very personal relationship to the instrument” [14];
the mixer can be seen as a musical opportunity rather than
a musical solution in the sense explored by [30].
For the NIME community, there are three considerations
here that contribute to existing discussions around longevity
and the wider take-up and of new musical instruments [31,
25, 13, 11]. Firstly, that accessibility in terms of both cost
and availability allows the instrument to spread easily: in
the case of the no-input mixer, only the idea needs to be
transmitted. Artists who have read about the instrument
or encountered it in a performance or recording can source
hardware locally, and experiment for themselves. Secondly,
it rehabilitates existing skills with mixing desks: a profi-
ciency with routing, inserts, sends and returns, group chan-
nels, and so on can be brought to bear in working with the
instrument. Finally, there is a richness to the instrument
itself which seems to support long-term engagement: new
sounds and behaviours can be discovered even after long
periods of using the instrument. The potential for endless
customisation, and the complexity of the feedback processes
at play appear to be key factors in this respect.
4. MUSICAL CONTEXTS
This section traces no-input mixer use across a range of
musical contexts: through reductionist music, free improvi-
sation, noise, notated composition, rhythmic music, sound
design, and finally pop music.
Nakamura’s involvement in reductionist musical scenes
in the late 1990s and early 2000s ( Onkyo in Tokyo, Berlin
Reductionism, or the New London Silence for example) is
well documented [3, 38, 37]. Some of the ideas from these
movements can be traced through into wider no-input mixer
usage, particularly an anti-virtuosity stance, a push back
against the need for improvising players to immediately re-
act to each other, and to be able to slow down and stick with
particular sounds or behaviours for longer durations. These
ideas map to some other areas of practice where no-input
mixers might be used, even where there is quite a different
underlying aesthetic, such as drone, noise and power elec-
tronics. A common theme across the participant interviews
was a view of the mixer as being well suited to what might
be called a “let it be” approach to playing: the performer is
a listener as much as a player, in part due to the difficulty
in predicting the outcome of any of their own actions.
Improvisation therefore usually plays a key part in work-
ing with the mixer. The generally unruly and unpredictable
nature of the instrument seems well suited to situations
where the performer is able to embrace unexpected sonic
changes. For several participants the mixer was a route
into playing with others that wasn’t so straightforward with
their other musical tools, and therefore for being a closer
part of improvised musical communities. The mixer was
discussed as supporting an immediate, instrument-like re-
lationship, analogous to acoustic instruments (“[no-input
mixer] felt as close to an acoustic instrument as electronic
instruments could get”, Adam Saikelay).
Solo performances were often framed as being slightly
less freely improvised: participants might arrive with a par-
ticular starting point (usually a particular mixer patching
setup) and perhaps a few ideas for how to proceed initially.
Within this however, most participants were open to sub-
stantial diversions as the mixer responded in different ways
and took the performance in unexpected directions.
Despite the pull of improvisation with the mixer, it has
found a place in composition, perhaps most notably in Marko
Ciciliani’s Mask [7], a piece well known to many of the other
participants. Ciciliani used “sounds I can more or less re-
produce identically” for the piece. Reflecting on the piece,
Cicliani suggests the“sonic result was relatively poor, as the
recreatable sounds were the least interesting”.
Christian Carri` ere and Adam Saikaley have often taken
a tuned, polyphonic approach to no input mixing that pro-
vides a notable contrast with most of the other artists inter-
viewed for this study 4. Carri` ere’s practice has emerged in
part from his background as a sound engineer, particularly
for live television where there was already a focus on having
to perform with the mixing desk. He tends to work with
larger desks with high channel counts, where each channel is
a distinct, pre-tuned note, and the desk functions more like
an organ. The feedback loops are pre-fader, so that turn-
ing up and down the volume of each tone with the faders
does not interfere with the carefully tuned pitches. The per-
formable aspects are therefore almost entirely predictable.
Many of the artists interviewed have engaged with rhyth-
mic music in various ways. This can bring the no-input
mixer into connection with quite different areas of musical
practice, such as minimal techno (latent in many of Naka-
mura’s early recordings), dub, hip-hop and electronic pop.
Knight’s work has leant into the minimal techno aesthetic
explicitly, taking advantage of the metronomic pulses that
emerge from feedback paths that have the low frequencies
significantly boosted. Grab’s work with Yao Bobby explores
aspects of dub and hip-hop. The duo have specific pieces
that they recreate live and Grab has to be able to transition
from track to track quickly and easily. One useful tool for
this is having a control voltage sequencer that can be passed
into the mixer, and that permits storing and recalling preset
patterns. This allows Grab to instantly recall a particular
pattern to be sent to the mixer, even if the way the pattern
manifests is still reliant on him having to set aspects of the
mixer manually.
Philip White’s conceptual covers album with Ted Hearne,
R WE WHO R WE , engages explicitly with popular mu-
sic. Here, the mixer is used to present strange, decimated
versions of popular songs, with the slick pop production re-
placed with the raw sound of the mixer. Two other direct
engagements with pop music can be found firstly in Mike
Dubue’s work, using mixer feedback in live performances
and studio recordings for his band Hilotrons, and secondly
Trever Hagen’s use of no-input mixer on Taylor Swift’sClo-
sure5 [47]. In these examples, the mixer tends to play one
small part amongst a richer arrangement.
Hagen’s work for Swift in particular is perhaps more use-
fully thought of as a sound design approach to using the
mixer, where the performable and behavioural aspects of
the mixer are subordinate to the specific signification of the
sound world. A range of no-input mixing sample packs—
collections of pre-recorded audio files—have been released
commercially6. The Glitchedtones pack suggests that the
sounds could be useful for “situations where a character’s

5although it is very difficult to hear the specific role played
by the mixer in this recording

hearing is impaired, for constructing glitching communica-
tions and old school computers loading or to heighten the
tension in horror and science fiction scenes”. This is an
interesting context for no-input mixing as it removes the
interactive dimension which was a big part of the appeal
for most participants, retaining only the sounding output.
5. ERGODYNAMICS
Given the breadth of usage articulated above, we can begin
to explore what Magnusson refers to as the ergodynamics
of the instrument [23]. This term is used to connect to-
gether the material qualities of an instrument alongside an
awareness for how the instrument integrates into musical
contexts. It therefore blends objective analyses with sub-
jective cultural perspectives, and so is always an analysis
from one point of view, and is something that inevitably
shifts over time.
While there are important continuities between all of the
musical contexts described above, considering them one-by-
one below provides a helpful way to connect together the
music, the mixer and that specific musical context, even if
this risks reductive chariacatures of the contexts.
5.1 Listening
The “let it be” attitude articulated above in Section 4 pro-
vides a starting point for this form of analysis. We can
trace a clear connection between the properties of the ma-
terial object—unpredictability, complex control, emergent
behaviours—and particular artistic philosophies such as the
tendency to remove or undermine composer agency, Lucier
and others’ approach to using scientific and acoustic test
procedures as compositional material, anti-viruosity, letting
processes unfold over time, or ideas from free improvisation
about exploring an instrument as a performative event [1,
17]. Barrett suggests the no-input mixer can be conceived
as “a physical embodiment of this kind of attitude” [2]. The
mixer can transport this idea to some extent: artists who
happen upon mixer feedback in their own experiments may
find themselves encouraged to stand back and focus on lis-
tening and to take a more collaborative stance with their
instrument, or to explore a freer approach to improvisation
than they might have otherwise considered.
For Yan Jun, no input mixing is a way out from having
to worry about being responsible musically for the result of
his actions:
The first thing is [...] it’s not my responsibility.
[...] if you play the guitar, you play it good or not
good, it’s your playing, it’s your ability and it’s
your decisions. But if I play some feedback noise,
it could be bad or terrible, but I just show this:
how this sound, this terrible sound, is. I don’t
have any responsibility, it’s not my creation. I
think that’s very important for me: to avoid this
part. Because I was always very nervous on the
stage. I was always trying to avoid this part of
musicianship.
This presents a more extreme end of the spectrum where
the feedback processes and their sounds are seen to pre-
exist the performance, and the artist’s responsibility is to
show these processes, rather than necessarily perform them
musically. Dino [16] and Nakamura [10]. have expressed
similar sentiments.
5.2 Expression and the body
It’s important to note that this relationship to the instru-
ment is not a deterministic or inevitable consequence of
the material specifics, but a particular confluence of ma-
terial and cultural factors. Several participants explicitly
contrasted their approach to Nakamura’s. Andrew Leslie
Hooker places a greater emphasis on a more traditional idea
of instrumental control, and a more dynamic, bodily kind
of interaction with the mixer.
[Nakamura’s] approach is completely different from
mine: whereas I like to actually play the instru-
ment, he will say that he likes the instrument to
play him. [...]
[Nakamura] hardly moves, just his fingers. I’m
all over the place, moving my hands, my arms,
my head’s moving, it’s like I move with the sound
of the mixer.
While a reductionist approach to improvisation might es-
chew any necessity for fast, reactive playing, this is a point
of pride for Hooker, that he has refined his control of the
mixer so that he can play in a responsive fashion:
I’ve played it for so many years that I can control
it [...] I have a large amount of control over
the mixer. I’ve just done a session with a jazz
guitarist and I pretty much managed to match
him note for note
Mira Martin-Gray also contrasts her approach to Naka-
mura’s, focusing on attitudes to expression:
[Nakamura] has talked a lot about the music
as non-expressive which is interesting, but very
much the opposite of how I feel for my own
music. I think that it’s interesting that this
weird instrument has both of those things inher-
ent in it: you can make this totally austere, non-
gestural type of music, but you can also make the
most emotional kind of music, or you can make
16kHz tones, or you can make totally bizarre
babbling craziness. (Mira Martin-Gray)
Gray discusses self-expression in contrast to a detached
Cagean rationality [14] which she associates with a pure,
absolute music or sound that separates mind from body.
She foregrounds a more corporeal approach to the mixer in
her work, and has sometimes incorporated her own voice
into her practice with the mixer.
5.3 Polyphonic no-input
The tuned, pitched, polyphonic approach described in Sec-
tion 4 provides another contrasting perspective. When per-
forming in this way, the unpredictable aspects are usually
tamed to a large extent. A trait of the mixer that appears
to appeal in this situation is the ability to carefully tune
the mixer microtonally: both Carri` ere and Saikaley express
a keen interest in working outside equal temperament. Ap-
proaching the mixing desk in this way presents a markedly
different idiom: there is no longer the potential for signifi-
cantly unexpected outcomes or the necessity for a “let it be”
approach. Instead, harmonic relationships tend to come to
the fore.
Carri` ere has performed Arvo P¨art’s Fratres using this ap-
proach7. This was a project that several other participants
had heard of, who often used it as a contrast with their
7https://vimeo.com/30074885
own work, struggling to understand the rationale for using
the no-input mixer in this context. Despite the controlled
approach to pitch, Carri` ere still finds the volatility and vis-
ceral aspects of the mixer an appealing and more personal
compared with commercial synthesisers or MIDI controllers.
5.4 Rawness
The rawness of the mixer was a common theme that emerged
from participant interviews: that it gives a sense of be-
ing in direct connection with the electricity. This blended
material-social aspect can be connected to several musical
contexts.
Feedback is a typical tool of the trade [52, 39] in industrial
noise or power electronics, and the no-input mixer’s poten-
tial for abrasive distorted bass, piercing high frequencies,
rhythmic pulses, and for signifying raw electricity seems well
suited to the aesthetics of these contexts. The “let it be”
attitude may be cast in a different light, re-framed as a hu-
man powerlessness in the face of powerful machines [39, p
179], and with the emergent dimension to the instrument’s
behaviour suiting an area of practice that is usually happy
to embrace chaos and unpredictability [39, p 23] 8.
The harshness of the sounds and the signification of raw
electricity also appear to be an aspect of the instrument
being taken up in sound design contexts. The Glitchedtones
sample pack mentioned above suggests that “perhaps the
navigational system is on the fritz while en route to Mars,
or the radio has lost its signal while the hero is stranded in
a dark forest”.
The rawness presents itself in a different fashion in Knight’s
minimal techno explorations. Here, the pared-down clicks
and tones fit neatly with the sparse aesthetic of minimal
techno. The characteristically slow pace of change and de-
velopment also seems to be a good fit for this way of working
with the mixer: when working in this style as opposed to
more of a free improvisation context, Knight is much more
careful with any changes that are made, as the piece can be
a complex balancing act of different interrelated parts.
6. CONCLUSIONS
The preceding section has explored the coming together of
particular material features of the mixer with particular cul-
tural practices and attitudes. This provides a relevant case
study for NIME of the two-way interactions between mu-
sical ideas and musical technologies. We have seen how
specific musical ideas can become associated with a tech-
nology, but also how these links are related to specific cul-
tural perspectives rather than immutable facts. An initial
attempt at engaging with a complex, messy history of the
no-input mixer has been given in sections 2 and 4 in order
to support these analyses. The affordability, accessibility,
customisability, and ergomimetic dimensions were consid-
ered as factors in the spread of the mixer, and its migration
into a variety of musical contexts.
