ABSTRACT
This short paper accounts for (a) a wearable radio receiver
that can be operated in the fashion of a monochord string
instrument, and (b) for a rotating induction coil. Technical
aspects are discussed and the process is exposed as labora-
tory experimentation with radio technologies.

1. BACKGROUND
The earliest instances of radio-inspired NIME are most likely
the Radiopiano and the Radiotone that are referenced in [10]
as being already in use on 1931. Radiotone is also a NIME
by Sancristoforo1 that employs X-Rays and a cosmic ray
detector to control music tones. Controlling music per-
formance is also the focus with the various Radio batons,
wherein radio technology is utilized to extrapolate the 3D
positioning of a stick [2]. Another continuum is concerned
with environmental radio-scapes. Kubisch designs instru-
ments that allow audiences to listen to transmitted or en-
vironmental radio signals since the 1970s. [6]. In Bowers’
Ghost Radio , demodulated radio signals control a modu-
lar synthesizer[1]. Miyazaki’s Detector allows us to listen
to (the otherwise inaudible) condition of ‘wirelessness’[7].
Hinterding’s graphite-based drawings afford the reception
of VLF signals and their playful performance[3, p. 38–39].
Other approaches zoom in the ways in which radio signals
resonate the biosphere. An Apo33 exhibition 2 zooms in ra-
dio vis-´ a-vismycelia networks, trees, and plants whileRadio
Mycelium pivots on fungal mycelia[8].

2. ANTENNA MONO-CHORD
Antenna mono-chord is a radio receiver capable of FM and
two distinct SW bands that can be ‘performed’ in a string
instrument like fashion. Rather than being the product of
some structured ideation or design process, Antenna mono-
chord has surfaced experimentation with haphazard mate-
rials lying around at the author’s studio and, as such, it
should be rather thought of as “ a record of its own mak-
ing”[5]. It follows the affordancies of a long ‘soft-pot’ slider;
it naturally found its place on a piece of wood and, given
the author’s long lasting interest in radio technologies and
his ongoing experiments at that time with Roto-ctor, the
idea of a radio receiver controlled by the former suggested
itself immediately.
The circuity is scavenged from a commercial apparatus
and subsequently tinkered with accordingly so that the soft-
pot controls its tuning and so that one may switch between
FM/SW bands via a pair of momentary lapse push-buttons.
The soft-pot is where one would expect to find a string in a
monochord instrument while the latter are where one would
typically pluck it. The instrument also features a long tele-
scopic antenna on the side, a speaker and a line-out TS
jack on the other, a battery holder and a switch to tog-
gle between speaker/line output on the back, and a leather
stripe mounted on steel hooks at the top. Components have
been glued onto the long piece of wood using mostly two-
part polyurethane adhesive and, on a few occasions, two-
part epoxy stucco. Photos 1 and 2 illustrate the resulting
instrument.
3. ROTO-CTOR
Roto-ctor is inspired by Romeroet al. inductor for ELF/VLF
monitoring[11]. Given that inductors are directional sen-
sors, electro-mechanical rotation (akin to that of radars)
suggests itself for interesting phasing effects. Such a de-
vice would also radiate over short distances. The eventual

instrument features:
• a ferrite core induction coil
• an electro-mechanical system to achieve full rotation
over 360◦
• a motor-driver controlling the rotation speed
• a line-level pre-amplifier
• transmitting circuity (in the same enclosure as above)
• a footswitch to switch between RX/TX operation
The inductor’s core comprises a series of seven Φ10 mm/L
10 cm ferroxcube type 3C90 ferrite rods. The manufacturer
ratings suggest an average permeability of µi = 2300 ±20%
at frequencies f ⩽ 10 KHz; it needs be emphasized that
µi ∝ f. As shown in Fig. 3, the rods are enclosed in shrink-
ing tube and a plastic pipe; then wrapped with 6 .5 Km of
Φ0.08 mm enamel copper wire; then more shrinking tube, a
slotted copper tube as a shield, bubble wrap, and eventually
a hard plastic tube. Thus, the resulting device is protected
from dust, liquids, physical stress, and transversal current
loops.
Rotating the inductor is a rather challenging affair in a
DIY context. The industrial grade through-bearing slip-
ring shown in Fig. 4 is used to achieve seamless rotation
without twisting any cables. A motor of appropriate char-
acteristics is selected and fastened to a stand. Motor mo-
tion needs be transferred to the inductor in a safe, stable,
and balanced manner. After trial and error, the author at-
tacked the problem in this fashion: the supporting brace
is mounted onto a M10 threaded rod going through the
slip-ring and glued half the way into a coupling nut. Three

equidistant threaded holes are opened to the other side of
this coupler that goes over the motor shaft. It is then pos-
sible to employ small screws to eliminate micro-lateral in-
clinations so as to keep everything firm and centered.
The motor-driver comprises a 1 A /12 V switching power
supply and a ready-made component driver. A diode is
used to protect the motor from back-EMF. Note that the
motor will induce its own electromagnetic signals; while this
aids to the particular character of the instrument, it needs
be controlled. Accordingly, a grounded metallic mesh is
wrapped around the motor so as to filter out most of the
produced static.
RX/TX circuity are designed and implemented directly
on a perforating board stage by stage, in a process of on-
the-fly experimentation, trial/error, testing, and measuring.
The eventual schematic is shown in Fig. 6. It requires a
linear power supply of 12 VAV /200 mA. The inductor is
measured to have a resistive impedance component RL ≈
95 Ω and a non-linear reactant one that is illustrated in
Fig. 8 (this is due to parasitic capacitance and because µi ∝
f). The inductance L is then a function of frequency f so
that for ψ ≡ fL(f), the total impedance is
ZL ≡ RL + XL = RL + 2πfψ =⇒
ZL = ζ(ψ) = (95 + 2πψ)Ω (1)
It is decided to focus on the [0 .5, 4]KHz region where it is
measured that 6 H ⩽ L ⩽ 8 H so that 1 KHz × 6 H ⩽ ψ ⩽
2 KHz × 8 H. The circuit is then optimized for an average
impedance of

Looking out of the inductor one finds two parallel back-
EMF protection stages. A couple of ‘snubber’ Schottky/
Resistor pairs in parallel provide a low impedance path to
the AC ground. With the intended power supply of 200 mA
and since Q1 is in a unity-gain configuration, the maximum

energy is L∧I2
2 = 0.16 J; for a 1 ms transient, this amounts
to 0.16 J
0.01 s = 16 W of power. Accordingly, R20/21 are rated
for 15 W while D5/6 (and all related cabling) are rated for
at least 500 mA. The second protection stage comprises
two MOVs rated at 18 VAC and a slow-burn fuse rated at
400 mA (since MOVs eventually fail with time).
A remote footswitch controls the relay switching TX/RX.
The TX stage is rather straightforward; just a MOSFET
Q1 in a common-gate configuration. Output impedance is
approximated by [12, 4.41–4.42]
ZO ≈ ro(gmRS + 1)||RD (2)
IRF9610 datasheet gives ID > 2.5 A for VDS > 24 V and
VGS ≈ 12 V[13]. In real-life, however, ID is limited to what
the power supply can offer and this should be 200 mA (and
in any case no more than 400 mA) here. Accordingly,

According to[13], gm ≈ 0.5 S for ID ≈ 0.2 A. Then, for

so that ZO = ¯ZL and so that maximum power transfer is
guaranteed.
First in the RX pipeline comes the D2||D3 pair that lim-
its the input signal roughly between ±700 mV. A three
stage amplification network comes next. It is desired to
use an audio transformer ( T1) in this circuit for its excel-
lent DC-blocking characteristics and to provide complete
electronic isolation between the inductor and audio output.
The signal is too weak to directly drive T1 however, so that
it first passes through a DC-coupled non-inverting amplifi-
cation stage with gain g = 1 + R17
R19
= 1 + 47 KΩ
15 KΩ ≈ 4. T1
in a 1 : 2 configuration provides an additional voltage gain
of g = 4. Finally, another non-inverting amplifier with gain
control provides up to 1 + R2
R1
= 1 + 50 KΩ
10 KΩ = 6 gain (when
the signal is very weak). The signal is then split and sent to
two different filter banks. Via a mechanical switch the unfil-
tered signal or the output of either of the two filter banks is
selected and, eventually converted to a balanced line signal
by means of a THAT1646 IC.
The filters have an identical topology of four series LC

10 KΩ = 2.2 to make-up for the lost gain. The filter banks
comprise 4 individual notch filters each with their resonant
frequencies at a 50 Hz and 60 Hz fundamental, respectively,
and three overtone harmonics, so that electrical hum can be
filtered worldwide. Note that the bandwidth of the notches
is directly proportion to the coils’ ESR, so that coils with
exceptionally low ESR are necessary. Figure 9 illustrates
the resulting frequency response for the 50 Hz filter, also
taking into account the measured ESR.
4. FUTURE WORK
The author is currently finalizing Vorticular Radio, i.e. an
experimental radio receiver utilizing the rudimentary parts
of an early 20th century radio receiver (DIY variable capac-
itors and coils, mineral crystal detector) and intentionally
unstable electronic circuit.
