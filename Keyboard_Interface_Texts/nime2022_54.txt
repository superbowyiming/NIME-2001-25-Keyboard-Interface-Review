ABSTRACT
Historically marginalised instruments witness and bear vital stories that can deeply 
affect identity and galvanise communities when revitalised. We present the proto-
langspil as a contemporary interpretation of the langspil, an Icelandic monochord-like 
folk instrument, and describe its agential and performative contributions to the first 
Icelandic NIME research lab. This paper describes how the proto-langspil has served 
as an instrument in establishing the research methodology of our new lab and 
concretised the research agenda via a series of encounters with music performers and 
composers, luthiers, anthropologists, musicologists, designers and philosophers. These 
encounters have informed and challenged our research practices, mapped our 
surroundings, and embedded us in the local social fabric. We share our proto-langspil 
for replication, and reflect on encounters as a methodology framing mechanism that 
eschews the more traditional empirical approaches in HCI. We conclude with a final 
provocation for NIME researchers to embrace AI research with an open mind.

Introduction
The Intelligent Instruments Lab,1 hosted by the Iceland University of the Arts,2 began 
activities in September 2021.3 We focus on the function of musical instruments imbued 
with intelligence: how these objects change the way we think about and perform 
music, particularly considering the intense and personal relationship we have with 
them. An important aspect of the project is to study the emerging discourse around 
these new instruments, and our programme involves development, user studies, Open 
Lab events,4 and live performances. These encounters allow us to obtain and share 
knowledge about the perception of new intelligent instruments. 
Setting up a new lab is a complex task, involving physical space, work practices and 
the social dynamics between researchers and collaborators [1]. Modularity and

dynamic structures are key goals in our work, equally in how we organise our space, 
work together and with others, and design instruments. We began our research by 
designing an instrument as a prototype for our research methodology. Although we are 
also working with existing instruments, such as the halldorophone[2], Magnetic 
Resonator Piano (MRP)[3] and the Linnstrument[4], we decided to develop a new 
prototype as a probe[5] that would set in place the way we brainstorm, contextualise 
theory, streamline technical work processes, and engage with project collaborators. 
Simultaneously, we designed our lab furniture as infrastructure (Image 1) that can also 
become a musical instrument, with strings and other technical elements attached.
Like Pythagoras, we began our work with the vibrating string. The string is, of course, 
a key sound source of musical instruments all over the world, with qualities such as 
regular harmonics, flexible pitch and filtering through the physical body to which it is 
attached. It is a technical element that has been with us for millennia, but our 
understanding of it is continually developing, demonstrating how knowledge often lies

outside the theoretical realm and is embedded in our designed objects [6][7]. Our 
intent was not to design a new and better string instrument — there are plenty good 
ones already! — but to bring all our attention to a focus on the properties of one string. 
This focus on the string is no coincidence: the monochord has served as a scientific 
instrument in physics and music theory since the start of writing, with the ancient 
Greeks famously developing their understanding of rational numbers, and geometry 
using the string as an epistemic tool [8]. We set out to continue this tradition with 
current technologies in artificial intelligence and dynamical systems.
Background
The Langspil
The monochord exists in most musical cultures, suffice to mention the kanon (or “law”) 
in classical Greece, the Middle Eastern qanun (also “law” in Arabic), Japanese koto and 
Indian vina where it often appears with more than one string [9]. The Icelandic version 
of the monochord is called langspil. The instrument has one to six strings, where some 
are used as drone strings. In earlier instruments, the fingerboard typically used a 
diatonic scale tuned in just intonation (Image 2). This led to it being considered an 
imperfect instrument by musicians accustomed to the equal tempered piano, and 
described as “intolerable” in the early 19th century. Soon after, langspils began to be 
made with chromatic fingerboards under the influence of Icelandic students bringing 
music theory back from their studies in Europe, mainly Copenhagen ([10], p 122-124).
The langspil’s history is somewhat muted and covert. It is centuries old and of 
unknown origin but has seen a revival in recent years, with our collaborator Eyjólfsson 
contributing a thesis [11] and programme where Icelandic school children build and 
play the langspil. Eyjólfsson advocates that the langspil be revived and re-
contextualised, stating that the “instrument that used to resonate in the dark living

rooms of the countryside [Image 3] now typically resides in glass cubicles soaked in 
fluorescent lights” [11] of museums. The Icelandic langspil was marginalised by the 
hegemony of Danish culture in many ways akin to how the Basque txalaparta was by 
Spanish culture.5 We have earlier worked on the reinterpretation of traditional 
instruments in the contemporary technological context and in the Digital Txalaparta 
project [12] we see a traditional instrument with similarly murky history revitalised by 
experimentation. One of our expert langspil collaborators warned that novel 
intervention can “easily pave over” the older tradition, whilst another pointed out that 
the langspil “doesn’t belong to any tradition, and that it shouldn’t belong to one, 
because there is none.” We encourage people to collaborate closely, listen carefully, 
and tread softly with respect into areas like these. 
Feedback Instruments
Feedback has been a technical means in lutherie since the advent of electric 
instruments. In the 1950s and 60s feedback become a conceptual focus, inspired by

developments in cybernetics. The ideas of Ashby, Bateson and Wiener were picked up 
by artists around the world and cyberneticians such as Gordon Pask6 also engaged in 
artistic productions. Artists began to work seriously with cybernetics, for example 
Bebe and Louis Barron [13].7 Composers including David Tudor, Max Neuhaus, Eliane 
Radigue, John Cage, Robert Ashley, and Alvin Lucier experimented with feedback in 
their music. It also became iconic in popular music via for example the performances 
of Jimi Hendrix.
A recent example is the halldorophone [2], a cello-like feedback instrument offering 
detailed control over each of its eight strings, which are amplified and returned into 
the body via transducer. The proto-langspil employs the same method to both “play 
itself” and respond in a nuanced way to the player. By varying these in different 
measures, we can sidestep definitions of intelligence to focus on how players perceive 
agency in an “intelligent instrument”.
Intelligence and Agency
Our current approach to intelligent instruments is broad and not confined to the latest 
developments in deep learning, although this would be included. We are rather 
interested in looking at intelligence from the perspective of the performer, asking 
under what conditions does a human performer attribute intelligence or agency in a 
technical object, such as a musical instrument? From this perspective, many of our 
historical musical instruments are already intelligent, but when their internal states 
can be autonomously and dynamically transformed, we see a jump into a new world of 
possibilities that extend the instruments’ current potential.  
The instrument we used in our initial investigations is described in the next section. 
The proto-langspil is a platform where we explore the socio-technical implications of 
creative AI applied to physical musical instruments. We are exploring how machine 
learning can be part of the ecosystem of embedded AI, with implications on how we 
would implement these processes on the halldorophone and other instruments, where 
creative AI can be part of the signal chain. From this perspective, the proto-langspil 
connects us with input from experts and becomes a platform where we investigate how 
simple changes to software can get people to attribute agency to an object, and begin 
to study of anthropomorphic language around technical objects.
Instrument Design
The proto-langspil was designed with considerations of openness, potential for 
augmentation and customisation, and ambiguity of function. Its aesthetic is unfinished

[14], prototypical (hence proto-langspil), and technologised compared to a traditional 
langspil (Image 4). We un-crafted [15] the langspil to make it conceptually, musically 
and technically malleable [16]. It was still meant to be recognised as a langspil to a 
familiar Icelandic audience, so as to provoke re-thinking of the instrument’s potential. 
One reason for designing such an instrument was to refrain from any imaginary 
musicality that established instruments connote: it is well known how instruments 
carry particular cultures and skills of playing. The proto-langspil presented a unique 
chance to present players with an object that carries very little cultural and historical 
baggage, and with references to a historical instrument that most Icelanders are only 
vaguely aware of. Parts list, detailed build instructions, design files and software can 
all be found at a repository.8

The proto-langspil was designed in the Fusion 360 3D software package (see iframe 
embed above) and laser cut in 3 and 6mm thick birch laser plywood (laserply). It has a 
fingerboard with moveable frets for the melodic string and two additional sympathetic 
drone strings (Image 5). The frets are UV resin 3D printed. Three Cycfi Nu pickups are 
placed under each string and routed to a Bela Mini for digital intervention (Image 6). 
The processed signal is routed to a power amp feeding into a tactile transducer built 
into the instrument, and there is a patch-out (full normalled, 1/4” jack) of the master 
signal before it reaches the power amp. A volume pedal can then control the master 
signal feeding back into the instrument, which is an important control parameter 
allowing for further audio processing. 
The instrument has slots for easy mechanical fitting of brackets to hold external 
modules for interaction with the strings (e.g. eBow, more pickups, automated 
plectrum). We limited the physical dimensions of the instrument to the size of 110

Eurorack HP (horizontal pitch units, approximately 559mm) with Eurorack mounting 
holes, to invite signal chain experimentation with modular synth systems. We applied 
software between the pickup and transducer to affect instrumental behaviour. This 
differed between the various encounters described later, where software design 
descriptions are provided.
Methodology
Our design process involved discussing basic elements with collaborators in computer 
science, philosophy, musicology, and cultural anthropology, conscious of the 
performative nature [17] of lab work, mindful of social relations [18] and the politics of 
technical decisions [19]. Treating our lab as an experimental system [20], the 
development of the proto-langspil became a method of formalising our working 
methods. We also hosted weekly Open Lab sessions, where anyone could join for 
discussion, allowing us to externalise our thinking and work-in-progress. To us, these 
activities made the proto-langspil a “boundary object” [21], a term standardising how 
researchers from different disciplines, or social worlds, can collaborate in research 
through a grounded platform.
We apply phenomenological methods in our study of musical instruments, and are 
interested in the language that people use to describe their experiences. This is 
centred around our notion of the encounter, described by Deleuze as “[s]omething in 
the world that forces us to think,” [22], a phenomenon that is prior to cognition of 
recognition, an object that evokes imagination, sensibility, memory, and thought. We 
are interested in this unique moment when a person encounters a new instrument for 
the first time; grasping, feeling, touching, listening, and building a mental map of its 
ergodynamics [23]. We emphasise this framing to acknowledge the particular unease 
in the NIME community towards typical user study schemes common in HCI, that do 
not reach deep enough with issues of culture, aesthetics, history and trans-ergonomic 
design [24].
Our encounters were designed to perform broad initial explorations of major research 
questions and themes of our lab. We sought different types; brief versus long, 
controlled versus in-the-wild and open-ended. We also sought to iterate on the proto-
langspil as a platform for AI experimentation. These encounters fell into four groups 
numbered E0-E3, which are described hereafter:

Encounters
Encounter 0: Open Labs and preliminary discussions
Our first meeting with the instrument was when Úlfarsson made a prototype in 
bookbinding board. Discussions involved size, shape, cultural connotations, modularity 
(how does the instrument fit with other systems, for example Eurorack?) and feel. 
Following this, we assembled the instrument in laserply, with strings, fretboard and 
tuners. In our Open Lab we would present the instrument to our visitors (Image 7), 
noting comments and learning from their insights. For us, this demonstrates how the 
emphasis on formal approaches can exclude various valuable information. 
We also presented the work to professional luthiers Hans Jóhannsson, an expert violin 
luthier, and Eyjólfur Eyjólfsson, a langspil luthier and an anthropologist of music. For 
us Jóhannsson’s comment that “the instrument body is just a filter” for the string was 
quite enlightening and inspiring thinking of how to shape that filter with materials and 
algorithms. Eyjólfsson’s was interested in cultural implications, and how proto-
langspils could be incorporated into the tradition. Folk musician Linus Orri also 
contributed valuable insights into tunings, scales and historical developments of the 
instrument.
E1: Between six musicians and the proto-langspil in four different software 
configurations, in a timed exploration format, followed by a survey.
E2: Between six different musicians, the proto-langspil, and a video and score of a 
short composition for the instrument. Musicians were given 25 minutes to explore 
the instrument and try to reproduce the piece.
E3: Between three musicians and the proto-langspil, in a take-home format, where 
they could work with the instrument over a two week period.

Encounter 1: Exploration of instrument behaviours
In this encounter, we were interested in exploring what the notions of “agency” and 
“intelligence” mean to people in the context of musical instruments. Musicians briefly 
explored an updated proto-langspil (Image 8) with four different software settings (S1-
4) representing different qualities of agency, each implemented as a SuperCollider 
synth9 (Image 9):
S1: no runaway feedback, just an amplified string instrument; responds only to the 
player.
S2: stable droning feedback; can be muted by the player and responds in a fairly 
deterministic way to playing.
S3: unstable feedback with complex pitch-shifting; can be influenced by the player 
but only partially controlled.
S4: silent when plucked, chaotic when touched and feedback when left alone; resists 
the player.

Six local musicians were filmed playing the proto-langspil and answered a survey. Each 
musician had three minutes per setting, and three encountered the settings in reverse 
order (S4-1).  They answered a Likert scale questionnaire, asking them about the felt 
sense of agency (Image 10). Though not statistically significant, we can make several 
qualitative observations consistent with the data. Some participants immediately 
began making music, some methodically explored the affordances of the instrument, 
and some attempted to reverse-engineer it. Participants generally reported feeling 
immersed in the task (Image 10, bottom left).

We were enquiring if our intuitions about the degree of agency between settings would 
be validated or challenged by the participants. Evaluations of statements ascribing 
intelligence, autonomy, self-control and surprise instrument did appear to vary 
positively with the setting number, and their opposites negatively. Participants mostly 
agreed they were in control of S1, which was not controlling itself (Image 10, 
rightmost column). Meanwhile, participants agreed that S4 had “agency” and 
“intelligence”  (Image 10, top left). 
We judged S3 to have greater agency than S2, and this was borne out by participants’ 
answers (Image 10, second column). However, the relationship between S2 and S3 was 
unclear or reversed for the questions about “intelligence” and “control”. The former 
provoked wide disagreements: E1P1 strongly agreed that S3 “had an intelligence of its 
own” while E1P6 strongly disagreed; E1P3 strongly agreed that S1 and S2 “had no 
intelligence” while E1P1 strongly disagreed. This seems to suggest either different 
experiences by different participants, or disagreement about what “intelligence” 
means. Nevertheless, we found broad similarity between the responses on intelligence 
and agency, with a strong correlation between responses.10 This is unsurprising given 
that participants were offered little time to consider their own definitions of “agency”

and “intelligence”. E1P5 put it: “I had such a hard time really pinpointing what was 
meant with that [agency] … are you asking me ‘How much AI is going on in this 
setting?’”
This encounter validated our most basic assumption: that a passive instrument which 
reacts transparently to touch is perceived as less agential than one which reacts in a 
surprising and oppositional way. But between these extrema, the picture is more 
complicated. The methodology of this encounter—comparing between instrument 
behaviours with varying agential qualities—looks promising. However, improved 
survey instruments and experimental design will need to pull apart nebulous terms like 
“intelligence” and “agency” into the specific, and culturally situated, behaviours which 
constitute them.
Encounter 2: Learning a short composition
Another theme of our research is the impact of agential instruments on embodied 
musical skill acquisition. To investigate this, a second pilot study was designed where 
musicians would explore the instrument for 10 minutes, and subsequently learn and 
reproduce a short composition by Davíð Brynjar Franzson for up to 20 minutes. A 
software setting similar to S2 and S3 from Encounter 1 was used, with tweaks by the 
composer, who was asked to focus on simple techniques, of which four were 
demonstrated:
The piece alternated between a two-hand technique (TL1 + TR1) and a left hand 
technique (TL2 or TL3). TL1 and TR1 were explicitly annotated in the score (Image 
11). Six local musicians, none of whom participated in Encounter 1, responded to a call 
to play the proto-langspil. A video performance was projected onto a wall, and a 
printed score was provided. A short discussion took place afterwards, enquiring about 
the experience.
TL1: Muting a drone string at a harmonic node with the thumb of the left hand.
TL2: Fretting the melodic string with a single finger of the left hand.
TL3: Fretting the melodic string with two fingers of the left hand simultaneously.
TR1: Pitch-bending the melodic string behind the bridge with a finger of the right 
hand.

Two participants were able to mostly reproduce the piece: E2P1 spent longest on the 
task and viewed the video the most times. E2P6 studied the score for the longest time 
and was the only participant to reproduce all four techniques. E2P4 and E2P5 chose to 
stop due to issues 1 and 3: “It feels like I’m playing another instrument than in the 
video in a way […] You have to wait for this vibration to start.” E2P2 and E2P3 were 
not confident with the task, pessimistic that they would learn the piece in the time 
provided. E2P2 mentioned: “This is my first kind of non-traditional score […] it would 
take me a bit more time to get the hang of it.”
Several participants described an initial sense of failing to understand the instrument 
giving way to more direct engagement. E2P2: “First I thought I’m not understanding 
this […] but then I stopped thinking about that and tried to listen for the sounds and 
that’s when I started to get more into it.” E2P3 recounted a sense of dialogue with the 
instrument: “I was like ‘I’m probably not doing this right’ […] but after a while I 
realised that it was answering back to me.” Participants also remarked on an 
impression of variety or nondeterminism, E2P4 positively (“it was interesting that 
[tapping the strings next to the bridge] was different each time”) and E2P5 in 
reference to task difficulty (“It was hard to imitate [the proto-langspil] because it  
makes different sounds, it’s really independent”).
These comments suggest that playing an agential instrument is about feeling patterns 
in complex behaviour, distinct from traditional instruments with more fixed behaviours. 
Despite this, our learning task rewarded a careful analysis of the video and score, 
while confounding a more embodied approach. This encounter was about embodied 
skill acquisition, but skill can only exist within the context of a practice, something that 
does not exist for most NIMEs. The composition in this encounter represented the 
beginnings of a proto-langspil practice, from which we deduced some skills. However, 
these were not explicit enough in the materials to make evaluation of learning 
possible. To improve this encounter, we would make higher quality pedagogical 
resources for these skills, so that detailed study of learning with agential instruments 
can take place.
1. The instrument was self-resonating from the beginning, but this was not notated in 
the score, nor was it obvious how to reach this initial state.
2. The viewing angle of the video relative to the instrument made it difficult to see the 
individual strings.
3. The instrument was set up on a table, which increased lower frequency resonance 
which the participants could not replicate.

Encounter 3: Take-home for artistic practice
Based on feedback from Encounters 1 and 2, three more proto-langspils were built 
(Image 13) and loaned to three participants for them to explore musically, dubbed 
E3P1-3 in this Encounter. Two were participants in Encounter 1 (E1P1, E1P4) and the 
third was an author of this work. E3P1 was selected due to being a multi-
instrumentalist string player and a folk musician. At their request, E3P1’s proto-
langspil was modified to be playable in an upright position like a cello. E3P2 was 
selected due to being an electric langspil maker themselves, and an expert on 
Icelandic folk music. E3P3 was selected so that as authors we would have direct 
artistic engagement with the proto-langspil. At the end of their take-home periods, 
each participant visited the lab to share improvisations, and to discuss and reflect on 
their experiences.
E3P1 improvised once with frets and once without, and interpreted the traditional 
Icelandic lullaby Móðir mín í kví, kví at our suggestion. They also improvised on an ad-
hoc basis with an additional proto-langspil wired into the feedback loop, about which

they “felt intrigued, excited, curious, a bit intimidated, confused” afterwards. E3P1 
described that with two proto-langspils, “the instrument was completely leading, I was 
the second player”, and that “it did what I do, which is it follows me for a bit and then 
it gets bored and does something else”. When the feedback amount (controlled by foot 
pedals) was at its maximum, they described the proto-langspils as “self-assured” and 
“independent”, and they turned this down at points “for my own expression”. They saw 
a traditional langspil as “at your disposal”, serving the player, versus the two proto-
langspils which were “more collaborative” and didn’t “need” the player to make sound.

E3P2’s musical practice was limited by the frets (“too much variability”) and speaker 
(“I wanted to hear a fuller sound”), and they couldn't “make it interesting enough” 
without guitar pedals. As a luthier however, they were inspired by aspects the proto-
langspil’s baroque bridge (“a really smart way to solve the problem of wanting to be 
able to play each string individually”) and the combination of a hollow body with 
electric pickups. Notably, when their proto-langspil’s code was explained to them, 
E3P2 declared “it’s not AI, it’s not intelligent […] it is mechanical”. For E3P2, the proto-
langspil “serves a completely different purpose” to others, and “you could just turn it 
on and listen to it”. Comparing to other langspils, they commented that the proto-
langspil “is so alien, so obviously new, it’s so obviously experimental that you’re not 
gonna step on any toes”, acknowledging despite this that we “could totally have done 
this without consulting anyone, but you are”.

E3P3’s experiments with the proto-langspil involved reprogramming it in 
SuperCollider. At one point they expressed wanting “to let the instrument be, and 
control it from the code […] to just have minimum interaction with it”, but also

described “the fun of tuning the fretboard into different tunings. Moving the frets 
around”. E3P3 also gave an improvisatory rendition of Móðir mín í kví, kví. Despite 
their intimate familiarity with the workings of the proto-langspil, E3P3 retained the 
impression “that the instrument was alive”, writing that “Pickering’s [25] phrase of 
‘dance of agency’ plays well here, where the music would be not mine, not the 
instrument’s but something that happened as a result of the interaction.” Compared to 
other digital-acoustic instruments, E3P3 wrote that “what made the experience with 
the proto-langspil quite unique for me was its ‘standalone’ nature, there are no 
soundcards, laptops or cables around.” They further identified the potential of AI 
instruments in “objects that behave unpredictably, yet [are] shapable and controllable”.

We noted a sharp contrast between E3P1, who anthropomorphised the instrument and 
approached it on its own terms, and E3P2, who tried to infer how it worked and tried 
various strategies to get the desired behaviour from it. E3P3 (of course quite invested 
in the project) seemed to bridge both attitudes, embracing the instrument as agential 
despite the total lack of mystery from their vantage.
Discussion
Though embedded feedback instruments already existed prior to this work, such as the 
Piezothing,11 to our knowledge our proto-langspil is the first such instrument to be 
published as open source, and designed to be maker-friendly and modular from the 
start. In this regard, we align our work with those calling for more replicability and 
better documentation of NIMEs [26] [27]. Future work could involve assessing the 
proto-langpsil’s technical replicability [28] and any maker ecology that develops 
around it [29]. However, in this work we mainly prioritised minimising risk towards the 
langspil tradition, about which Eyjólfsson commented: “there is no danger [with the 
proto-langspil] because as I see it, cultural heritage is something for us to play with, 
recreate, and the more alien landscapes we make the better.” 
Looking across our encounters, E3P1’s experience of the proto-langspil’s frets 
suggests that, where an instrument is only partially agential, its features could be 
divided into agential and non-agential categories, and the balance between these

might be connected to perceived agency as investigated in Encounter 1. In terms of 
Encounter 2, E3P1 took the instrument the furthest in terms of musical practice: 
studies of E3P1’s embodiment, or of others learning from them, might be possible in 
future. E3P2 was influenced by the proto-langspil’s physical features but not its 
software; understanding what the code did changed their perception greatly. Together 
with E3P3’s experience as a coder, this suggests that it is important to account for the 
relationship between the perception of an agential instrument, and the level of 
understanding about it.
We explored the proto-langspil as a boundary object [21], and doing so has given us 
insights from a wide variety of perspectives early in the proto-langspil’s development. 
Combining small scale studies and “art-research inquiry” [30] in our “machinic 
encounters” [31] has allowed us to begin to see promising connections, between the 
music interaction affordances and sensorimotor disruptions [32] of nonlinear dynamics 
[33][34], and their impact on advanced skill learning [35], AI mind perception in the 
case of E3P1 [36][37], and AI expectation violation in the case of E3P2 [38]. However, 
we did so in only very short glimpses, and with an extremely limited vocabulary.
Our own luthier, Halldor Úlfarsson, has reflected upon this in their work for over a 
decade in developing halldorophones [ 2 ] . Úlfarsson has favoured a method of 
prolonged encounters with their instruments, leaving them with musicians to become 
familiar with in their own setting, often for months and years. For him, the most 
meaningful insights about the halldorophone have come from users who work with the 
instrument for more than a year. Úlfarsson observes that it takes a while for musicians 
to stop looking at the luthier for cues about what a new instrument is and start looking 
at the instrument itself, at which point you sense a shift in confidence from the 
musician in their stated intuitions and feelings about the instrument and they give you 
more meaningful information. As lutherie itself takes time and perseverance [39], it is 
clear that if we are to design agential instruments we need this kind of long-running 
conversation with musicians and composers. We therefore see the need for more 
longer durational encounters in our work, as our lab progresses.
Though this paper has reviewed multiple small scale encounters with differing 
agendas, since we are a new lab, our main question has been “how does one research 
intelligent instruments?” Technological challenges aside, we believe the qualitatively 
different and divergent expectations that people have about intelligent instruments 
makes this research deeply complex. Although NIME evaluation studies require 
informed consent from participants, it is nevertheless typical to present NIMEs

without explanation so as to “control” aspects of user perception, for methodological 
reasons. We encourage the NIME community to reflect on and revise the scientific, 
ethical and moral justifications for these practices when it comes to agential and 
intelligent instruments. As an emerging technology, AI is present in the public 
conscious in an unprecedented way, and everyone has experience-backed questions, 
doubts, hopes, and fears about it [40]. Instead, why not design explainable, 
interpretable and self-revealing intelligent instruments [41], and include this in their 
evaluation?
Conclusions
The proto-langspil has provided a shared focus to lab members and served as a 
boundary object that has shaped the interdisciplinary work practices of our lab. Kick-
starting a lab with a project that involves collaborative ideation, building, coding, 
testing, engaging with users, composers, performers, and academics has enabled us to 
test and define our collaboration interaction protocol and refined the way we work 
with external partners. The instrument has served as a platform for both theoretical 
work in the phenomenology and perception of musical instruments as well as technical 
work in fablab technology and embedded AI.
The first sessions when people first encountered the proto-langspil gave us 
methodological insights into how to develop user studies of new musical devices 
through these encounters. We emphasised discussions, explorations, testing, 
performing, and learning from each other as the instrument developed day-by-day. 
Furthermore, the materiality of the instrument and its electric components shaped our 
ideas as much as our conversations with visitors. We note the importance of 
performance, practise, and development of the instrument by the researchers 
themselves for deeper understanding in interpreting study data. Only through deep 
engagement with the instrument is it possible to ask questions that make sense to the 
users and are actually coupled to the way the instrument works. Our encounters are a 
methodological stage that will later support more formal user studies, and it is our 
conviction that to produce a useful user study which closely fits the instrument and the 
ideas it embodies, these encounters are necessary.  
Finally, working on a traditional instrument has been a rewarding approach for us in 
the lab. It has connected our work to the cultural imaginary of the langspil, reaching 
back to its obscure past and into the undefined future. By working on an existing 
instrument, implementing intelligent and agential behaviour, we have met key people 
in the community and contributed to the ongoing revival of the local folk instrument.

We emphasise the respect and sensitivity required in order not to overwrite or step on 
the toes of tradition, the importance of listening to experts, to the instrument, to the 
past. 
Acknowledgments
This work has been a collaborative endeavour by all lab members, from initial 
instrument design to writing of this paper. Roughly speaking, Thor Magnusson 
arranged and hosted the discussions with langspil experts, Halldor Úlfarsson designed 
and built the proto-langspil, Victor Shepardson created the proto-langspil’s software,

Ethics Statement
This project is funded by the ERC and before embarking upon our study we sought 
ethical clearance from the Icelandic Science Ethics Committee. The committee 
considered our research questions, methods, recruitment strategies, and treatment of 
personal data. In the study we sought to maintain diversity and equal representation. 
We recruited participants for the study from a group of people who had been attending 
our weekly Open Lab sessions on Friday afternoons, so they were familiar with the lab 
and its people. Study participants were given information and consent sheets to sign 
and it was made clear to them that they could quit the study at any point in time. All 
personal information is kept safely and anonymously. 
The proto-langspil has been released as open source, including the files for laser 
cutting the instrument, the electric schemata, the technical spec and the software 
patches on the embedded computer. All composed scores for the instrument will be 
released on the instrument’s webpage.
