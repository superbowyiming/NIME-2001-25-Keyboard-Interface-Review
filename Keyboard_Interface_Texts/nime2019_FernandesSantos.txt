ABSTRACT
During the musical performance, expert musicians consciously
manipulate acoustical parameters expressing their interpre-
tative choices. Also, players make physical motions and,
in many cases, these gestures are related to the musicians’
artistic intentions. However, it’s not clear if the sound ma-
nipulation reﬂects in physical motions.
The understanding of the musical structure of the work
being performed in its many levels may impact the projec-
tion of artistic intentions, and performers alter it in micro
and macro-sections, such as in musical motifs, phrases and
sessions. Therefore, this paper investigates the timing ma-
nipulation and how such variations may reﬂect in physical
gestures.
The study involved musicians (ﬂute, clarinet, and bas-
soon players) performing a unison excerpt by G. Rossini.
We analyzed the relationship between timing variation (the
Inter Onsets Interval deviations) and physical motion based
on the traveled distance of the ﬂute under diﬀerent condi-
tions. The ﬂutists were asked to play the musical excerpt in
three experimental conditions: (1) playing solo and playing
in duets with previous recordings by other instrumentalists,
(2) clarinetist and (3) bassoonist.
The ﬁnding suggests that: 1) the movements, which seem
to be related to the sense of pulse, are recurrent and stable,
2) the timing variability in micro or macro sections reﬂects
in gestures’ amplitude performed by ﬂutists.

ness and softness), intonation, sound color, and note artic-
ulation, and consequently, these modiﬁcations are methods
with which musicians convey their musical intentions [8,
12, 13]. By changing parameters of sound, a performer can
completely alter the performance of a musical piece through
the way it is expressed [7, 20]. Researchers have tended to
focus on methods that describe the expressive intentions in
music performance, by analysing the manipulation of sound
[19, 7, 21], considering the deviation in sound parameters.
A review of the literature on this topic shows that timing
variation is an useful parameter to approach the music ex-
pressiveness [19, 14, 5]. Therefore, we opted to study the
timing variability due to its notoriety in the overall percep-
tion of expressiveness.
According to [23], there are two essential principles for
communicating musical structure: (1) diﬀerentiation of pitch
and duration; (2) grouping of notes in phrasing, metrical
units, or harmonic areas. In other words, the author ex-
plains that the perception is enhanced by increasing the
diﬀerence between categories, such as stretching notes or
playing short notes even shorter (duration contrast), beyond
the variation of the sound’s energy as changing dynamics of
the sound.
The timing deviation includes horizontal and vertical re-
lations between sounds. The vertical timing variations af-
fect the degree of synchronization of audio in separated
parts within the ensemble texture. Meanwhile, the hori-
zontal connections concern the timing of successive sounds
within each voice or instrumental part. Both aspects modify
the harmonic and melodic music features, but, in this study,
we only focused on timing deviation in a simple melodic
line. A standard mode of horizontal deviation requires in-
tentionally varying the length of metric inter-beat intervals
to produce systematic modulations in local tempo [8].
Although the timing deviation invariably occurs, it is not
produced randomly nor just as a sound eﬀect. The hori-
zontal timing variations are exceptionally consistent across
performances of a piece by the same musician [22, 28], and
performers who interpret music quite diﬀerently might pro-
duce similar patterns of timing and dynamics [19].
In the literature many works [27, 26, 24, 4, 17, 16, 3, 10,
20] have demonstrated that body movements, other than
being essential to sound production on the instrument, in
many cases, ancillary gestures are also closely related to the
performers’ artistic intentions. According to [18], the study
of gesture in music is an important area of research that
raises many issues about perception, performance, and emo-
tional communication. The authors point out that move-
ments are part of performance but not necessarily produce
sound. Ancillary gestures have been recognized essential to
the instrumentalist’s performance, considering that some of
them are stable and reproducible, even after extended pe-
riods. Therefore, the repeatable movement patterns might
292
have a communicative function in enhancing the perceivers’
experience of the sound’s phrasing [11], being intimately
connected to the structure of the music.
Studies in psycholinguists point to gestures in speakers
come about as a by-product of changes in speech [9], and
we hypothesise that gestures can express the way which
performers understand and convey the musical structure.
According to [15], the concept of music embodiment is a
process in which the human body is a mediator between
the musical mind and the physical environment, and the
gestures would be the way in which the body extends itself
in space and time. The researcher explains that gestures
are part of synchronisation and entrainment of the body
and the meaning of the emotional engagement as well as
deliberate actions.
More recently, scholars have been researching the rela-
tionship between physical motion and interpretation choices
of music’s structure [24, 20], aiming at investigating the an-
cillary gestures and musical phrase organisation. In [10],
cellists were asked to play two versions of a musical ex-
cerpt, with shorts and long melodic groupings speciﬁed, and
although the performer’s heads move more frequently when
they play shorts groupings compared to long units grouping,
the motion modiﬁed across diﬀerent sections of the excerpt.
Here we want to examine the connection between ancil-
lary motion and interpretative choices, during a musical per-
formance. Importantly, our approach considers the artistic
choices by musicians and how instrumentalists adapt a mu-
sical situation as ensemble practice. Therefore, we designed
an experiment in which involved expert ﬂutists playing a
musical excerpt in three diﬀerent conditions: (1) playing
solo and playing in duets with previous recordings by other
instrumentalists, (2) clarinetist and (3) bassoonist. These
recordings were performed by musicians who manipulated
the timing by their own interpretative choices, and conse-
quently, each one expressed his/her musical idea organisa-
tion. Importantly, our work focus on how ﬂute players per-
formed the musical excerpt while they were asked to play
in diﬀerent timing variation. In other words, we analysed
the physical motion and timing deviations interpreted by
ﬂutists during three experimental conditions. It is impor-
tant to note that these are data from an earlier study devel-
oped in my Ph.D. dissertation, but this paper only focuses
on a part of the study with an incremental discussion.
We believe that analysing modiﬁcations in the musical
phrases and physical gestures can be a strategy to under-
stand how performers communicate the musical structure.
2. DATA COLLECTION
We collected the acoustical and physical data as part of this
study intending at investigating the relation between sound
manipulation and bodily/instrumentally motion, during a
music performance. In this section, we will provide com-
prehensive details about the experimental methodology.
2.1 Participants, Material and Equipment
We recruited six expert musicians, four ﬂutists, one clar-
inetist, and one bassoonist, all of them having at least 30
years of musical training. Other observations indicate that
experienced performers acquire ability throughout the years
to achieve high goals without the need for spurious gestures.
Also, the level of diﬃculty and demands for a certain level
of excellence usually creates a need for more movement from
the performer, especially for beginners.
The design of the experiment was based on sound and
motion manipulation performed by musicians in a musical
interpretation. Therefore, instrumentalists were asked to
play four times the excerpt in solo condition, and after that,
just ﬂutists were invited to perform in duets with the pre-
vious recordings of clarinet and bassoon. For reference, a
metronome produced a steady tempo at 67 bpm (beats per
minute) before each take. The resulting included a total of
48 takes: 16 solo takes, and 32 takes in duet.
We used a musical excerpt which was extracted from the
second movement of Wind Quartet No. 2, in G Major for
ﬂute, clarinet, bassoon, and horn by Gioachino Rossini. For
our experiment, we adapted the score to two duets, ﬂute
with clarinet and ﬂute with bassoon (ﬁgure 1). Having
a unison performance enabled us to present a real perfor-
mance situation that requires musicians to adjust to the
partner at each note.

parts extracted from the second movement of Wind
Quartet No. 2, in G Major by G. Rossini.
The audio was captured by an omnidirectional micro-
phone (M-Audio Solaris) at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz.
The microphone was located approximately 1 to 1.5 me-
ters from the source, given that musicians could move dur-
ing their performances. The physical motion was recorded
with the NDI Optotrak Certus motion capture device, at a
sampling rate of 100 frames per second. Markers were po-
sitioned on musicians’ body and instrument. The cameras
were placed vertically, 3 meters away from the musicians.
Figure 2 shows the data acquisition setup and the adopted
coordinate system: x-axis as lateral displacement, y-axis as
height, and z-axis as depth. A clapper-board was used in
order to synchronize audio and movement data.
2.2 Procedure
The study procedure had two main sessions: the solo ses-
sion and the duets session. At the beginning of the study,
all of the participants were asked to play the excerpt with
his/her interpretative intentions, four times. That is, musi-
cians performed as if in a real practice situation, in which
they should play their artistic choices featuring the solo ses-
sion.
Afterward, the clarinetist and bassoonist were requested
to indicate the preferred recordings to be followed by ﬂutists
in duets session. In this session, the ﬂute players were asked
to accompany both tapes in the best way they could, adjust-
ing their playing to the ensemble partner’s interpretation.
In addition, ﬂutists performed with a headphone in one ear
listening to, separately, the clarinet and the bassoon perfor-
mances, more four times each. Audio-Technica ATH-M50
headphones were used in only one ear, leaving the other

ear free for the ﬂutist to listen to his/her sound, creating
a semi-closed situation. Through the use of headphone, we
were able to record each instrument independently.
Finally, additional self-reports were performed on with
ﬂutists about his/her phrase grouping and sound manipu-
lation during their performance. The interviews aiming at
supporting possible correspondence between the interpreta-
tive choices identiﬁed during the analysis.
3. ANALYSIS
We were interested in assessing the ﬂutists’ interpretative
choices playing in solo and duets condition, especially the
timing variability and how such variations may reﬂect in
physical movement. From the data collected, we analysed
the relation between timing manipulation and motion, com-
paring the traveled distance of the foot joints ﬂute and the
Inter Onsets Intervals (IOI) deviations during the three ex-
perimental conditions.
In order to analyse the audio data, we segmented it into
musical notes, and this process was accomplished semi- au-
tomatically with the use of EXPAN. This tool was devel-
oped at CEGeME (Center for Research on Gesture, Music
& Expression) for musical expressiveness analysis [1], which
combines pitch and amplitude values to detect note on-
set/oﬀset, end of attack, and beginning of release. A Sonic
Visualizer plugin [2] developed within the EXPAN toolbox
was also used for possible inspection and adjustment of the
segmentation parameters.
To assess the timing variation, the sound descriptor IOI
(Inter-Onsets-Intervals) was used. This method measures
the variation of the length of metric inter-beat intervals and
features systematic modulations in local tempo. Therefore,
one possible way to analyse the timing variability is to in-
vestigate the change of IOI.
The inter-onsets-intervals are based on the note onsets ob-
tained from the audio signals, and in this study, the IOI’s
are normalised to the quarter-note. The timing variabil-
ity feature, by ﬂutist 1 as example, can be seen in the ﬁg-
ures 3, in which the deviation from the line indicates the
note duration manipulated by musician. In order to inspect
the diﬀerences in participants, we also measured the time
duration as well as the timing variation in clarinetist and
bassoonist performances.
To investigate the physical motion, we analysed the move-
ment from markers positioned on the ﬂute. Previous studies
have shown that the instrument’s motion is a meaningful in-
dicator of artistic gestures performed by musicians [26, ?,
4, 24]. Therefore, in this study, ﬂute’s markers are used as
input data of mapping the ancillary gestures.
To analyse the evolution of the ﬂute tridimensional mo-
tion, we measured the traveled distance by foot joint’s ﬂute
across four takes in each experimental conditions. First,
we estimated the value of Euclidean distance, given that
it measures the positions of the markers in two subsequent
samples. Following this, we sum the total amount of range.
We opted for this unidimensional parameter because it cap-
tures a signiﬁcant amount of information from the musi-
cians’ movement.
Further, we examined the vertical motion of the ﬂute dur-
ing the musicians’ performance. Having the vertical gesture
allowed us to investigate the possible relationship between
movement and tempo, given that we can determine the note
onsets of the acoustical signal.
4. RESULTS
In this section, we point to the proﬁle of timing manipu-
lation and physical motion performed by ﬂute players. To
do so, we inspected the possible patterns during three ex-
perimental conditions which ﬂutists were asked to perform:
(1) playing solo, (2) performing in duet with a previous
recording of the clarinet, (3) playing, also in duet with the
bassoon’s recording.
Our data suggest that the local tempo is unique, given
that musicians, invariably, adjust it during their perfor-
mances. In other words, the tempo is continuously mod-
ulated given the asymmetric distribution of IOI durations
caused by accelerandi and ritardandi at musical structural
boundaries. However, the stability of timing proﬁle could
be assessed across the repeated performances, as well as the
mean global tempo performed by musicians may character-
ize the individual timing manipulation.
Comparing instrumentalists performances based on du-
ration in seconds, we assess a diﬀerence between clarinetist
and bassoonist performances. Changes in time duration
were identiﬁed pointing to 14.12 seconds and 13.12 sec-
onds in which the clarinet and bassoon players, respectively.
However, the timing proﬁle shows a signiﬁcant manipula-
tion over the note duration, indicating that bassoonist and
clarinetist intentionally alter thetiming in 1) macro-sections
and 2) micro-sections, respectively.
These results showed that the clarinetist played a ritar-
dandi at the last bar (micro-section) while bassoonist ma-
nipulated the timing deviation during the excerpt (macro-
section).
In other words, the performance by clarinet player is ex-
treme enough to sound like real tempo changes between
bars 3 and 4, featuring a ﬁnal cadential. In opposition, the
bassoonist tends to respond to this musical structure by
distributing the cadential ritardandi over the entire phrase,
taking progressively more time for each bar.
294
We now consider the motion features and generally speak-
ing, the results showed there are more movement when the
ﬂutists played in duet with the clarinet than when they
were playing in solo condition. Also, the numbers point to
the decreasing or maintaining of movement’s amount when
ﬂute players are playing in duet with the bassoon, table 1.
Importantly, the ﬂutist 3 was the only exception, and we
used her self-report to discuss this ﬁnding. More details in
the next section.
The relationship between physical motion and sense of
tempo maintaining was analysed by using the vertical move-
ment. The ﬂute’s gestures highlighted the impact of rhythm
patterns based on motion features and the pulse of notes.
5. DISCUSSION
We know from previous works that performance planning
and practicing includes musicians, consciously, manipulat-
ing acoustical parameters and making decisions for grouping
notes into phrases and emphasizing harmonic and rhythmic
features [6, 8]. Both principles are not necessarily indepen-
dent, and these changes inﬂuence how the musical struc-
ture is intentionally expressed. As far as we are aware that
players make physical gestures during their performances
[4, 24, 28], and ancillary gestures are associated with the
musicians’ interpretative intentions [26, 20].
Our study with ﬂute players shows that the motion’s
quantity, performed by them, varies when they were sub-
mitted to play in diﬀerent timing variation: (1) playing in
duet with an instrumentalist performing a timing manipu-
lation in a short time interval, featuring a tempo changes
and (2) performing in duet with a musician, who tends to
distribute the timing variation in an extended time period.
We hypothesize that when ﬂutists were asked to play a
ritardandi in a micro-section, the instrument’s motion in-
creased indicating the decrease in the tempo. It may be
assumed that ﬂutists tended to adjust the apparent tempo
changes and it was reﬂected in gestures. In addition, there
is evidence to suggest that musicians tended to make contin-
ual gestures when they played with stable timing variation
duet. In other words, ﬂute players decreased or maintained
motion when they were compared between playing solo and
playing in duet with the bassoonist, considering that both
interpretations show similarities in performed timing inten-
tions proﬁle.
According to [14], phrase entries and endings present dis-
tinct challenges for ensemble coordination. The synchroni-
sation at phrase endings is a hard task because tempo may
decrease, depending on the performers’ artistic intentions,
once phrase boundaries are approached [19]. Phrase bound-
aries often coincide with structural boundaries that refer to
“points of change”. These points are characterised by in-
tense communicative interaction to produce a qualitative
change in the “feel” of the music, reﬂecting in hierarchical
relations and the boundaries of musical ideas [25].
Interestingly, previous works have shown that the verti-
cal movement may help the musician to keep track of the
tempo, and serve as a signal to other performers, dancers,
or listeners [11]. Also, the continual movement might be
necessary to keep rhythmical features related to both per-
formances and perception intact, and a common manifesta-
tion of constant motion occurs when a person taps his foot
or move his instrument. In other words, it makes sense that
motion is the maintainer and the communicator of the pulse.
Although such gestures vary considerably between instru-
mentalists and performance styles, they may be thought of
as necessary for the timing in performance [28].
The resulting vertical movement is able to indicate the
relationship between physical motion and sense of tempo
maintaining. The ﬂute’s gestures highlighted the impact
of tempo, considering that the ﬁgure 4 points to motion
features based on the onsets of notes. It reveals that the
rhythm feature has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on musicians ges-
tures.
As reported in the Results, the ﬂutist 3 was an exception,
considering that she made large gestures in duet conditions,
independently which was the instrumentalist. When ques-
tioned during self-report, she related about her principal
ﬂute position in the orchestra and revealed that she is di-
rectly aﬀected by the conductor requiring “precision” during
the performance. In her opinion, the term is reﬂected in
physical gestures which conduct the tempo “in an ensemble
performance, I need to move myself to express the tempo
for others”. This factor may be responsible for the ﬂute
player 3 has performed distinctive gestures in both duets
than in solo interpretations, making sense with her report
about motion as the transmitter of tempo.
6. CONCLUSIONS
We addressed whether the timing manipulation performed
by musicians may reﬂect in physical gestures during their
interpretations. The fact that we used an experiment in-
volving musicians performing solo and in diﬀerent duets re-
inforces the argument that the sound manipulation commu-
nicates the individual interpretative intention. The results
of timing deviation show that each performer emerges an
important idiosyncratic ability. Also, the variability of tim-
ing seems reﬂected in the continual motion of the pulse and
gesture’s amplitude, considering that these movements are
recurrent in all experimental conditions, inferring the sin-
gularity in each interpretation.
Although there is a limitation due to the small popu-
lation observed, we examined each ﬂutist separately as an
essential factor in determining individual sound and gesture
manipulation. Furthermore, we compared the three condi-
tions (playing solo, playing in duet with clarinet, and with
bassoon) and veriﬁed how each ﬂute player adjusted their
sound and motion.
Our ﬁndings so far have been very encouraging to show
that ancillary gestures can facilitate the expression of music
corroborating with previous results. Also, our study is in
line with the idea that physical motions can be so-called
phrasing gestures since it is closely connected to musical
phrasing [11]. Besides, ancillary gestures are an integral
part of the musicians’ performance as well as they are stable
and reproducible in various performances. Our work has led
us to conclude that these motions have a communicative
function in enhancing the perceivers’ experience of musical
phrasing.
In summary, our work points to an interrelationship be-
tween sound and gesture manipulation related to interpre-
tative intentions. Finally, we did not intend to conclude
that timing variation increase or decrease motion amount,
but that sound manipulation may reﬂect in physical mo-
tion. Therefore, future works will concentrate on gestures
as a method to study human cognition as well as to inves-
tigate the process of musical thinking.
