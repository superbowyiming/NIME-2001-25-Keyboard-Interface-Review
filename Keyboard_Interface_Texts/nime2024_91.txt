ABSTRACT
DoongDoong.club1 introduces a unique musical metaverse,
where participants collaboratively create real-time music
with Korean onomatopoeic and mimetic words as a distinc-
tive sound source. A line rotating clockwise on a vast disc-
shaped space scans objects and generates individual sounds
from each object. As a New Interface for Musical Expres-
sion (NIME), DoongDoong.club enables users of all musical
levels to make music in real-time collaboratively , addressing
entry barriers heightened by the rapid shift from in-person
to online collaboration during the pandemic.
This study dissects elements of DoongDoong.club to show
how they contribute to the musical metaverse. Y2K graphic
style blends optimistic futurism with a touch of 2000s nos-
talgia. Emoji-based objects play Korean onomatopoeic and
mimetic word recordings, enriching cultural and rhythmic
nuances in compositions. Additionally , DoongDoong.club’s
Cul-de-Sac aligns with 2010’s metafiction trends while show-
casing its transition into the metaverse. This exploration
emphasizes the platform’s innovative contributions, featur-
ing Korean onomatopoeic and mimetic words as a central,
unique sound element.

1. INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how people socially
network and communicate almost exclusively online. It also

impacted the field of music. Since musicians rely on sonic or
visual cues, they require audio and visual sharing platforms.
Musicians used platforms such as Zoom, Skype, and Jack-
T rip [13]. While these tools might fit music professionals
or musicians trying to rehearse traditionally , they did not
necessarily reduce the barrier to entry for non-musicians to
collaborate or function as a stand-alone musical instrument.
Meanwhile, several online collaborative music-making tools
have been created since before the pandemic. Google Chrome
Music Lab’s Shared Piano [9], BeepBox [10], and GroovePizza
[12] are the examples of them. These platforms invoke
participants interested in making music by adopting the
methods of games. However, their multiplayer collabora-
tion strategies are different from the metaverse. They work
not in real-time but rather like a relay; one following the
work of the person before. ”Musical Metaverse” is coined
later, emphasizing real-time communication [15, 2].
By incorporating metaverse features, these platforms can
include shared virtual spaces for users to interact, virtual
concerts or events, and customizable avatars to represent
participants. This infusion of metaverse elements aims to
amplify the sense of social connectedness among music cre-
ators, fostering a shared and enjoyable experience within
the collaborative process.
This led our team to explore making a New Interface for
Musical Expression (NIME) that integrated social connect-
edness and enjoyment with a low barrier to entry for non-
musicians. W e suggest DoongDoong.club, first exhibited at
the ”Party in a Box!” exhibition held at Art Center Nabi,
Republic of Korea, 2021, as one case. 2 DoongDoong.club
works as a real-time multiplayer music sequencer as move-
ments of players and objects make one piece of music [4].
This study explores the convergence of music, technol-
ogy , and language culture to promote artistic creativity and
experimental expression. As this is a web-based collabora-
tion tool, it facilitates users to collaborate across multiple
platforms. It aims to design how components of the meta-
verse, like avatars, locomotion, and object interaction, can
enhance the immersive and engaging aspects of music cre-
ation for users. It aspires to overcome temporal and spatial
restrictions that have emerged post-pandemic through in-
novative approaches in music interface design.
2. THE DESIGN OF DOONGDOONG.CLUB
DoongDoong.club is shown inside a CR T monitor-like screen
constructed with a Perlin noise effect. On a giant pink disc,
two-dimension drawn objects are placed with players. The
giant green line, called the scanner , rotates the disc clock-
wise as the clock hand rotates. Whenever the object or the

player passes the scanner, it plays its sound. Each object
plays a recorded Korean onomatopoeic and mimetic word,
while the player makes a sine, triangle, sawtooth, or square
waveform. Music is created by moving the player or pushing
and placing the objects.
2.1 Motivation for Adopting the Y2K Graphic
Style
“Y2K”, originally a term for the computer bug that cannot
indicate the new millennium, 2000, transitioned into the
symbol of that era - from the late 1990s to the early 2000s
as the internet has explosively expanded. With the hope
of the new century , it features an optimistic future [17, 5].
This style accentuates characteristics commonly observed
in early 2000s digital design, such as highly saturated color
palettes, scan lines, gradients, realistic color loss, and dis-
tortion.
Y2K style became a trend again with the pandemic as a
reminiscence of the good past and the hope of a vigorous
future, in contrast with the dull reality [5]. The graphics of
DoongDoong.club also embraced a graphic style of the Y2K
era with a contemporary sense to alienate the space from
the real world, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

2.2 Using Korean Onomatopoeic and Mimetic
Words in DoongDoong.club
The Korean language consists of a large amount of ono-
matopoeic and mimetic words. Among about 400,000 words
in the Standard Korean Language Dictionary , more than
15000 words are inferred to be onomatopoeic and mimetic
[14]. They also play an important role in the Korean lin-
guistics. Onomatopoeic and mimetic words are native while
about 70% of words in the Korean language are loanwords
[3]. Onomatopoeic and mimetic words are thus important
in the Korean language and culture.
Another noticeable characteristic Korean onomatopoeic
and mimetic words have is their distinctive tonal and rhyth-
mic qualities. Mimetic words, a sonification of the motion,
inherit its movement as a rhythmical image. Because of
these features, onomatopoeic and mimetic words are intu-
itively understood regardless of age [1].
What will people hear When these unique tones and rhythms
are combined into a single song? Will people understand
them as a harmony of the song, or hear each component
individually? Imagine various individuals collaborating to
create compositions with these sounds –what kind of song
could be crafted? DoongDoong.club serves as a space for ex-
periencing the creation of experimental music through such
endeavors.
2.3 Emoji-Inspired Objects: Enhancing Cross-
Linguistic Communication
Figure 4: Example of Emoji-Styled Objects
Emojis possess the characteristic of low language depen-
dency , making them conceptually understandable across
various language communities [7]. W e mitigate potential re-
gional limitations caused by Korean words with emoji-style
graphic elements for users to match sounds with visuals
and recall them. The objects, thus, facilitate a straightfor-
ward understanding of sounds in diverse languages, tran-
scending regional constraints. Consequently , it promotes
effective communication between objects and users, offer-
ing functionality to overcome linguistic barriers. T able 1
refers to the exhaustive list of objects and their Korean ono-
matopoeic/mimetic words, meanings, and romanizations.
W e followed the romanization rule established by the Na-
tional Institute of Korean Language [11].
2.4 Player Character
Figure 5: Mapping of Player Shape(Platonic Solids)
- Oscillators
A non-humanoid platonic solid player character distin-
guishes itself from non-player objects to foster a sense of
detachment from the real world. This fundamental three-
dimensional shape simultaneously triggers nostalgia for early
computer graphics while existing as a complete artifact.
DoongDoong.club, where artificial objects like emojis and
platonic solids float around, paradoxically becomes a space
where everyone converges on an equal footing.
Basic waveforms, the representative of artificial sounds,
are mapped to the player’s shape. The square wave is
mapped with a cube with all faces as squares, the triangle
wave is linked to a tetrahedron with all faces as equilat-
eral triangles maintaining a triangular shape when viewed
from above. The sawtooth wave is mapped with an octa-
hedron where all faces are equilateral triangles, but when
viewed from above, it appears as a squared shape, inspired
by its waveform rising like the triangle wave but descending
like the square wave. The sine wave is linked to a regular
dodecahedron, where the shape of each face most closely
resembles a circle.
2.5 The Cul-de-Sac of The Metaverse: A Sym-
bolic Inquiry
The starry universe appears at the end of the disc to show
DoongDoong.club as one town of the internet world. The
player may proceed to move and get out of the disc, but they
will have a warning narration. If they ignore the warning
and proceed, they will be transported to different places of
the internet world as an Easter egg.
This also draws inspiration from the trend of meta-fiction
games that emerged in the early 2010s. Players move be-
yond the confines of the virtual space but with a warning
dialog. This cautionary message serves a similar purpose
as the narrator in The Stanley Parable (2013) [6], advising
players against venturing outside the prescribed boundaries
of the game [8]. The design, however, encourages critical
engagement with the system, enabling players to defy cau-
tion and explore beyond.
3. WEB DEVELOPMENT
Figure 6: Spatial Layout Diagram of Doong-
Doong.club.
W e used PlayCanvas3 , a webGL-based game engine, for
the implementation. It manages the keyboard movement,
physics engine, UI, graphics, and onomatopoeic and mimetic
word recording plays. Players’ sound is implemented with
T one.js4 for the real-time generation. T one.js is an open-
source javascript framework that works on top of W eb Audio
API to handle interactive audio on the web. The player’s
customization of waveform, pitch, and effects is rendered
through T one.js. F or onomatopoeic and mimetic words for
the non-player objects, 4 Korean people who speak Korean
as a first language recorded them in their daily speech style.
W e also used Node.js5 and socket.io. Node.js is an open-
source javascript framework for building a server. Socket.io6
is a library that establishes the communication between the
server and the client. The server is then deployed in Mi-
crosoft Azure Virtual Machine. 7 Using socket.io as a mod-
ule inside Node.js, the server handshakes with the client.
Socket.io facilitates real-time synchronization between ob-
jects, player participation status, and player locations. Upon
user connection confirmation, a socket corresponding to the
user’s ID was created and placed in the players’ array .

4. FUTURE WORK
The DoongDoong.club envisions several key directions for
future work.
First, for accessibility , we will optimize its play experi-
ence by diversifying platforms such as the mobile environ-
ment. This aims to enhance usability and facilitate easy
participation in the music and creative processes for a larger
audience.
Second, we are planning for a new feature that replaces
the sounds of existing objects through voice recording. Draw-
ing inspiration from the unique game format of Jel lyCar
W orlds (2022), where players record engine and collision
sounds with their voices to navigate cars through various
stages, voice-based customization offers new possibilities for
users to create personalized music experiences [16]. This
functionality is expected to archive onomatopoeic expres-
sions in various languages, enabling users to associate dif-
ferent languages with the same emoji.
Third, we plan to enhance the platform by adding a repli-
cation feature for sound objects, enabling users to create
more innovative and diverse musical effects through inter-
action. Currently , each object is fixed to a single instance,
but allowing users to replicate objects could boost creative
music production as users manipulate and explore sounds
within the metaverse.
Last, DoongDoong.club aims to extend its immersive ex-
perience by evolving into a three-dimensional sound instal-
lation. This will give users a sensory experience, allowing
them to perceive the directionality and location of sounds
in the installed environment.
5. CONCLUSION
DoongDoong.club presents realistic applicability in digital
design and metaverse development. Adopting familiar game
mechanics for navigation encourages user engagement, fa-
cilitating easier interaction and creative music generation
within the metaverse. This user-friendly design provides a
metaverse environment accessible to users of various ages
and experience levels.
The attempt to create music using Korean onomatopoeic
and mimetic words embraces cultural characteristics and
explores new artistic expression methods. Consequently ,
DoongDoong.club showcases unique aspects of Korean cul-
ture, allowing Korean-speaking participants to enjoy musi-
cal experiences rooted in their familiar language and cul-
tural background. Non-Korean speakers can also embrace
new musical experiences rooted in the cultural background
of Korea. Therefore, this research provides insights into
future metaverses’ design and cultural integration, antici-
pating practical usability across various fields.
