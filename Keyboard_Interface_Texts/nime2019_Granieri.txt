ABSTRACT
This paper presents Reach, a keyboard-based gesture recog-
nition system for live piano sound modulation. Reach is a
system built using the Leap Motion Orion SDK, Pure Data
and a custom C++ OSC mapper1. It provides control over
the sound modulation of an acoustic piano using the pi-
anist’s ancillary gestures.
The system was developed using an iterative design pro-
cess, incorporating research ﬁndings from two user studies
and several case studies. The results that emerged show the
potential of recognising and utilising the pianist’s existing
technique when designing keyboard-based DMIs, reducing
the requirement to learn additional techniques.

1. INTRODUCTION
Pianists spend years crafting and reﬁning their instrumental
technique. When placed in front of keyboard-based DMIs
they are often required to adapt or learn new gestural tech-
niques to operate them. For pianists, as discussed by Nicolls
[4], this turns out to be the most disruptive element of
keyboard-based DMIs: learning a new gestural language
while retaining pianistic control or freedom. Reach is a
keyboard-based DMI with a low degree of invasiveness that
utilises pre-existing technique, aiming to foster creativity
and reduce the learning curve required for formally trained
pianists at a ﬁrst encounter.
2. BACKGROUND
The ability of performers to communicate through their in-
strument depends on the ﬂuency the performer has with the
instrument itself [7] . Fluency, in this case, is seen as a com-
bination of technical proﬁciency and expressive charisma,

which in turn depend on the time spent practicing an in-
strument and ways of incorporating ancillary movements
that are known to convey expressiveness in musical perfor-
mance [6].
In recent years, a number of innovative keyboard inter-
faces have been developed that range from augmented key-
board interfaces to redesigns of the traditional keyboard
interface. The ROLI Seaboard [3] redesigns the keyboard
interface entirely by turning discrete sound activators into a
continuous controller with a touch responsive silicone slate.
The TouchKeys [5] augments an existing keyboard’s inter-
face by covering the keys with capacitive sensors.
Alongside these two commercial devices a number of pro-
totype devices exist. One such device is the system devel-
oped by Yang & Essl [9], providing the pianist with multi-
axial gesture controls over audio processing of the keyboard
sound using a combination camera based hand detection
and visual projections. Another device is the PiaF [10] that
combines machine learning with camera based technology
to recognise body gestures providing control over audio pro-
cessing parameters, noting how a pianist’s interpretation is
communicated through both the sound produced as well as
body gestures. The ancillary gestures used in this research
show potential for the intuitive control of audio processing
with movements not directly related to sound production.
Reach develops this concept further focusing entirely on an-
cillary hand gestures, as a means of manipulating sound
processing.
3. THE SYSTEM
Figure 1: Flow chart describing the Reach System
The Reach system uses a custom-made homonymous ap-
plication, written in C++ using the JUCE framework and
Leap Motion’s VR oriented Orion SDK [2], to capture hand
tracking data from the Leap Motion. The Leap Motion
is placed approximately 30cm above the piano keyboard,
where positional data is tracked by Reach, encoded and
transmitted as OSC messages. The OSC transfer protocol
has been chosen over MIDI because of its ability to trans-
mit data with a higher resolution, thus maintaining a higher
level of precision when mapping gestural data to sound mod-
375
ulation parameters. This tracking data, coming from the
joints of the ﬁngers, palms and wrists, is then received by a
Pure Data patch, where it is mapped to sound modulation
parameters.

colour coded detection areas.
The Orion SDK’s high level of precision negates the need
to de-noise the incoming data. Peak detection audio anal-
ysis was performed on the incoming piano signal in Pure
Data. When a note was struck, the positional data received
from the Leap Motion was ‘re-centred’, meaning that no
audio modulation would occur unless the hand moved away
from the current position after striking a note. If the hand
moved and a key was struck, the process repeated. This
prevented constant and erratic behaviour in the audio pro-
cessing. The Reach system has a ﬁxed set of gesture-sound
eﬀect couplings which are described in the following section.
4. GESTURES & MAPPINGS
The Reach system recognised three gestures, each mapped
to a diﬀerent audio processing parameter. These gestures
were: the lateral swaying of the hand after a key had been
pressed; the vertical movement of the hand after a key had
been pressed; and the distance of the hands from the key-
board surface.
The lateral swaying of the hand after a note had been
played was mapped to a pitch-shifting algorithm ranging
+/- 75 cents of a tone. The centre of the back of the hand
was tracked by the Leap Motion where movements to the
right raised the pitch and movements to the left lowered the
pitch.
The vertical movement of the hands when a key was de-
pressed was mapped to the ampliﬁcation of the unprocessed
piano signal. As the height of the back of the palm and
knuckles lowered, ampliﬁcation of the unprocessed signal
decreased, with ampliﬁcation increasing as the height of the
hand was raised. Perceptually, this created an eﬀect similar
to amplitude modulation.
The vertical movement of the hand away from the keys
controlled a reverb eﬀect. As the pianist moved his or her
hands vertically away from the piano, reverb was applied to
the live piano sound.
Of the three gestures recognised, the lateral swaying of
the hands had also been previously investigated in the ﬁrst
iteration of user testing [1]. From the qualitative analysis of
those interviews, the lateral swaying of the hands resulted
in being very easy for both classical and jazz pianists to
understand and embody due to the close correlation with
the gesture performed by string players to obtain a similar
eﬀect. This ancillary gesture had previously been noticed
by most of them in their own playing.
In the same interviews, pianists expressed interest in be-
ing able to modulate the intensity of the piano sound just
like string players. Taking into consideration the research
of Tits et. al. [8] regarding the correlation between eigen-
movements and expertise of the pianist, a mapping between
palm height and volume of the unprocessed audio of the pi-
ano was chosen.
The vertical movement of the hands away from the keys,
was chosen to explore an additional touch-free gesture na-
ture of the sound modulation. This gesture was discovered
and explored by a pianist which can be seen in the following
recorded performance2.
5. APPLICATION AND FUTURE WORK
To date the system has been explored by four musicians who
have all created performances with it exploring the gesture
sets provided by the system3. Moreover, in multiple user
tests the system has been explored by eighteen pianists,
ranging from classical to jazz, that provided useful insight
for the development and reﬁnement of the system.
What has emerged from this feedback is how interfaces
that exploit ancillary gestures can be successfully used by
pianists and keyboard players to intuitive manipulate audio
processing parameters at a ﬁrst encounter.
Taking this research forward, larger user studies could
be conducted further examining the tacit ﬁndings of the
research to date.
