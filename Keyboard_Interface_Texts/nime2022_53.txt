ABSTRACT
Applications for musical grid interfaces are designed without any established 
guidelines or defined design rules. However, within applications of different 
manufacturers, musicians, and designers, common patterns and conventions can be 
observed which might be developing towards unofficial standards. In this survey we 
analyzed 40 applications, instruments, or controllers and collected 18 types of 
recurring UI elements, which are clustered, described, and interactively presented in 
this survey. We further postulate 3 theses which standard UI elements should meet and 
propose novel UI elements deduced from WIMP standards.

Introduction
Musical grid interfaces are a widespread standard among music-tech industry [1][2] 
and independent musicians, artists, and developers [3][4]. This is among other things 
due to the technological freedom and flexibility which is associated with these generic, 
update-able interfaces and with the relation to the DIY movement and availability of 
parts and openness of protocols which enable to create and repurpose grids as 
individual interfaces for musical performance and practice [5][6].
As a result, user interfaces (UIs) for these interfaces are designed by a variety of 
entities with different goals, intentions, aesthetic ideas, and musical mindsets. 
However, in the absence of uniform guidelines for the design, we wondered whether 
standards have nonetheless emerged. Such standards could have developed from a 
collective memory, or from similar references. We consider such standards as 
recurring patterns of design language, even if they have not been centrally formalized 
and defined.
This paper has the purpose to investigate the following questions:
RQ1: Do standards in the design of musical grid applications exist?

RQ2: What are unconsidered options?
In the following we will present the condensed insights from our analysis of 
independent applications for the monome norns platform and from the analysis of 
commercial products. We (1) discuss recurring patterns which point to implicitly 
accepted and adapted conventions, (2) point out inconsistencies and problematic 
choices from a UI heuristic perspective, (3) present 3 theses which mitigate some of 
the to the medium-inherent limitations, and (4) present a collection of old and new UI 
elements which are adaptations of classic WIMP elements on low-res technology.
This paper presents the first overview on UI elements and UI design conventions in the 
musical grid interface context, we will use the term grid analogously to musical grid 
following the definition given by Rossmy et al. [5].
A grid Language: Hardware and Interactions
Before presenting the survey results, we first need a common language to define: (1) 
terms for the grid hardware, (2) terms for the interactions performed on grids.
Hardware
When we are referring to the grid hardware versus the visual content displayed, we 
use the term grid-interface to describe the device and application to specify the 
depicted UI. Further, with grid-buttons we are referencing the physical hardware 
buttons, not the UI elements which can depict UI buttons.
Interactions
With buttons (grid-buttons) as the central input element, all interactions with grids are 
composed of one fundamental interaction: a button click. A click consists of a "press", 
"hold" and "release" phase. Composite actions are button-click combinations of 
arbitrary complexity, which, using regular expressions, can be noted as:
click (pause, click)*
With increasing complexity of composite actions, the latency between the start and the 
end is increasing. This adds an undesired delay to the interaction flow. The total time t 
of an action can be noted as:
(1)t =t +c ( t +
i 
∑ p t )+c t ∣(t <g p t )g

where tc is the time of a click tp the time between clicks and tg the time between 
composite interactions.
Such composite interactions are known from the computer-mouse or from touch-
screens [7][8] and combinations of composite interactions such as "Hold + Click" (cf. 
computer-keyboard : "Shift") are conceivable.
Survey
In the following, we present the UI elements used in grid applications. When possible, 
we use the names of common UI elements to follow a consistent nomenclature.
Methodology
As the data basis we considered grid applications from the following resources. We 
used 30 independent user scripts from the norns community which use grids as their 
interface. We also included 10 commercial devices, which are more standardized 
interfaces as companies follow an internal design language across device generations 
and sibling products.
Table 1
We analyzed all UIs based on the used (1) UI elements, (2) interactions, and 
(3) general design strategies and usability heuristics.
Interactions
For the applications reviewed, we found that  the majority built on simple click, and 
hold and click interactions. While even more complex interactions are conceivable, we

only found: (I1) click, (I2) hold, (I3) hold and click, (I4) double click, (I5) double hold, 
and (I6) pattern click.
While I1, I2, and I3 are used in almost all instances, I4, I5, and I6 occurred 
sporadically. Typically,  I1 is the default interaction with grid content, this is activation 
of steps, toggling states, or selecting values. I2 is either used to extend the time of a 
selection (which leads to I5) or is used to trigger alternative actions. I3 is used to 
access alternative functions (cf. "Shift"), e.g. to mark selections to which values should 
be assigned, values which should be assigned, or ranges of values. I4 is used to clear 
cell data, I5 is used to show or access alternative values and functions of elements, 
and I6 is used to trigger user defined actions and can be compared to functions keys 
on the PC.
Table 2
We assume that applications will focus mainly on I1-I3, as these can be explored 
intuitively. The more complex the interactions become, the less often they are executed 
correctly or by chance during exploration.
UI Elements
Most applications draw their inspiration from the GUI context known from desktop 
computers or on smart devices123. This direct transfer includes UI elements from the

musical context and replicates therein existing graphical language (cf. piano roll, step-
sequencer, mixers).
Buttons
Almost all applications use some variations of buttons. We define buttons as UI 
elements that represent binary or discrete values (states). Their activation (state 
change) can be either momentary (as long as the button is pressed) or switching 
between states (alternating). The most simplest forms are single cell momentary 
buttons (35%), toggle buttons (40%), or cycle buttons (17.5%) (iterate multiple states). 
Multiple buttons can form logical entities such as radio buttons (50%) or value 
sequences (55%), e.g., used to program sequences.
Sliders, and Ranges
To represent continuous values, sliders are normally used. Variations are bipolar-
sliders (15%), which allow values below and above a neutral center position, polar-
sliders (20%), which allow values on one side of the spectrum, and ranges (30%) which 
determine an interval within a value range. Sliders are often used to provide explicit 
access to variables, or are implicitly part of other UI elements such as to define 
lengths or ranges. Bipolar sliders are used for octave transpose, panning, or other 
options. Further, we found a color wheel used to select color hues. Its special feature is 
that it not only enables the selection of an abstract value, but visually represents the 
value to be selected.
Keyboards, and Drum-Matrices
For dedicated note input we identified: (1) piano-style keyboards, (2) isomorphic 
keyboards, and (3) drum-matrices. Piano-style keyboards (5%) mimic the key layout of 
a piano in a skeuomorphic way [9], whereas isomorphic keyboards (30%) [10][11][12] 
reference the note layout of stringed instruments. Within an isomorphic matrix, pitch 
rises chromatically in X direction and in interval increments along the Y direction. If 
the matrix is wider than the interval increment, the same pitch can reoccur within the 
matrix. While drum-matrices (12.5%) also provide chromatic steps in X direction, they 
seamlessly advance into the next row, thus no note repetitions are included. Further, 
their layout is typically quadratic as found in samplers and drum machines. As a less 
generic concepts we identified a chord matrix which separates the root-note and chord 
type selection (OXI ONE). This simplifies the playing of more complex chords.

Pages
To structure the user interface, most applications (47.5%) use multiple pages that 
contain the user interface elements. These are logically grouped by function, focus, or 
instrument. For navigation, either external controls are used (cf. Ableton Push 2, 
Launchpad) or radio buttons for multi-page and toggle buttons for two-page 
applications within the grid. This concept mimics tab-based applications such as web 
browsers or text editors. This indicates the availability of modes and shows the 
currently active mode.
Indicators, Images, Pictograms, Glyphs, and Text
In addition, we identified UI elements that have an emphasizing rather than interactive 
character. In note sequences, e.g., not only the data but also the playback position is 
indicated. Such indicators (70%) can either iterate through the sequence, or spatially 
move within the grid. Another form of indicators are signals (10%) which are sent over 
the applications area (cf. arcologies), interacting with each other or with predefined 
objects. Further, audio data was drawn as waveforms (2.5%) to allow selection of start 
and end loop-points (cf. Deluge). This representation is restricted due to resolution, 
but can depict the rough content. To explain actions, pop-up text (5%) is used to spell 
out actions (cf. Novation Circuit). An alternative are pictograms (e.g. depiction of 
waveforms), or glyphs (e.g. basic geometric shapes) which provide a visual glue to the 
users (cf. earthsea). Such mnemonics (7.5%) can be user-defined "memory glyphs" 
which function as labels to "name" presets (cf. kria).

Design Strategies
While the previous section considered the UI elements from a conceptual standpoint, 
the following section highlights the design strategies used in the graphical 
representation of information. In the following we will illustrate the strategies on the 
example of a typical step sequencer.
Values
The most basic and common design strategy is the clear visual representation of a cell 
state. This means, for example, that two different states of a cell (empty vs. activated 
step) are indicated by two different illumination values.
Highlights
Further, selections are indicated in addition to the represented data. Thus, as long 
steps are hold the cells are highlighted and thus differentiable from empty and 
activated steps (Novation Circuit). To indicate the playback position, the indicator is 
highlighted either by inverting the color (Polyend Seq), by an increase in brightness, or 
by pulsating (Novation Circuit). The latter helps when the sequencer is not running. In 
this occasion the indicator is stationary and thus harder to identify. The pulse 
emphasizes the moving character of the playhead.
Animations
To cope with the limited resolution, color transitions between adjacent cells are used 
to display continuous values. For example, to indicate playhead positions that are finer 
than the current resolution, the upcoming position is illuminated proportionally. 
Another form of animations are transitions (Deluge or TouchGrid [13]) which create a 
spatial relationship between parts of an application. This relation can be planar, e.g. 
the horizontal arrangement of pages, or perpendicular such as zoom in and out 
transitions.
Potential Usability Issues Due to Design Decisions
Within the investigated applications we identified the following design decisions with 
the potential for usability issues. They complicate uninstructed learning, or stand in 
contrast to UI design principles [14].
First, we found UI elements that did not visually reflect a state change. For example, 
we found a single-cell toggle button used to switch between the two pages. Clicking 
the button executed the switch, but it did not changed its appearance. From a usability

heuristics perspective, this is a break with "visibility of the system status". At its core, 
this is based on two factors: (1) clear communication and (2) direct and immediate 
feedback.
Visit the web version of this article to view interactive content.
Second, we found that within some application multiple UI element types had the same 
visual appearance. While this is an issue that is exacerbated by the inherent 
limitations, it depicts a lack of "consistency and standards". In many instances, the 
design of radio buttons, sliders, and sequences is identical, even though they may 
represent different things conceptually and from a data perspective (Ansible Kria).
Visit the web version of this article to view interactive content.
Third, we observed that due to grid restrictions basic paradigms of GUI design (gestalt 
principles) are not followed. As the most apparent, missing  whitespace creates 
unintended proximity between UI elements that leads to misconceptions. Basically, the 
human eye starts to see patterns, continues, closes or interprets shapes that are not 
actually related or coherent.
Visit the web version of this article to view interactive content.
Fourth, some of the UI elements do not allow users to anticipate the associated 
interactive area. This is problematic when multiple such elements are arranged 
seamlessly on the same axis. For example, if multiple radio buttons are arranged in the 
same row and only the selected value is highlighted, users cannot easily distinguish 
whether adjacent cells belong to one element or the other.

Grid UI Element Design Postulates
Based on the previously presented observations we formulate the following three 
theses, which ideally should apply to all grid UI elements, and which we include in the 
designs of the following design collection. Thus, UI elements should be (1) visible, 
(2) separable, and (3) distinguishable.
This means that the interactive areas of the grid are marked and as a result are visible 
to the user. In concrete terms, a radio button should not only highlight the selected cell 
but also the other available options.
Further, when it is not possible to space out UI elements and by such establish a 
separation between those, the interaction with the elements should make them 
implicitly separable. This can be achieved by highlighting the whole area of the UI 
element for the duration of the interaction.
And last, the design of different UI elements should be as distinguishable as possible. 
The used visual language should help to establish clear and distinct designs which can 
be in the best case identified without interaction necessary.
Grid UI Element Design Collection
Based on the presented observations and postulates, we will present in the following a 
comprehensive listing of grid UI elements. These contain the common elements 
adapted to our postulates and further include UI elements known from the GUI world, 
which are not present in our data set.
Further, we provide interactive examples in the form of javascript mockups, to 
illustrate the fine-grained differences and existing variations.
Buttons
Button and button-based UI elements are used to represent binary or distinct values. 
The associated interactions are: momentary activation (active while hold), toggle 
behavior (inverted when clicked), and cycling behavior (iterating through a set of

or groups of check-boxes.

Sliders and Ranges
Sliders represent values in a cardinal range. They are associated with polar or bipolar 
ranges. Sliders and ranges consist of (1) thumbs, which indicate the selected values, 
and the (2) track (active and non active).
Visit the web version of this article to view interactive content.
Keys
Key are used to input notes. The values represent scales such as the western twelve 
tone scale. UI elements which are specially designed to enter, play, and select notes 
are: (1) piano-style keyboards, (2) isomorphic keyboards, and (3) drum-matrices. To 
provide orientation, piano-style and isomorphic keyboards highlight octaves, or the 
"black" or "white" keys.

Containers
Containers are used to group UI elements and to provide a way to selectively access 
these groups. Commonly such groups are structured as pages and selected via radio 
buttons (Tabs). By the authors proposed UI elements are pop-ups and accordions. 
Animated transitions are useful to emphasize the relation between the groups and the 
associated control elements.

Discussion
We started this survey with the questions if standards in the design of grid UIs exist 
and if unconsidered UI concepts from the WIMP paradigm can be identified. 
Therefore, we focussed on conventionally shaped grid interfaces [5], as opposed to 
more experimental ones [15]. We further focussed on graphical UI design and for this 
survey ignored the incorporation of velocity or other expressive modalities [16][17]. 
We found within our data set, that while many applications had a very individual focus 
and highly specialized use case and design, the majority of applications still reused and 
replicated consistent conventions.
The reoccurring UI elements are fundamentally intertwined with GUI design in general 
and depict an adaption of these WIMP concepts to a low resolution domain. While the 
underlying concepts are standardized, we found that the specific design was often 
varying and that some implementations can cause usability issues due to this 
inconsistency. We are aware that most of the examined examples are created by 
artistic minds which in the first place strive for musical mastery with their 
implementation. Thus, the musical expression is the measure such applications should 
be judged by in the first place. However, with the increasing standardization of the 
grid interface [5] the luthiers of grid applications have to face the same problems as in

musical App development [18]. This means that a complicated balance between the 
easy of use of tools and the associated musical mastery [19] has to be found.
In addition to the examined conventions in UI design we also identified that typical 
container UI elements were still unconsidered in the grid UI context. This is especially 
interesting as such struggle with available interactive area and many container 
concepts such as pop-ups or accordions work with compressed and decompressed 
space to enable access to UI elements only when required. We proposed such design in 
this paper to point out the potential, but at the same time see the challenge of offering 
immediate access to functionality which rather leads wide than deep interface 
structures.
Conclusion
This survey has shown that UI conventions in grid interfaces exist, and as a 
consequence we have tried to formalize some of these standards and the design ideas 
they contain. Although such UI designs are highly dependent on the application 
context, we hope that this collection can at least be inspirational and highlight some 
design principles that could improve the usability of grid UIs. We hope to stimulate a 
discussion within the NIME community about UI design standards as they exist in the 
GUI world. We see this paper as a starting point for defining such conventions, which 
need to be progressively refined and considered from multiple perspectives.
Ethics Statement
Within the survey only publicly available resources were used. The data that was 
collected was handled according to the requirements of the German Data Protection 
Act and stored anonymously.
