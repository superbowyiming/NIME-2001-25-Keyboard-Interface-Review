Code LiveCode Live, or livecode embodied 
Marije A.J. Baalman  
The concept of this livecoding performanc e is to only use the sound of the typing 
on the keyboard of the lapt op as the source material for the audio in the 
performance. Furthermore, the sensi ng devices embedded in the laptop (e.g. 
accelerometers, touchpad, trackpoin t, camera, the keyboard) are made 
accessible and mapped (through livecoding) to the manipulatio n of the sound 
material. Also the processes of the code itself (e.g. their memory and cpu usage) 
are used as sensors and used in the perfo rmance. As such the performance of 
livecoding is influenced through its own si de effects, transforming the code not 
only in the common logical, programma tical manner, but as an embodied 
interface of the machine on our lap.
