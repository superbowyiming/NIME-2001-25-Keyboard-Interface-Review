Abstract
Timbre, pitch, and timing are often relevant in digital musical
instrument (DMI) design. Amongst the three, timbre is the most
difficult to define and discretise when negotiating audio repre-
sentations and gesture-sound mappings. We conduct a corpus-
assisted discourse analysis of “timbre” in all NIME proceedings
to date (2001–2024). Combining this with a detailed review of 18
timbre-focused papers, we examine how definitions of timbre and
timbre interaction methods are constructed through, for instance,
Wessel’s numerical timbre control space, synthesis tools and pro-
gramming languages, machine learning and AI approaches, and
other trends in digital lutherie practices. While acknowledging
the practical utility of technical constructions of timbre in NIME
(and other digital music research communities), we contribute
discussion on the entanglement of technology and aesthetics in
instrument design, which constitutes what “timbre” becomes in
NIME research, and reflect on the tension between technosci-
entific and constructivist understandings of timbre: how DMIs
and musical practices have been reconstituted around particular
timbral values operationalised in NIME. In response, we propose
ways that the community can embrace more critical approaches
and awareness to how our methods and tools shape and co-create
our notions of timbre, as well as other musical concepts, connect-
ing more openly with diverse types of sonic phenomena.

1 Introduction
Timbre matters in musical practice but is difficult to work with. It
has been called a sonic “wastebasket, ” full of what remains beyond
pitch, loudness and timing when we experience musical sound
[90]. Compared to these aspects, timbre can be defined in many
ways; for example, the “quality” or “colour” of a sound (aesthet-
ics), an instrument’s identity (perception), individual performers’
characteristics (articulation), frequency distribution (acoustics),
and vocal formants (physiology). When creating digital musi-
cal instruments or interfaces (DMIs), the designer is required
to manipulate digital technology as an additional medium for
crafting sonic material and interactions [66]. The International
Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)
and related communities of digital lutherie and sonic creativity
have researched or engaged with timbre in the pursuit for new
sounds and musical experiences. However, timbre’s ambiguity
brings the question of how “successful” DMI designers have been
at designing with and for timbre.
We examine timbre in NIME research to better understand
how its different views and conceptualisations have been enacted
in DMI design and, as a result, musical practices. We analyse pre-
vious NIME proceedings (2001–2024) through a corpus-assisted
discourse analysis of “timbre. ” Parts of the analysis draw com-
parisons with past proceedings of the International Computer
Music Conference (ICMC 1975–2024), one of the main pre-NIME
(before 2001) and off-NIME (since 2001) venues for disseminating
research on the use of computers in music [89]. We further review
a subcorpus of 18 NIME papers that specifically denote timbre
in their titles to understand timbre’s associations, the tools and
parameters used to interact with timbre, and some of the timbre
goals in the NIME community.
This analysis exhibits two main findings about timbre and
NIME. First, the community has focused largely on control: there
is no clear aesthetical approach to timbre; however, NIME has
very specific ways to work with and manipulate timbre in musical
interaction (cf. [24]). These methods originate from technosci-
entific viewpoints and values originating in music information
retrieval (MIR), psychoacoustics, and digital systems research
that have codified timbre’s ambiguity into particular features [57].
These features have come to act as proxies for timbre and its per-
ceptual experience. Second, the way that NIME operationalises
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Saitis et al.
timbre is entangled with musical practices, aesthetics, and digi-
tal tools. This reflects epistemological and methodological ten-
sions between musicology-sound-timbre studies and perception-
technology-research [58]; for example, between manipulating
timbre and what Fales [27] calls “perceptualising” timbre.
Through reflection on timbre within the NIME corpus, we
here examine how timbre has been constructed within the NIME
community and digital musical interaction more broadly. We offer
three main considerations for the community and its relationship
with timbre. Examining and potentially challenging the way we
conceptualise timbre, we suggest some avenues for DMI designers
to pursue novel dimensions of timbre interaction:
(1) We unpack the NIME corpus to understand influences in
timbre’s use in our community. We identify the influence of
conceptual timbre frameworks, links to MIR research trends,
and tools used in designing with/for timbre.
(2) We discuss how timbre thinking is entangled with design
thinking and how timbre has been codified through the in-
fluence of technological practices. We suggest how NIME
research is at risk of being both reductive and vague about
timbre, trapped in technology advancements that see timbre
reified as a handful of extractable features.
(3) We provide six points of tension between timbre ideologies
as new avenues for research at NIME and beyond (music
psychology, sound studies, MIR). We discuss whether timbre
is an object or property to be treated by mapping, or some-
thing that emerges from mappings and the behaviour they
engender. We suggest future work to expand our ideas of
what timbre is and what we can do with it.
2 Conversation Starters
2.1 Timbre Defined, Timbre Ambiguous
The concept of timbre emerged as a distinct musical parameter
during the 18th century, initially described through metaphorical
language that emphasized its ineffable qualities. Early theorists,
particularly Rousseau in his 1768 Dictionnaire de musique [69],
characterised timbre as the distinctive “colour” or “quality” of
a sound that distinguished one instrument from another, even
when playing the same pitch at the same volume. Almost two cen-
turies later, the American National Standards Institute’s (ANSI)
formal 1960/1994 definition of timbre described it as encompass-
ing all perceptual attributes of sound other than pitch, loudness,
and duration [3]. This definition-by-negation, while precise in
what it excludes, reflects the historical challenge of positively
defining what timbre is (cf. [78]).
The challenge of defining timbre extends beyond mere techni-
cal description into fundamental questions about musical aesthet-
ics and sonic creativity. Barrière [8] positions timbre as a critical
point of aesthetical and philosophical divergence—“an inevitable
breaking-point”—in musical discourse, where different conceptu-
alisations of timbre represent opposed musical worldviews and
aesthetical positions. Chion [ 16] has gone so far as to call for
the dissolution of timbre (timbre survived this attack). While the
ANSI definition provided a formal framework, the challenges of
meaningfully negotiating and working with timbre persist, par-
ticularly in the contexts of electroacoustic music [80], computer
music [22], and digital instrument design [71] where technology
and aesthetics are entangled. Specifically concerning NIME, the
problem that timbre is ambiguous and underspecified might also
be symptomatic of a difficulty of talking about musical aesthetics.
It is much easier to talk about control structures, after all.

2.2 Timbre Described, Timbre Prescribed
Technology has been central in the formation of timbre per-
ception as a research field. Computational methods for multidi-
mensional scaling developed in the 1960s enabled researchers
to consolidate responses from listening tests into spatial repre-
sentations which they could also visualise (e.g., the timbre of the
English horn “being closer” to that of the bassoon than that of
the trumpet when the three instruments are played at the same
pitch and dynamic) [41]. Advances in digital signal processing
and sound synthesis around the same time [68] made it possible
to link spectral, temporal, and energy features of recorded or
synthesized audio signals with the dimensions of what came to
be known as “timbre space” (see [54] for a review). Since then,
the timbre space model and metaphor has dominated scientific
discourse on timbre [79]. It has also been built into new technolo-
gies for music creation and performance as well as into audio
classification schemes and formatting standards like MPEG-7,
which support the design of DMIs and music software applica-
tions [49, 57, 60].
One of the first attempts to instrumentalise timbre space
was by Wessel [ 91]. He was interested in how its descriptive
(cor)relations between audio features and listeners’ perceived
timbre similarity might be turned into a prescriptive and inter-
active “musical control structure” that would allow musicians
to measure, navigate, and create new timbres. Mapping real-
time gestures to timbre in high-dimensional control spaces has
since been a major staple of computer music and instrument de-
sign research [88], including more recently “latent timbre spaces”
learned by generative artificial intelligence (AI) models for audio
synthesis [28, 56, 62, 77]. Other approaches include generating
musical materials directly from timbre space [74], or else using
timbre space to condition generative AI models [26].
2.3 Timbre Represented, Timbre Entangled
In investigating the usages and possible definitions of the word
timbre, we highlight but neither endorse nor reject the represen-
tationalism widely found in the sciences: “the power of words
to mirror preexisting phenomena” [7]. Representationalism un-
derpins the common assumption that there already exists in the
world some property of sound (whether physical or perceptual)
that we might control or manipulate, and that the word “tim-
bre” (and/or a set of numeric descriptors) act as pointers to that
property. Numerical timbre space models [54] and semantic de-
scriptors [73] are just two of many possible representations that
are proposed to stand in for that ideal underlying property.
Alternatively, relational ontologies such as Barad’s agential re-
alism [7] consider timbre (and any other concept) to be a “specific
(De)Constructing Timbre at NIME NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia
material configuration”, not something preordained at all, but
enacted through designing, performing, listening, and other acts
of musicking. If we follow that line of thought, we could propose
that the instrument doesn’t manipulate timbre as some inde-
pendent, well-defined entity, nor even have timbre as a context-
independent property, so much as the instrument is timbre; or
rather, “timbre” acquires its meaning in relation to the specific
phenomenon (in Barad’s sense of the term) encompassing the
relationships between physical materials, code, player, listener,
musical context, etc. The implication would be that we should
not go chasing universals about what a term could mean for
a community overall, but rather should attend to specificities
and effects of difference across practices, a point aligned with re-
cent critical discourse in NIME and the broader human-computer
interaction (HCI) community [50, 67, 83, 97].
3 When NIME Talks Timbre
We considered the entire collection of NIME proceedings from
2001 to date, which are freely available for download in PDF for-
mat from the conference’s permanent website.1 The total number
of papers listed on the NIME website is 2,204. For some years,
these include keynote talks and music or installation submissions,
which we opted to omit from analysis. PDF files were converted
to plain text using the python library PyMuPDF. Any text before
the first heading (usually Introduction), including the Title and
Abstract, was discarded, as were headers and any References or
Acknowledgments sections. Thirty PDF documents could not be
parsed, leaving a total of 2,132 text files to be analysed, or a lexical
corpus of 7M tokens (6,870,080). Corpus-assisted discourse analy-
sis [1] was conducted using LancsBox2 [12] and Sketch Engine3
[46], as well as manual keyword search.
3.1 Keyness
A keyword is a word that is statistically more frequent in a “focus”
corpus in comparison to another, typically much larger “refer-
ence” corpus [6]. We first performed a keyness analysis of the
terms “timbre, ” “pitch, ” “gesture, ” “mapping, ” and “music” to es-
tablish how distinctive the NIME bibliography (focus corpus) is
in terms of the frequency of occurrence of these words.
“Music” was used as a control term; in keyword search (see
next section), we expected it to show up in all of the papers [44].
Pitch has long been favoured over timbre in music scholarship
(though this is changing [25]), which often informs research prac-
tices in digital instrument design, music informatics, and machine
listening. Therefore, we expected “pitch” to occur more frequently
than“timbre” in the two corpora. This is indeed what we observed.
Finally, “gesture” and “mapping” are two key concepts in DMI
design that are similarly difficult to negotiate, their existence be-
ing lodged between technical-physical and metaphorical-musical
definitions and tensions [44, 56]. This is not to suggest that pitch
is a well-defined musical concept that resists epistemological
and methodological tension—think of tuning [75] and noise [21],
for example—and even “music” itself is constantly negotiated
across disciplines [92] and cultures [86]. While our focal point is
timbre, its ambiguity connects to a broader pattern of technology
and aesthetic entanglements in music and HCI [58], including
timing/rhythm [19] and genre [37].

As reference, we considered a corpus of 40k (40,001) open
access (OA) CC-BY articles from across Elsevier’s journals.4 Key-
ness was evaluated using the log-likelihood (𝐺2) test, compar-
ing the observed versus expected frequencies of each of the five
terms above in the NIME and Elsevier corpora to a𝜒2 distribution
with one degree of freedom. Frequency counts included plurals
(e.g., “timbres”) and other variations (e.g, “timbral”, “timbrally”;
“remapping”); for NIME, counts were obtained from LancsBox,
while Sketch Engine was used for Elsevier. The 𝐺2 threshold for
keyness is typically 15.13 for 𝑝 < .0001 [64], hence the values
reported in Figure 1 are significant by orders of magnitude. We
can see that “timbre” is key in NIME, but its keyness is the lowest
among the tested terms.
3.2 Keyword Occurrence
We then searched through each year of NIME to return the num-
ber of papers containing the five terms above (i) generally in
the main body text (i.e., excluding titles) and (ii) explicitly in
the title (only the first four terms). For comparison purposes, we
also searched for the same terms in the ICMC proceedings as
a community more interested in aesthetics of computer music,
with NIME more interested in instrument design and HCI. ICMC
proceedings since 1975 are freely available (except for 1976, 1979,
and 2020) but less straightforwardly downloadable. However, it
is possible to manually perform keyword search online.5

all but the control terms are presented in Table 2 (body text only
and title only). In NIME there are some, but very few (2%), papers
that do not contain the word “music, ”. “Gesture” is the most
commonly occurring of the terms, after “music, ” in agreement
with previous literature [ 44]. “Timbre” is the least frequently
occurring of the terms, used on average in 37% of all papers, with
some fluctuations from year to year. On average, “pitch” as a
keyword appears about 1.6x more often than “timbre” and at
similar levels with “gesture” and “mapping. ”
In contrast, the most frequent term in ICMC is “pitch, ” appear-
ing about 1.5x more often than “timbre, ” which in this corpus is
used between 1.14x (2001–2024) and 1.4x (1975–2024) more than
“gesture” and “mapping. ” This was to be expected, as ICMC is less
focused on instruments and interaction than NIME. The distri-
bution of “mapping” generally follows that of “gesture” across
both corpora. When narrowing down the search by paper titles
only, “timbre” comes up about as frequently as “pitch” in NIME
(0.84% versus 0.94%). At ICMC 2001–2024 the trend is similar
but reversed (1.77% versus 1.59%) and overall “timbre” appears at
least twice more often than in NIME. When considering the full
ICMC corpus, timbre is even more frequently used than pitch
(1.95% versus 1.40%), at similar levels with gesture, and almost
2x more often used than mapping.
The fact that there are almost twice as many papers mention-
ing “pitch” than there are containing “timbre” in both NIME and
ICMC corpora could appear to reflect what Diduck [ 23] calls
claviocentrism—that current musical interaction design practices
encode assumptions about musical space that are primarily based
on the analytical idea that music is made by discrete onset and
release events. This further connects [ 58] to the hegemony of
keyboard paradigms of interaction in NIME (and ICMC as well
as in commercial practice), moreover encapsulated in the MIDI
(Musical Instrument Digital Interface) protocol. Puckette [63] has
disclosed that the early work behind the Pd and Max software
packages was inspired by the “piano metaphor... a collection of
tasks running in parallel”, whose timing is controlled by “wait
functions and triggers. ”
3.3 Full Corpus Collocations
To get a sense of what conceptions, definitions, and tools NIME
authors usually associate with timbre, we continued with analy-
ses of collocation (complete NIME corpus) and concordance (fo-
cused subcorpus, see below). To identify collocates (terms appear-
ing together with the keyword), we looked for co-occurrences
within five words to the left of “timbre” and five to the right, thus
identifying looser word associations than multiword expression
approaches, such as n-grams or word clusters [1].
Collocates were initially determined by the logDice statistic
in Lancsbox. logDice is a standardised measure for identifying
co-occurrence. It expresses the typicality (or strength) of the
collocation rather than its frequency, and operates on a scale with
a fixed maximum value of 14, which makes it directly comparable
across different corpora [33]. Comparing two scores, +1 point
indicates twice as often collocation. Setting a minimum logDice
value of 6 and a minimum collocation frequency of 1, a list of
444 collocates was initially obtained. These were then filtered
manually to remove generic or irrelevant terms (e.g., prepositions,
plurals, variations, synonyms).
Table 3 lists 72 collocates alongside their logDice statistic, co-
occurrence frequency (Freq.), and distribution of textual position
around “timbre, ” ranging from -1 (five words to the left) to +1
(five words to the right). We find several interesting observations:
•Timbre is referred to as a (multi)dimensional space and by its
many facets (acoustic, perceptual, semantic, musical, sonic);
•Space is a key conceptual metaphor at the crossroads of tim-
bre understanding (representation, description) and timbre
interaction (control, mapping);
•Technical descriptors from psychoacoustics and music tech-
nology (e.g., frequency, similarity, brightness, synthesiser, pa-
rameters, features)—in Section 4.1.1, we identify a risk in NIME
practices for parameters and features to become (technical)
proxies for timbre;
•Musical-aesthetical descriptors referring to performative and
artistic practice (e.g., tone, noise, texture, samples, soundscape,
vibrato, morphing), which may also act as (aesthetical) proxies
for timbre [29, 70, 80];
•Words related to timbre (space) control or exploration, through
gesture and (re)mapping, and the design of expressive instru-
ments with a range of timbral nuances and possibilities;
•Descriptors of “identity, ” of pursuing adifferent and original
sound—van Elferen [87, p. 72] notes that “timbral difference
is a crucial factor in musical individuation and identity” and
Gooley [35] demonstrates a case of timbral difference as black
identity in the adoption of specific pedalling techniques by
African-American jazz pianists;
•Terms that diverge from views of timbre as something static
or categorical (dynamic, temporal, continuous).
3.4 Focused Subcorpus Concordances
Keyword and collocate findings provide a high-level understand-
ing of trends in corpora. Moving towards an in-depth under-
standing of timbre’s use and conceptualisation in NIME, we next
focused on a subcorpus of 18 papers (59,364 tokens) where “tim-
bre” (also “timbres” and “timbral”) is explicitly used in the title.
Using LancsBox, a total of 587 concordances were found, listing
all found examples of timbre within corresponding textual con-
texts spanning 10 words to the left and 10 to the right. Findings
are detailed in Table 4 and summarised below.

Half of the papers explicitly adopt feature extraction meth-
ods (e.g., spectral centroid, Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients
or MFCCs) to work with timbre through audio representations
popular with the MIR and audio signal processing communities
[31, 36, 43, 45, 47, 61, 77, 82, 95]. Several papers (six out of 18, or
33.3%) focused on timbre synthesis and control through verbal
attributes [45, 47, 48, 82, 84] or notation of spoken/sung vocables
[55]. Soraghan et al. [82] explicitly designed a control interface
based on the “luminance-texture-mass” semantic model of timbre
proposed by Zacharakis et al. [96]. Lam and Saitis’s [48] timbre
synthesiser instrumentalises the psychoacoustical timbre space
model (see Section 2). Moving from controlling pre-labelled pa-
rameters (whether signal- or word-based), timbre interaction in
more recent works involves learned features and latent space
manipulation, reflecting current advances in deep learning and
AI technology [39, 40, 77].
Most of the papers (12 out of 18 or 66.6%) make no reference
to what timbre is or might be, rather focusing on the control of
relevant parameters from related work. Those that do attempt to
describe what timbre is acknowledge the difficulty of the task:
Shier et al. [ 77] open their paper reflecting that “Timbre is a
musical concept that has distinctly resisted precise definition in
psychoacoustics and music psychology research. ” Elsewhere, tim-
bre is outlined via its function as a critical aspect of expression
[43, 47, 77] and beneficial for the development of instrumental
or sonic skills [48, 61, 81]. We find a single paper where timbre
explicitly “had priority over pitch” in the design of an electroa-
coustic instrument [32]. The authors note that “the objects that
do not have clear pitched sonority are the most musically in-
teresting. This is because they allow for experimentation with
more complex timbral and textural nuances. ” (p. 290, emphasis
in original).
4 Implications/Contributions
4.1 Assumptions and Risks
The findings from the corpus-assisted discourse analysis demon-
strate the entanglement between timbre and available technology
and trends in MIR research at NIME. Although most of the 18 sub-
corpus papers do not directly define it, the framing and nature of
timbre is tied to the method or technique used to examine it. Our
working definitions of and interaction with timbre is therefore a
result of the tools and approaches we have at our disposal. The
availability of techniques to extract particular facets of timbre
from audio signals (e.g., MFCCs) give cause to utilise and asso-
ciate them with what timbre is for us and our musical practices.
As a result, our understanding of timbre is tied to technoscientific
achievements, a proper sociotechnical construction [51].
This use of particular views of timbre is not inherently prob-
lematic but can become so when these features assume the whole
of timbre. As well, when the available technology changes, our
conceptualisation changes. For example, the recent rapid pro-
liferation of deep neural networks as audio synthesisers has
remobilised our conceptualisation of and interaction with tim-
bre to move away from feature extraction towards implicitly
learned latent spaces that defy conceptual explanation. To that
end, the scientific approach is intolerant of multiple truths about
what timbre is and how it can be operationalised in DMI design.
The scientific principle that, sooner or later, we will get to a
concrete understanding of timbre through small advancements
comes into contrast with artistic and creative ideals, through
which there are many paths and no “correct” way through. This
tension between technoscientific solutionism and phenomeno-
logical and constructivist approaches is present in broader HCI
as well [56, 65]. Working to further advance control over timbre,
as opposed to asking broader questions about context, creativity,
and exploration, poses a risk of diluting timbre down to a handful

of features and extraction methods. Without consideration, re-
search at NIME and related fields can treat abstract concepts such
as timbre (and pitch, rhythm, and even music itself) as problems
to be resolved, as opposed to exploring their entanglement with
and construction via sociocultural valuation.
4.1.1 Features as Proxies. Within the 18-paper subcorpus, it is
clear that there is no one way that timbre is defined. Authors
make associations to frequency, spectra, filters, modulations and
other technical features of or operations on audio signals. Full
corpus collocations indicate similar timbre associations. Selected
features then become a way to work with timbre and are depen-
dent on the technology being used and the relevant instrumen-
tation and pedagogies in which the interaction is grounded. For
example, Pond et al. [61] quantify tone quality in cello playing
via the harmonic centroid of a note, a feature motivated by the
authors in prior work by Charles [15] and Hermes et al. [42]. It
is worthwhile to note that Charles identified features for violin
timbre analysis, and the findings of Hermes et al. were based on
listening rather than playing. The feature of harmonic centroid,
while practically useful, is applied in such a way that it stands
in for timbre, when in actuality it merely reflects a particular
nuance of a larger conceptual space.
Pond et al. outline the origins of their chosen feature, which
provides a necessary context for their system, as do Graham et
al. [36] with Bark-frequency spectral features’ relationship to
guitar technique, and Hsu [43] with respect to communicative
priorities in saxophone improvisation. We can observe how audio
features such as these become a proxy for timbre as a whole.
Without centering the chosen timbre proxies in previous research,
particular tools and approaches (even down to the distinctions of
violin and cello bowing technique) risk becoming timbre. Then,
they may be used to objectively evaluate, say, performance as
“good” or “bad” without consideration of the bias or constructed
values through which these proxies originate. Such paradigms
already exist in other HCI contexts, leading to data being taken
out of context and potentially reducing human experience down
to a handful of relatively arbitrary dimensions [17, 65].
4.1.2 Operationalising Features (or Not). If particular features
have become a proxy for timbre, then it is important to reflect
on how these features have come to be used. That NIME prac-
tices are inherently linked with trends in MIR research is logical:
toolboxes for audio feature extraction from the late 2000s and
early 2010s (e.g., [10, 49, 60]) make it simple to decompose timbre
into distinguishable, readily controllable features. Today, deep
learning and AI methods have greatly expanded the set of timbre
generation and control tools that are possible, including some
that would be unimaginable or infeasible with traditional audio
signal processing techniques, such as replacing the timbre of
one sound (e.g., a person singing) in an existing audio recording
with that of another (e.g., a violin) while preserving pitch and
dynamics, an approach known as “timbre transfer” [14, 77].
Feature extraction, timbre transfer and other machine listening
techniques augment human listening and therefore our relation-
ship to an instrument or timbre constructed with these methods.
In this way, artefacts like aliasing [14] might become real aspects
of a reified timbre because they are tied to an algorithm, rather
than to human perception. In this sense, MIR research and DMI
design both involve an analytical premise that timbre was always
there and the current goal is to “extract” what it is and use it.
When we define timbre in terms of these readily available techni-
cal representations, they become the point of interaction: timbre
description is prescription, and DMIs and musical practice recon-
stitute themselves around what this operationalised definition
of timbre is. This approach entangles the aesthetic valuation of
commercial and solutionist approaches in DMI design, wherein
accessible, easy-to-implement values are prioritised [59]. Con-
versely, there is less space for individual, subjective valuation of
timbre and aesthetic consideration of the messy, emotional, and
complex relationship we have with sound.
Our research practices fit into this valuation: having done
so repeatedly through subsequent research, other experiences
and previous knowledges are rewritten as a result of a particu-
lar approach—consider Pond et al. ’s work (Section 4.1.1), where
cello timbre is evaluated using a feature-as-proxy derived from
findings in different contexts. Our timbre thinking is redefined
by our design thinking —the solutions we come up with [59]. As
Magnusson [53] describes, this premise operates as a “migration”
of musical instruments around sociotechnical conditions. The
evolution of particular valuations of what matters in musical
expression are transported from one context to another. In NIME,
timbre and our working definitions of it become embedded in
this migration process; our research carries forward a valuation
of certain approaches to understanding and manipulating timbre
and instructs others, including the musicians using the tools we
design, that they should value these approaches as well.
4.2 Six Points of Tension and Future Work
NIME is suspended in this tension between technoscientific and
constructivist approaches to timbre. We must decide what notion
of timbre we constructed based on the tools we use and create.
First, we must acknowledge that the NIME community’s con-
ceptualisation of timbre is a construction of the digital age [57]
and an entanglement of human and computer. The tools we use
and create are part of the reification of timbre. Second, to exam-
ine this construction is not to suggest that instrument designers
should abandon current approaches to timbre, or that alternative
technologies could achieve timbre neutrality [ 51]. Instead, we
might embrace and even emphasise the unresolved contradic-
tions embedded in our tools, acknowledging their influence on
the design of new timbral and musical artefacts.
In our analysis, we have identified six such contradictions as
points of epistemological and methodological tension—paradoxes
of timbre as famously outlined by Fales [27] and van Elferen [87]:
(1) Static vs. dynamic – Timbre can refer to fixed, objective
features of sound, or timbre can be nuanced as an emergent prop-
erty of human-computer interaction. Contemplating the timbral
agency of piano pedaling in African-American jazz aesthetics
(see Section 3.3), Gooley [35, p. 121] articulates that instrumental
timbres “are the products of an encounter between a person and
a technology” (see also [72]).
(2) Categorical vs. continuous – Categorical timbre arises from
traditional music research (violin vs. trumpet) and language
(“bright, ” “breathy, ” “airy”) as well as the digital synthesis era
(MIDI protocol, synthesiser presets). Acoustics and our musical
experience recognise infinite gradations between these categories.
Digital tools simultaneously reinforce both perspectives—offering
categorical presets while also providing continuous control.
(3) Controlled vs. explored – While DMI design places central
importance on interacting with timbre as something that can be
controlled, manipulated, mapped, and transferred, it also “works
directly contrary to the efforts of perceptualisation” [27, p. 66]
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Saitis et al.
necessary to support timbre as something to be explored, for
example, through utilising ambiguity over labelled features [65].
(4) Identity vs. features – Perceptually, we can understand the
timbral difference between a violin tone and a cello tone based
on context and experience (cf. [ 35, 87]). Timbre might also be
portioned into explicit features as representations, which may
act as a proxy for timbre altogether, for example, a “cello tone” is
ascribed to particular harmonic partials [61]).
(5) Ascribed vs. generated – Timbre can be treated as something
ascribed through listening and context. Feature extraction and
timbre transfer (and generative AI more broadly) approaches
ascribe timbre qualities to an existing signal. Timbre can also
be viewed as something generated through measurable physical
properties, as in physical modelling synthesis approaches [81].
When we construct representations and analytical spaces which
also generate timbre (e.g., Wessel’s numerical timbre control
space [91]), we force the ascribing and generating perspectives
to be the same thing when they are not.
(6) Perceived by humans vs. by machines – Humans use
abstract representations and metaphorical language to concep-
tualise timbre, for instance calling a sound “bright, ” “breathy, ”
“airy. ” Such descriptors are neither uniform nor easily defined;
rather, digital systems mean that designers constantly negotiate
between what is useful for machine processes and what is per-
ceptible or meaningful to humans [5, 37, 76, 92].
This is a non-exhaustive and of course non-orthogonal list of
contradictions-paradoxes in the way timbre is used and under-
stood in DMI design. The NIME community can further explore
how particular aspects of each tension might be encoded in our
tools and practices and what they instruct users—musicians, audi-
ences, scholars, scientists, engineers—to value. We suggest NIME
to utilise these paradoxes and explore timbre through personal,
situated, and entangled knowledge [2]. Within the NIME commu-
nity’s focus not on defining timbre but on control, manipulation,
mapping, and transfer, there is potential to be open to other as-
pects and novel forms of timbre and timbre interaction. We argue
that, if unpacked (but not necessarily resolved), these contradic-
tions could be rather generative for both instrument design and
timbre research.
Reflecting on our view of timbre as a site of epistemologi-
cal and methodological tension between technoscientific and
constructivist approaches, we ask DMI designers to consider: If
timbre is a “thing” that exists, then what form does it exist in? A
numerical dimension space? Is it categorical or continuous? Is it
something ascribed or generated? and so on. Given the six points
of tension outlined above, it is clear that this question is diffi-
cult to answer in any generalisable way, and we suggest that
maybe timbre is not a “thing” to begin with, but a term that has
been used itself as a proxy to the massive, ambiguous contexts
that comprise sound and our experience of it. Thinking back
to NIME’s conceptualisation of timbre as a construction of the
digital era [57], we may provoke a little further:What is left when
we remove the digital? Does “timbre” survive in these forms?
An invitation to challenge and expand current notions of tim-
bre might extend beyond the two main tendencies of techno-
science and constructivism. In resonance with the metaphor of
“timbre space” we draw an analogy from geography: the distinc-
tion between space (a property of the natural world, a location
describable by coordinates) and place (which carries meaning,
personality, or connections to cultural or personal identity). This
could lead us to begin exploring alternative ways of conceptual-
izing and using timbre—such as in relation to personal emotional
states, memories, shared identities, or cultural contexts [34]. Fur-
ther methodologies or frameworks for interacting with social
entanglements may then emerge.
We also aim to revisit the NIME corpus, including a more sys-
tematic analysis of ICMC and other pre- and off-NIME sources, to
extract more nuanced information on digital music communities
and timbre-based practice, and expanding it on other relevant
literature (e.g., Computer Music Journal, Organised Sound, In-
ternational Society for Music Information Retrieval) and also
on non-academic sources (e.g., online communities about mod-
ular synthesisers, digital electronics). Doing so might elicit a
better understanding of how DMI communities construct micro-
conceptualisations of timbre based on community interest, com-
munication, and collaboration [9].
Furthermore, as one anonymous reviewer of this work sug-
gested, analysing how timbre discourse has shifted over time
within NIME and ICMC (and related communities and sources)
would provide valuable insights into the changing epistemologies
of digital music research [52]. Such as the shifting interest from
controlling features extracted from audio signals to manipulating
latent spaces of neural networks learned from audio signals men-
tioned earlier, other trends and influences will have shaped the
nuanced conceptualisation of timbre. Understanding these shifts
over time can provide insight or even predictions about future
shifts that will inevitably emerge with innovation in the digital
and AI space.
