ABSTRACT
Distributed music as a performance practice has seen signif-
icant growth over the past decade. This paper surveys the
development of the genre, documenting important prece-
dents, peripheral inﬂuences, and core works. We addition-
ally discuss common modes of implementation in the genre
and contrast these approaches and their motivations.

1. INTRODUCTION
” Announcers at every modern-day concert com-
mand us to turn oﬀ our cell phones, but what
Cagean aesthetic possibilities might we discover
in leaving them on?”
So rings Golan Levin in the artist’s statement for Dial-
tones: A Telesymphony (2001) [11], a foundational compo-
sition in the emerging genre of distributed music: music
that performs an audience’s electronic devices as a uniﬁed
instrument or invites their participation as an impromptu
electronic ensemble. This is a question that he and others
have begun to answer through dozens of performances and
compositions worldwide, in a variety of modes and models,
but all originating from a common condition: the average
concert hall now contains hundreds of latent speakers, re-
siding in the pockets of virtually every audience member.
Yet this performance genre lacks a collected history; most
existing overviews list only a few works, and do not give a
comprehensive image of the emergence of the genre. While
mobile, networked, and social computing have deﬁned the
last decade, the history of this genre precedes the smart-
phone, with roots stretching back over 40 years. In this
survey, we look closely at two foundational works in the

genre—Jose Maceda’s Ugnayan (1974) and Golan Levin et
al’s Dialtones: A Telesymphony (2001)—and additionally
document over a dozen performances which contributed to
the genre between 1990 and 2016.
1.1 Ingredients for a Genre
The projection of music from within an audience can be
found in many traditional formats, such as the church in
which the whole audience sings, or the drum circle in which
every listener participates. The current refocusing on au-
dience involvement occurs at the conﬂuence of several 20th
century developments: electronic broadcast technologies pro-
vide new modes of distributing sound; and multichannel
speaker arrays have established a paradigm for placing many
individual electronic sound sources around an audience. A
further contribution comes from the rise of participatory
art as a genre in the 1950s and 1960s, when artists such
as Allan Kaprow and Fluxus integrated the audience into
their Happenings. By distributing performance instructions
to the audience and considering them participatory agents,
Fluxus and other artists established a framework through
which an audience can help generate an artwork. As part
of this movement, Laurie Anderson created an early exam-
ple of a distributed sonic artwork when she performed Car
Horn Symphony (1969), conducting an audience at a drive-
in theater in New Hampshire to sound their car horns in a
collaborative concert.
2. FOUNDATIONS: UGNAYAN
Filipino professor Jose Maceda’s (1917-2004) acoustic and
electronic works for masses of participants oﬀer perhaps the
most substantial framework for distributed music perfor-
mance, a framework which has been replicated by many con-
temporary composers. Among his masterpieces, Ugnayan
(1974), for a mass of participants with individual radio re-
ceivers, may be his most inﬂuential work. Broadcast on all
37 active radio frequencies in the city of Manila, the work
encouraged residents of the city to take their radios out into
the streets and turn them up, in order to create a collabo-
rative sound collage across the city. Promoted as part of a
government agenda to demonstrate the unity of the coun-
try, the work also holds a complicated relationship with the
political environment of its era.
2.0.1 The Landscape Maceda Inherits: Creative Ra-
diophony in the 1950s-70s
Repurposing handheld radio receivers as instruments was
becoming common in the years preceding Ugnayan. John
Cage’s compositions Imaginary Landscape No. 4 (1951),
Speech (1955), and Radio Music (1956) were composed for
ensembles of radios (up to 12), using the volume dial and
tuning dial of the radio as instrumental controls. 15 years
later, Karlheinz Stockhausen’s rigorous approach to the ra-
1
481
dio instrument yielded Kurzwellen (1968), Spiral (1968),
Pole (1970), and Expo (1970), works in which ensembles of
performers use radios to receive and transform sound us-
ing the radio receiver’s aﬀordances. In 1970, one of Stock-
hausen’s performances ofKurzwellen occurred on the Beethoven
centennial, a time at which most radio stations were broad-
casting Beethoven—a ﬁrst hint at the idea of using these
devices to perform a coordinated collection of sounds.[16]
2.1 Precursor: Cassette 100
Maceda’s compositional practice originated from avant-garde
approaches to native Filipino instruments and ethnomu-
sicological research, but evolved towards the use of elec-
tronic devices and musique concrete in the 1950s, a decade
in which he witnessed Varese’s multichannel spectacle Po-
eme Electronique at the 1958 World’s Fair in Brussels, and
worked with Pierre Schaeﬀer in his studio in Paris.
Maceda’s adoption of portable handheld devices is ﬁrst
evident in his compositionCassette 100 (1971), in which 100
performers hold tape players streaming musique concrete
while moving around the concert venue in choreographed
patterns. Cassette 100 is formative for the genre of dis-
tributed music, as it harnesses a mass of handheld devices
as a collective musical instrument, albeit devices which are
held by performers rather than the audience.
2.2 Composition
Maceda composed Ugnayan in the tradition of musique con-
crete, and as an extension of it. He created 20 tapes of 51
minutes each, each tape intended to be broadcast on one
of 37 radio channels in the city of Manila. The tapes con-
tain an elaborate composition for traditional Filipino in-
struments, making use of recent developments in metric
complexity and non-functional harmony (Fig. 2). Maceda
aimed to avoid patterns or functional pitch relationships, in-
stead creating ”atmospheres, waves, clouds, fogs... blocks,
screens and windows of sound” through the dispersal of
sound among so many uncontrolled speakers.[14]
Maceda’s assistant Ram´ on Santos notes how Maceda used
the unique format as a compositional mechanism:
Instead of reprocessing and reshaping these sounds
electronically in a studio, Maceda utilized the
human energies and the physical space of town
plazas and parks to reprocess the sounds in semi-
improvised dispersion schemes. [14]
In other words, Maceda used distribution and participation,
rather than the studio, as a means to compose musique con-
crete, to transform objet sonores into music. Santos contin-
ues that this created:
... a musical experience in which audience, per-
formers, participants, space, and sounds play
equal roles in both the compositional, experien-
tial and re-creative processes. [14]
The title of Ugnayan translates to ”Interlinking”, and has
many meanings within the piece, including the interplay of
dispersed sound events, and the involvement of the audi-
ence within the work, as well as the linking of community
members through social interactions, of music with the sur-
rounding environment, and of traditional instruments with
modern technologies.

2.3 Performance and Legacy
Ugnayan was realized across Manila from 6-7 pm on New
Year’s Day of 1974 (Fig. 1). Santos writes, ”People were
instructed to participate and enjoy the event; e.g. mov-
ing around and listening to the atmospheric changes in the
entire sonic environment.” [14] This reﬂects a casual and
exploratory listening format in common with many current
distributed music concerts.
Maceda’s assistant Ram´ on Santos and composer Chris
Brown note, too, that the performance was in many ways
a failure. It was successful as a political stunt, but lacked
considerable participation from the public, and those who
did participate had mixed responses to the music due to its
avant-garde compositional ideas which clashed with popular
musical tastes. [2]
However, in performing Ugnayan once, Maceda estab-
lished a formal precedent for the use of an audience’s elec-
tronic devices as a speaker array. In addition, the perfor-
mance contributed to redeﬁning the role of the composer
in the latter half of the 20th century. Santos writes that
Maceda ”assigned the primary catalytic role to the people
as partly sharing in the creative process, as performers, and
as the audience.” [14] Maceda’s uncommon ability to com-
mandeer all stations of a radio, and to organize the actions
of an entire town through government propaganda, were
crucial to the creation of Ugnayan, which stands as a tow-
ering precedent for the genre of distributed music.

3. DISTRIBUTED INTERVENTIONS: 1990-
2010
Twenty years after Ugnayan, several artists began to ex-
plore the collective creative potential of electronic devices
of various kinds, demonstrating a variety of diﬀerent path-
ways into distributed music.
3.1 Heath Bunting, Cybercafe (1994)
UK-based artist Heath Bunting’s Cybercafe: Kings Cross
Phone-In was a guerilla performance that turned the pay
phones in London’s Kings Cross train station into a sound
collage. Publicizing the phone numbers of several dozen
Kings Cross payphones via his website, Bunting instructed
anyone to, at 6 PM on August 4, 1994:
(1) call no./nos. and let the phone ring a short
while and then hang up (2) call these nos. in
some kind of pattern (3) call and have a chat
with an expectant or unexpectant person (4) go
to Kings X station watch public reaction/answer
the phones and chat (5) do something diﬀer-
ent.[3]
Bunting seems to comment on the new age of networked
media: that traditional paradigms of one-way communica-
tion (such as a payphone, which normally calls outward)
were disintegrating. He takes a one-way communications
medium and interacts with it, setting a precedent for cur-
rent distributed music paradigms in which a performer sends
messages to an audience’s mobile phone and turns it into a
remote instrument.
3.2 The Flaming Lips, Parking Lot Experi-
ments and Boom Box Experiments (1996)
In 1996, the American rock band The Flaming Lips, based
in Oklahoma City, performed a series of collaborative sound
experiments with collections of car stereos and battery-operated
tape players. In the ﬁrst series, called Parking Lot Exper-
iments, singer Wayne Coyne created 30 individual audio
tapes and handed them out to audience members gathered
at the parking garage of an Oklahoma City mall. Audience
members played the tapes simultaneously on 30 car stereos.
Later that year, the group coordinated events in which au-
dience members brought battery-operated tape players to
play distributed tapes—events known as Boom Box Exper-
iments. At the ﬁrst event, in San Francisco, 100 audience
members participated by adjusting their volume knobs in
response to Coyne’s conducting. The audio content for both
events involved highly independent tapes played simultane-
ously, similar to the model espoused by John Cage.
3.3 Chris Brown and Guillermo Galindo,
Transmission (2002-9)
In the 2000s, Chris Brown and Guillermo Galindo designed
their own distributed radio performances in the spirit of
Jose Maceda, whose work Chris Brown has championed and
helped document. In a series of Transmission performances
including in Mexico City (Fig. 3), Newfoundland, and San
Francisco, Brown and Galindo used homemade low-power
FM transmitters to distribute music over four radio chan-
nels. Audience members were instructed to bring radios to
the event, and were given the same performative role that
Maceda gave to his audience—to freely explore speciﬁc ra-
dio frequencies. Like Maceda’s Ugnayan, events took place
outdoors, in public areas of the city. Sound was broadcast
to and received by the audience, resulting in the composi-
tion emanating from the radios of the audience and mixing
with the city’s environment.

4. FOUNDATIONS: DIALTONES
The ﬁrst years of the 21st century saw a surge in phone
art amid the widespread adoption of mobile phones. The
ringtone became an objet sonore in artworks such as Tele-
phony (2000) by Thomson and Craighead—in which 42 mo-
bile phones placed in a gallery in London were called by
viewers and call each other—and Peter Hrubesch’s Handy-
wolke (2001) in which 1200 mobile phones in a glass dome
ring in response to crowd motion and calls from viewers.
In this context, an ambitious concert was imagined by
Golan Levin, Gregory Shakar, and Scott Gibbons: a con-
cert in which all sound would be made by mobile phones,
primarily the mobile phones of the audience. Dialtones:
A Telesymphony (2001) created ”a chorus of organized so-
cial sound” by placing custom ringtones on the audience’s
mobile phones, and calling them from the stage. [11] Rather
than the political sentiment ofUgnayan, Dialtones was purely
a technological spectacle, a proof of concept of the musical
potentials of a new technology.
4.1 Motivations
The Dialtones performance arose from a variety of motiva-
tions expressed by the creators, including: the opportunity
posed by the mobile phone’s sudden ubiquity; the intention
to illustrate wireless social space; and the intention to treat
the ringtone as a found object in the tradition of media art.
4.1.1 Accessibility
In an interview about Dialtones, Levin describes how the
ubiquity of the mobile phone enabled the work:
Everyone is already carrying enough musical equip-
ment in their pocket to participate in an orches-
tral ensemble. All you have to do is show up
with your instrument, and it’s your phone. [11]
The composers saw the opportunity to coordinate our pocket
musical devices into a new type of mass electronic orches-
tra. By placing custom ringtone melodies on the audience’s
phones, the composers were able to emphasize the synthe-
sis capabilities and musical possibilities of these common
devices.
4.1.2 Social Space
Dialtones illustrated the wireless networks that surround us
daily. As the artist statement for Dialtones states:
3
483
By placing every participant at the center of
a massive cluster of distributed speakers, Dial-
tones makes the ether of cellular space viscerally
perceptible... Everyone has such an individual
relationship with their handset, and to suddenly
think that you’re part of a larger network of peo-
ple... is something that is the case, but is rarely
perceived. [11]
Dialtones can be understood as a soniﬁcation of our soci-
ety’s wireless networks, and as a reaction against the isola-
tion of personal devices.
4.1.3 Dialtones As Media Art
Finally, Dialtones is a fetishization of the ringtone. The
ringtone, in its unique sound and style, is used as a found
object.
The ringing of mobile phones—ordinarily, the
noise of business, of untimely interruptions, of
humans enslaved to technology—is transformed
into a sound of deliberate expression. [11]
While a work like Dialtones appears to be a new and novel
event, it can be equally evaluated as an application of Mod-
ernist concepts to the present, such as: Laszlo Moholy-
Nagy’s philosophy of repurposing communications media
for creative production; the Futurist’s use of materials and
sounds of daily life; and the notion of instrument invention
as a way of accessing new musical forms.
4.2 Composition
Dialtones is structured as a concerto, a logical format for a
piece which addresses the situated opposition of an on-stage
performer and an audience chorus. The composers write:
The goal of Dialtones’ three-part structure is
to introduce the contrasting aesthetic possibil-
ities of virtuosic real-time cellphone performance
(”mobile phone jockeying”) on the one hand, with
coordinated-ensemble handheld-music on the other.
[11]
The ﬁrst section exposes the ”orchestra”—the audience—
through a series of sparse, humorous rings among the au-
dience, then grows to a sustained musical interplay across
audience phones. The second section introduces Scott Gib-
bons as a soloing ”phone jockey” on stage, manually activat-
ing the ringtones of a handful of mobile phones which are
ampliﬁed. The third section joins soloist and audience, as
the performance ”builds to a remarkable crescendo in which
nearly two hundred mobile phones peal simultaneously.”[11]
Like Ugnayan, the composers describe working with ”sound-
textures”rather than precise rhythms and melodies, no doubt
a result of the lack of precise timing when coordinating so
many devices.[11]
4.3 Performance and Legacy
Performed at Ars Electronica in Graz, Austria in 2001,Dial-
tones saw nightly audiences of about 200 participants. The
composers set up a kiosk in the lobby of the concert hall
to download custom ringtones onto the phones of incoming
audience members in order to control the musical content
of the concert (about two thirds of those downloads were
reportedly successful).[11] The composers exerted further
control over the performance by giving each audience mem-
ber a speciﬁc seat in the hall, therefore enabling precise
management of the spatial distribution of sound in the au-
dience during performance (Fig. 4). The venue featured a

sophisticated visualization system wherein lights shone on
audience members as they were being called, and a large
mirror reﬂected a top-down view of the audience back to
itself.
While Dialtones is the most commonly attributed precur-
sor to modern distributed music, it contrasts starkly with
Ugnayan in many respects. Dialtones’ tight control over
seating is rarely seen in contemporary distributed music,
while Maceda’s encouragement that the audience casually
explore and participate in the work is a more common ex-
perience. The sound content of Dialtones is limited, due to
the inﬂexible timbre of the ringtones of that era, whereas
Ugnayan was able to broadcast richer musical content. A
ﬁnal distinction is that the Dialtones audience is passive,
whereas Ugnayan’s is actively interacting with the radio as
a musical interface.
However, Dialtones codiﬁes many aspects of the genre:
harnessing the ubiquitous mobile phone as a sound synthe-
sizer, and using a network to coordinate a variety of sound
events across a concert audience. Levin’s core assertion that
”[the mobile phone’s] potential as an ingredient of art has
been largely overlooked,” [11] however tongue-in-cheek, has
proved prophetic for a generation of mobile musicians and
for the genre of distributed music.
5. EMERGENCE OF A GENRE:
DISTRIBUTED MUSIC
Since the release of the iPhone in 2007, distributed music
has transformed into a more ﬂexible genre and coalesced
around certain modes of implementation. The audio syn-
thesis capabilities of the smartphone allow for richer, more
diverse sound events, and the internet as a coordinator
allows for more sophisticated communication schemes be-
tween performers and individual audience devices. Concerts
have also become more feasible; most concertgoers already
have the requisite materials in their pocket, rather than
needing to show up with a special radio or stereo. Perfor-
mances worldwide from 2010 to 2016 illustrate the prolif-
eration of distributed music and its evolution from native
mobile app instruments to networked web audio systems.

tesy of JODI.
5.1 Native Mobile Apps
From 2012-2014, projects by OK GO, Dan Deacon, Sang
Won Lee, and Xavier Garcia distributed mobile music apps
to their audiences to foster participation. Similar ideas were
already being explored in mobile music, most notably by
the Stanford Mobile Phone Orchestra whose 2010 concert
focused on audience participation through distributed inter-
faces [12]. The strategy of interface distribution inﬁltrated
visual art of the era as well, such as in the art collective
JODI’s ZYX app (2012) which instructs its users to per-
form body gestures, turning an art gallery into a surreal
dance (Fig. 5). It is clear that ideas of mass participa-
tion were percolating in the years following the advent of
the smartphone. Here, we focus on attempts to use this
capability to generate sound from within the audience.
OK GO and NPR, Needing/Getting (2012)
Perhaps the ﬁrst event to use an audience’s smartphones as
a collective instrument, the Los Angeles-based rock band
OK GO collaborated with National Public Radio to cre-
ate an audience participation segment as part of a live ﬁlm
broadcast of the radio show ”This American Life.” The app
gave each audience member three buttons, each an impulse
for one of three notes. The audience was grouped into
four colors—each group with a diﬀerent set of three notes—
therefore achieving twelve diﬀerent notes in all. The audi-
ence followed a scrolling score onscreen that directed them
how to play with beginner-friendly symbols. Fascinatingly,
the band chose to play along as a bell choir—another en-
semble in which each player is responsible for only a hand-
ful of notes, which, played in hocket, are part of a larger
melody created by the ensemble. Broadcast to 300 theaters
across America on May 10, 2012, this led to 300 diﬀerent
distributed concerts occurring at the same time.
Dan Deacon, America (2012)
During the same year, Keith Lea at Wham City Lights de-
veloped a standalone mobile app to accompany Baltimore
electronic musician Dan Deacon’sAmerica album tour. Pri-
marily a lightshow app, the app was advertised to also cre-
ate a sonic accompaniment to the music performed. The
app used an ultrasonic audio impulse to synchronize phones
to within 0.06 seconds. 1 The ﬁrst concert occurred in Des
Moines, Iowa, on July 7, 2012 and the band proceeded to
perform with the app in over 50 other performances.
Sang Won Lee, Echobo (2012)
Sang Won Lee’s Echobo [10] [9] is a mobile instrument that
is designed to be played by untrained audience members.

app which lets them play piano notes through a graphical
interface. The cloud of audience notes creates a background
texture while an electronic musician and acoustic musician
perform on stage.
Xavier Garcia, Belzebuth (2014)
Xavier Garcia’s Belzebuth (2014), a 13-minute perfor-
mance with the participation of the audience, was com-
missioned by Grame as part of their SmartFaust concert
series featuring apps developed with the Faust language. In
the Belzebuth app, the audience uses gesture, rather than a
touch interface, to create sound, and are guided through a
series of gestures by a conductor. The audience downloads
the app beforehand through the web. Garcia notes how par-
ticipation can change a viewer’s experience and help them
understand the act of musical composition: ”getting on the
side of doing, [the audience] will experience a new audio
sound as material, texture etc.” [6] therefore giving the au-
dience insight into the compositional process.
5.2 Web Audio
Since the adoption of the Web Audio API2 in mobile browsers
in 2014-2015, and in tandem with open-source technologies
developed within the Node.js framework, a number of dis-
tributed music performances have occurred which use web-
sites as remotely-controlled audio synthesizers. While live
audio streaming to audience devices is not yet a reality, per-
formers can send small packets of control data to the audi-
ence in order to control web audio synthesis on the client-
side. As Thomas Dolby—an early adopter of web-based
audio—joked: you cannot send a cake through a phone line,
but you can send the recipe if you’ve got ﬂour, milk, and
eggs on the other end.[4] Performances in this modality led
to a series of entirely distributed concerts at the 2015 and
2016 Web Audio Conferences at IRCAM and Georgia Tech.
Tim Shaw and S´ ebastien Piquemal,Fields (2014)
One of the earliest distributed music performances to use
web audio as a sound engine, Fields [15] premiered at the
CTM (Club Transmediale) Festival on January 2014 in Berlin.
In the work, all audience members with smartphones opened
a mobile website containing a web audio engine. One per-
former sent control messages via WebSockets to create mu-
sic in the audience’s browsers (Fig. 6), while another per-
former played a Pure Data patch through speakers on stage.
These two soundscapes combined into a landscape of natu-
ral sounds emanating from within the audience.
IRCAM, CoSiMa and Collective Soundchecks (2014)
In a series of events and demos called Collective Sound-
checks, beginning in May 2014, IRCAM’s CoSiMa group
explores many diﬀerent modalities of collaborative perfor-
mance using smartphones, inspired by the conﬂuence of the
smartphone’s ubiquity, multimodal sensors, real-time audio-
visual processing, and web standards. [13] In the composi-
tion Drops by Norbert Schnell and S´ ebastien Robaszkiewicz,
melodic fragments played by individual audience members
are sent from phone to phone and resynthesized, creating
an echo eﬀect and motivic relationships across the audience.
The group leads several initiatives to expand the capabili-
ties of distributed music, such as achieving precise synchro-
nization of musical events across phones. [8] Collaborative
Soundchecks continue to be performed at events worldwide.

ence mobile devices, deploys live audio recordings in real
time to audience phones. As a vocalist sings the titular
Greek poem, samples of the singer’s voice are recorded and
transmitted asynchronously to audience devices, where they
play in a dispersed cloud. Houge notes how the performance
correlates to the ritual gathering described in the poem, as
well as the poem’s description of wandering through a vast
archive. [7] Houge also mentions that he aims ”to accept
the sound of the phone and timing inaccuracies as an asset
and build those attributes into the composition.”
Web Audio Conference (2015-2016)
The ﬁrst Web Audio Conference, held at IRCAM in Jan-
uary, 2015, featured a concert consisting solely of distributed
music performances using web audio technologies. The fol-
lowing works were performed: Ben Houge, The Tomb of
the Grammarian Lysias (2014); S´ ebastien Robaszkiewicz
and Norbert Schnell, Drops (2014); Jesse Allison, Traver-
sal (2015); Kita Toshihiro, Smartphone Jam Session with
Audience (2015); Ben Taylor, Pearl River (2015); and
Tim Shaw and S´ ebastien Piquemal, Fields (2014).
The 2016 conference featured a distributed music concert
of the following works: Ben Houge , Ornithological Blog
Poem (2016); Andrey Bundin, Concert for Smartphones
(2015); William Walker and Brian Belet , Cross-Town
Traﬃc 2.0 (2016); Sang Won Lee and Antonio de Car-
valho Jr, Crowd in Cloud (2016); Nihar Madhavan and
Jeﬀ Snyder, Constellation (2015).
6. CONCLUSIONS
Distributed music arose not from the smartphone, but from
a common interest across many practices to harness every-
day electronic devices as distributed sound agents. Com-
posers distributed music by: broadcasting sound over radio,
handing out cassette tapes, downloading ringtones, sharing
musical mobile apps, and sending live control messages to
web audio engines in mobile web browsers. In each of these
instances, composers arrived at distributed music by explor-
ing the aﬀordances of everyday technology.
This history conveys not one modality of performance,
but a diverse array of practices. Divergent choices among
these works include: whether the audience should partici-
pate in musical decisions, or be a passive receiver; whether
the timing inaccuracies of latency should be adopted as part
of the medium, or eliminated; whether to discern the loca-
tion of each audience member or not; and whether the audi-
ence’s devices should provide an accompaniment for stage
sound or be the sole source of music. Regardless of in-
dividual perspectives among these choices, the worldwide
emergence of this genre indicates that, beyond its novelty,
it oﬀers a substantial new mode of musical expression.
