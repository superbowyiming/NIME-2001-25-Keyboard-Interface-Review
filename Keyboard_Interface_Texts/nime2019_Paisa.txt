ABSTRACT
This project describes a novel approach to hybrid electro-
acoustical instruments by augmenting the Sensel Morph,
with real-time audio sensing capabilities. The actual action-
sounds are captured with a piezoelectric transducer and pro-
cessed in Max 8 to extend the sonic range existing in the
acoustical domain alone. The control parameters are cap-
tured by the Morph and mapped to audio algorithm propri-
eties like ﬁlter cutoﬀ frequency, frequency shift or overdrive.
The instrument opens up the possibility for a large selection
of diﬀerent interaction techniques that have a direct impact
on the output sound. The instrument is evaluated from a
sound designer’s perspective, encouraging exploration in the
materials used as well as techniques. The contribution are
two-fold. First, the use of a piezo transducer to augment
the Sensel Morph aﬀords an extra dimension of control on
top of the oﬀerings. Second, the use of acoustic sounds from
physical interactions as a source for excitation and manipu-
lation of an audio processing system oﬀers a large variety of
new sounds to be discovered. The methodology involved an
exploratory process of iterative instrument making, inter-
spersed with observations gathered via improvisatory trials,
focusing on the new interactions made possible through the
fusion of audio-rate inputs with the Morph’s default inter-
action methods.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Morph is a new multi-touch interface created by the
company Sensel. It is a 240mm by 138mm multi-touch
pressure sensitive control surface that is provided with an
API directly from the developers[1]. This makes it easily
re-conﬁgurable and encourages experimentation across dif-
ferent domains, including musical interaction. The interface
senses pressures ranging from 5g to 5kg per touch, with a

resolution of 15 bits and a multi-touch limit of 16 simultane-
ous inputs. It is capable of running at 125Hz with a latency
of 8ms and tracking precision of 6502dpi in Full resolution
Mode, or at 500Hz and 2ms latency at a lower precision in
High Speed Mode[1]. The Morph comes with native support
for overlays: modular silicone surfaces with various layouts
that attach magnetically to the interface and change how
the hardware responds to inputs (Figure 1). At the moment
of writing, there are 8 diﬀerent overlays for the Morph, each
providing an unique interactive interface for diﬀerent pur-
poses. The overlays are detected by the Morph that loads
a pre-saved mapping scheme when one is attached. How-
ever, it can also be used without an overlay, providing an
opportunity for slightly more subtlety and nuance in per-
formance, as direct-touch interactions without an overlay
captures user input with no barrier.
Figure 1: Sensel Morph and overlays
The device makes it easy to interface with a computer
in many applications, but due to the relative low sampling
frequency (even at 500Hz) it cannot be used to detect au-
dio events that might encode useful information such as
sharp impacts that generate higher frequencies, or even dis-
tinguish materials of impact from one another (ﬁngertip /
knuckle / nail). This projects explores the beneﬁts of aug-
menting the Sensel Morph with audio-rate capabilities by
creating a new musical interface that uses an extra real-
time signal captured by a simple contact microphone as the
source for an expressive synthesizer built in Max 8 1. It is
worth mentioning that the use case chosen for this applica-
tion serves as an example of the combined technologies, but
the possibilities expand beyond those covered in this work.
2. BACKGROUND
There are many existing instruments and products based on
touch and physical interactions with the body of the instru-
ment, combined with digital or analog processing. These in-
clude projects such as Aimi’s Sampled Acoustics approach

[2], Merrill, et al.’s Sound of Touch[3], Tomas’ Tangible
Scores [4], Dahlstedt’s hybrid digital keyboard [5] or Lahdeoja’s
augmented electric guitar [6]. There are also commercial
products available, aimed at augmented everyday objects
such as tables, etc. such as the Mogees add-on for iOS de-
vices (based on a contact microphone and machine learning
software).2
3. IMPLEMENTATION
This project is built using three core technologies. First is
the Sensel Morph, utilized without any overlays in order to
avoid potential audio ﬁltering by the silicone pad, as well as
preserving the absolute minimum force detection threshold
for the maximum range of expression. The second com-
ponent is a piezoelectric transducer connected to an audio
interface. The transducer is in direct contact with the top
metallic part of the Sensel. Lastly, there is Cycling 74’sMax
8 (previously known as Max/MSP) tying the two hardware
elements together as well as providing the audio processing
platform.
3.1 Hardware
There are several types of piezoelectric transducers or con-
tact microphones that could be used for capturing the sig-
nal form the Morph, but due to availability only three have
been investigated: a clip-on, dampened one sold as acoustic
guitar pickup, and two bare bone piezo discs with diameters
of 1 and 2 centimeters. Since most such devices come with-
out proper documentation, the frequency response of each
transducer is unknown, and the discrimination has been
made purely on listening tests conducted between the au-
thors. The criteria observed was the captured diﬀerence be-
tween several types of impact materials (ﬁnger, nails, plas-
tic, rubber), strengths and techniques (direct hit, brush,
hit+brush, scratch, etc.). Based on this criteria is was con-
cluded that the guitar pickup was the least sensitive to vari-
ation, probably due to the damping material on top of the
piezo disc. This translated into a low-pass ﬁlter-like behav-
ior, capturing most hits with various materials in a similar
way. An exception would be the brush and scratch interac-
tions, due to their time domain characteristics that makes
them easily identiﬁable. When it comes with the two piezo
discs, the larger one captured a higher amount of high fre-
quency content, making it the most sensitive of the three,
for the current application.
Each sensor was tested on various locations on the Morph
concluding that the highest ﬁdelity signal is captured on the
touching surface, but the most convenient is the exposed
metal middle portion on the top of the interface. This was
the position where the sensors was placed for this project.
The underside of the device also provides good signal rep-
resentation but proved to be susceptible to friction sounds
produces by the Morph’s micro-slides on a table. It is worth
mentioning that the Morph has rubber feet that are 0.75mm
thick providing suﬃcient dampening to decouple interface
from the table.
A constant between the three investigated transducers is
the frequency response characteristics of the Morph that
made discrimination between some type of hits more diﬃ-
cult. This was particularly evident when performing similar
hits with the ﬁnger tip, the nail and rubber. The resulting
frequency response is fairly similar as can be seen in Fig-
ure (2). The piezoelectric transducers were connected to
the computer through a Behringer UM2 audio interface and
sampled at 44.1KHz, with a buﬀer length of 256 samples.

3.2 Software
The software side of the system was build in the Max 8
environment that supports the Sensel Morph natively, and
oﬀers a plethora of audio processing tools.
3.3 Impact discrimination
Before explaining the signal processing chain, it is worth
mentioning that an initial attempt at real-time discrimina-
tion between interaction materials based on the captured
audio signal has been partially unsuccessful. According to
Hjortkjaer and McAdams, both temporal and spectral cues
can be used to discriminate between materials and action
categories in impacted sounds[7]. The authors found though
that for single, discrete hits, temporal cues are more reliable,
while spectral cues are beneﬁcial when resonance occurs, or
there are repeated hits in a short time period. With respect
to this, three methods have been implemented with various
degree of success. These discriminating factors were used
as training data for a supervised machine learning (ML) al-
gorithm implemented in Wekinator [8]. For each method,
more than 100 samples for each type of hit were recorded
as training data.
Spectral centroid analysis was the ﬁrst attempted method.
The ML system could not discriminate at all between hits
with the tip of the ﬁnger, nails, rubber or a pen, outputting
arbitrary classiﬁcation with no observable consistency. This
may have been due to the naturally occurring ﬁltering that
the physical construction of the Morph provides (Figure 2).
The second discrimination method used a bounded-Q anal-
ysis of an incoming sound to detect onsets of percussion in-
struments, as implemented in the bonk˜ object developed
by M.Puckette [9]. Two independent trials have been made
with 11 and 22 ﬁlter banks, and the results were consistent
between them. The discrimination between pen hits and ev-
erything else was reliable, working for almost all amplitudes
of hit force. The results were not as clear when it came to
diﬀerentiate between ﬁnger tip, nail and rubber, but there
were several cases when the algorithm consistently detected
nail hits. This required a particular interaction technique
of hitting the morph with the back of the nail at an angle
of approx 45 degrees. When it comes to classifying diﬀerent
types of interactions, Wekinator was especially successful at
diﬀerentiating brushes and scratches from hits and knocks.
Similar results were obtained from using the built-in classi-
ﬁer implemented in bonk , but with less accuracy.
The last discrimination method looked at a pure time do-
main characteristic in an attempt to improve the existing
results. An augmented envelope follower algorithm was im-
plemented, that calculated the maximum diﬀerence between
two consecutive samples, on the assumption that a hit with
a harder material will have a shorter attack than a similar
hit with a softer material. While the results were sometimes
299
accurate, the main diﬀerence seemed to come from the ac-
tual hit force rather than the material, as a hard object will
hit with a higher force due to the smaller area of impact.
Because of the inconsistency in the discrimination, the
materials’ impact characteristics have been deemed unnec-
essary for this stage of the project. Nevertheless, consider-
ing that all the audio produced by the system originates in
the signal captured by the piezo disc, an audible diﬀerence
between materials is still present in the system.
3.4 Signal chain processing
The signal chain is separated in four distinct stages: pre-
processing, envelope, manipulation, and eﬀects. All sounds
were produced using the exact same patch, with minor vari-
ations in the envelope stage.
The pre-processing stage aims at preparing the signal for
the next steps by eliminating unwanted spectral compo-
nents while producing a usable dynamic range. To achieve
this a total of 3 ﬁlters are used in series: one state vari-
able ﬁlter(SVF) in band-pass mode tuned at 50hz to reduce
the electric hum, one biquad resonant high-pass ﬁlter with
a cutoﬀ frequency of 5500Hz and a Q of 0.1, in order to
remove the noise introduced by the audio interface and a
subtle boost in the frequencies above 5000 was applied in
order to compensate for the decrease in sensitivity intro-
duced by the Morph’s body, as seen in Figure 2. The next
step in this pre-processing stage is to apply a noise gate with
a threshold just under the noise ﬂoor, followed by compres-
sion.
The envelope stage dictates the temporal characteristics
of the signal being mapped to the amplitude, and it is only
triggered by touching the Morph on it’s sensor area. If
the aluminum case or the piezo are touched, the following
two stages are bypassed, feeding the audio signal directly
into the global eﬀects. Several envelopes are used, all of
which feature a 4 point Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release struc-
ture(Figure 3). Since most sounds that can be produced by
interacting with the Morph are impacts, all envelopes used
have a relatively short attack time.
Figure 3: Example of used envelope
The next stage deals with manipulating the incoming sig-
nal in order to aﬀord expressivity and produce rich and
interesting sounds. The ﬁrst step in this stage aims at en-
riching the spectral characteristics of the signal. This is
achieved by applying a time domain frequency shift to pro-
duce an extra series of harmonics followed by soft clipping,
providing overdrive to enrich the result. This process is
repeated to further enhance the spectral content. The re-
sultant signal is pitch shifted (transposed) with a variable
glide time using a ZTX-based real-time pitch shift [10]. All
the parameters described so far are user controllable. From
this point on the signal splits into left and right channel, one
going into the eﬀects, while the other is further over-driven
before passing through a resonant band-pass ﬁlter with a
variable center frequency that is user controlled.
The ﬁnal stage consists of a stereo pair of delays with 5
lines with ﬁxed lengths and gains. This is done to create
an optional rhythm in the sounds. There is no feedback in
the delay implementation. The dry and delayed signals are
passed to a pair of reverberators with identical parameters,
as described by [11]. The ﬁnal stereo signal is ﬁltered using a
state variable ﬁlter in low pass mode, with user controllable
cutoﬀ frequency.
3.5 Parameters and Mapping
The mapping is done using a many-to-many approach[12].
The aim of this method is to create an expressive inter-
face that provides a certain complexity level to the user, as
suggested by Hunt et. all [13]. The authors claim that by
providing a challenge to the user, the reward from interact-
ing with an instrument with complex mappings provides a
feeling of better expressivity.
The parameters provided by the Sensel Morph’s API are
as follows: x-y coordinates, force, as well as the number
of detected contact points. The API provides a detailed
description of the contact area’s shape, but since most ex-
pected interactions are short hits, thus having an uncontrol-
lable contact shape, these descriptors have been ignored.
All values have been normalized based on the author’s ex-
perienced extremes.
The X coordinate of a detected impact point was mapped
to the center frequency of the resonant band-pass in the
manipulation stage. The mapping is exponential from 20
to 1000Hz, left to right. This is the main tonal control of
the entire interface; therefore it needs to be explicit. By
using a previously known mapping scheme: left for lower
tones right for higher ones (as found in a piano) it should
not provide any challenges for the user.
The same coordinate axis is mapped to the transpose
function as described in the manipulation stage. The overall
range is 4 octaves, left to right, with no shift in the mid-
dle of the Morph. The mapping is linear and is continuous.
This parameter’s eﬀect is directly linked to the glide time.
The Y coordinate is mapped to three distinct control
parameters. The most noticeable impact comes from the
global SVF’s cutoﬀ frequency, that is mapped linearly from
20 to 3000hz, bottom to top. This eﬀect is emphasized by a
perceived increase in amplitude as hits on the top part are
closer to the pickup. Furthermore, the Y axis dictates the
amount of frequency shift in the manipulation stage. The
mapping is exponential, from 1 to 11, top to bottom and
the same value is passed to both frequency shifters. This
parameter controls one aspect of the spectral richness, not
related to the pitch shifting. It should be noted that the
two described controls work in opposite directions, creating
a harmonically rich, but ﬁltered sounds on the bottom side
of the Morph, and less ﬁltered sounds closer to the top.
Lastly, Y is mapped to the glide time of the pitch shifting
algorithm. It ranges from 1 to 10000ms and is mapped
linearly.
The last parameter, the force, was mapped to the amount
of overdrive applied in between frequency shifters, as de-
scribed in the manipulation stage. Its spectrum is from
1 (no overdrive) to 11. It is worth mentioning that force
is updated in real time, having a behavior very similar to
after-touch.
4. INTERACTION TECHNIQUES
This section will describe the intended and discovered inter-
actions that produce interesting and desirable sounds using
the system. This is not a complete list of sounds possible,
300
but rather an attempt to describe the wide range of interac-
tions possible. Some of the action-sounds described below
can be witnessed in the video associated with this paper.
Single percussive hits probably come to mind ﬁrst when
seeing the Morph. Playing it like a ﬁnger drum pad with
either one or two ﬁnger produces impact sounds that range
from a sub bass kick drum sound (reminiscent of the Roland
808 kick) to sounds similar to hitting an empty glass bottle,
depending on the hitting position and intensity. It is some-
what easy to play in tune if one memorizes the locations for
certain desired notes. A variation of this interaction uses
the knuckle to knock on the Morph. However, this action
will most likely clip the signal as such motions are usually
associated with a higher forces.
Multiple ﬁnger hits from both hands in rapid succession
create an intricate pattern that either descends or ascends
in pitch depending on the tapping order. This can be rem-
iniscent of rain-stick sounds, partially because of the noise
component present in the incoming signal and partially be-
cause of the delay eﬀect that further adds to similar sounds
to the mix. This motion usually applies less force on the
device, thus creating less of a tonal sound.
As mentioned earlier, impulses coming from hands have
a similar spectral characteristic, therefore producing rather
similar tonal results. An exception to this rule is the mo-
tion resembling the Nike swoosh. If passed to an envelope
similar to one in Figure 3, it creates a two-stage sound with
a sharp,noisy attack and decay, followed by a more gentle,
tonal sound that uses the manipulation stage to a higher
degree. This motion can accentuate the pitch-shifting char-
acteristic and produces nice bass tones if used on the left
side of the Morph.
The Morph’s contact surface is covered with a very slip-
pery material, but with enough practice one can produce
a stick-slip motion creating complex rhythmical and tonal
sounds, depending on the sliding direction. For instance, if
moving diagonally from bottom left to top right, the sounds
increases in pitch, but at the same time it opens up the
global SVF, oﬀering a crescendo eﬀect. This motion is usu-
ally achieved by pressing hard on the Morph, an action that
is directly mapped to an overdrive parameter in the manip-
ulation stage.
Interacting with the Morph is not limited to ﬁnger/hand
motions and can be extended to virtually any object, with
respect to the Morph’s physical dimensions. One object
that produced pleasing results was a metal case ﬁlled with
M2.5 screws slid on the Morph produces an atonal, rhythmi-
cally rich sound. This is especially interesting when tossed
on the Y axis, thus opening or closing the ﬁlter. This sound
can be associated with riser sound, popular in electronic mu-
sic, but considerably richer(risers are usually ﬁltered noise).
Another interesting sound was produced by rolling a AA
battery over the entire width of the Morph. This interaction
produced a tonal (de)crescendo, similar to a tone sweep. If
the rolling is rather diagonal than horizontal, the ﬁltering
and frequency-shifters adds character to the sound. A last
example of unique action-sound can be found in a spinning
top toy, a coin, or a common glass rotating in balance on the
surface. There is a continuous contact point creating a long,
evolving sound. The more the object moves on the surface
of the Morph while spinning, the greater the variation in
the sound it can create.
5. DISCUSSION
The main contribution of this project is the augmentation
of the Sensel Morph with real-time audio input to bring
back the possibilities of acoustic interaction. The Morph is
an outstanding device in itself, but it can be transformed
into an electro-acoustic instrument with audio augmenta-
tion. Many such instruments have been built recently, as
mentioned in the background section, but this project is a
hybrid in a rather diﬀerent way - the controls represent the
sound sources and the two cannot be decoupled without a
redesign of the mapping layer. Bringing the richness and di-
versity of acoustically produced sounds as part of the a digi-
tal instrument, greatly enhances the sonic range, the action-
sound palette and its expressivity. One can physically inter-
act with the device in inﬁnitely many diﬀerent ways serv-
ing as an open ended platform for exploration and sound
variation in the hands of a performer. This key element
as well as the introducing the stochastic nature of physical
action-sound, so hard to reproduce synthetically, makes the
augmented Sensel Morph an unique instrument. As men-
tioned before, the software implementation presented in this
project serves as an example for the possible physical inter-
action and it’s correlated sounds thus it can be concluded
that the augmented Morph could have totally diﬀerent sonic
characteristics.
5.1 Expressivity and playability
All acoustic instruments come with a physical challenge over
control and usually have a balance between the amount of
control over each voice and the number of voices[12, 13].
The same can be said about this project. On top of that,
having the control gestures have a direct impact on the
sound captured by the piezo, further increasing the cog-
nitive load. This does not mean that the instrument is im-
possible to play, but it does require some practice in order
to have control over the outcome. Nevertheless, the oppor-
tunity of acoustical control available literally at the player’s
ﬁnger tips is a strong feature, and makes for the largest
portion of expression possibilities [14].
5.2 Repeatability
Acoustic sounds have complex spectral and temporal char-
acteristics, such that absolute repetitiveness is diﬃcult, if
not impossible via human control. The same can be said
about the gestural interaction controlling the sound, espe-
cially true since the Morph does not have any visual or
haptic cues to help the player in their quest for consistency.
However, the system will react consistent to identical in-
puts, a characteristic that is common among most acous-
tic instruments. This does not mean that all features are
equally easy to control. For instance, ﬁnding the exact lo-
cation on the X axis where the resonating ﬁlters are in a
certain tuning is diﬃcult, because there are no real refer-
ence points on the Morph. Quantization could be a possible
solution for this problem, but the result would be more ster-
ile, perfectly repeatable sound known to push players away
in longer-term playing.
5.3 The sound
The sound of the system is dictated by the processing done
in Max 8. The focus during development was on action-
sound aspects, and how could those be translated into musi-
cally suﬃcient and rich sounds. In order to achieve this, the
mapping scheme many-to-many provided rich sound varia-
tions with little eﬀort, but understanding the complexities
and how to control them is not trivial. The system is ﬂexi-
ble enough to provide a wide sonic palette that ranges from
percussive sounds to tonal, melodic ones. Considering that
the interaction object and it’s material have a large impact
on the resulting sound (a characteristic of percussion in-
struments) and the interaction technique plays a similarly
important role, it is hard to describe the sound of this sys-
301
tem. Nonetheless, there are physical constrains regarding
the hardware and it’s proprieties. For instance, the Morph,
like any other object, has a resonant frequency that is accen-
tuated through the processing developed. In addition, the
frequency response of the piezoelectric transducer could be
improved through the use of an impedance-matching trans-
former, and/or the use of a less resonant ceramic disc type of
piezoelectric transducer. These factors contributed to some-
times distorted and overly-accentuated frequencies, usually
triggered in the middle of the Morph, and might be allevi-
ated by incorporating such hardware improvements.
6. CONCLUSION
This paper presents a multi-touch hybrid acoustic-digital
instrument based on augmenting the Sensel Morph, with
real-time audio sensing capabilities. The system oﬀers ex-
tensive interaction possibilities while maintaining the in-
tuitive aspect of percussive instrumental techniques. The
acoustic input from the piezoelectric transducer is used as
the only source of audio input. This is processed in Max 8
to enrich the sound and oﬀer a much broader range of pos-
sible spectral and temporal characteristics, while oﬀering a
high degree of control over the resulting sonic output via the
pressure sensing matrix inside the Morph. The instrument
aﬀords a large variety of interaction techniques ranging from
single ﬁnger hits, to more complex and creative actions, like
using a spinning top.
The synthesis engine is relatively simple, yet the map-
ping layer is somewhat complex. This system is only used
as an example of the possibilities oﬀered by augmenting
the Morph with audio-rate sensing. Nevertheless, the in-
strument provides a remarkably satisfying experience for a
curious player, heavily encouraging experimentation. In the
hands of an professional musician it can provide a platform
for new sounds, given that the performer is willing to dis-
cover and practice new ways of interacting with the musical
instrument.
