ABSTRACT
Within the music improvisation and jazz scenes, playing a
wrong note may be seen as a source of creativity and nov-
elty, where an initially undesired factor (the mistaken note)
invites the musician to leverage their skills to transform it
into new musical material. How does this idea, however,
translate into more experimental scenes like NIME, where
control and virtuosity are not necessarily the performance’s
aims? Moreover, within NIME communities the addition
of randomness or constraints to musical instruments is of-
ten an intended aesthetic decision rather than a source of
mistakes. To explore this contrast, we invited four NIME
practitioners to participate in the Self-Sabotage Workshop,
where each practitioner had to build their own sabotag-
ing elements for their musical instruments and to give a
short demonstration with them. We gathered participants’
impressions of self-sabotating in a focus group, inquiring
about control and musicality, and also the strategies they
developed for coping with the self-sabotaged instruments.
We discuss the emergent ideas of planned and unplanned
sabotaging, and we propose a starting point towards the
idea of self-sabotaging as a continuous design and musical
process where designers/musicians try to overcome barriers
that they impose upon themselves.

Several well-known music improvisers and composers have
developed strategies to get out from their usual comfort
zone in what De Souza has called voluntary self-sabotage

patterns [11]. De Souza also cites John Cage’s prepared pi-
ano where he adds screws and bolts to the strings so the
results from musicians actions become unpredictable [11].
Hamilton [15] has referred to this attitude of openness to
the uncertain as the aesthetics of imperfection - not to be
confused with Cascone’s aesthetics of failure [7], which fo-
cuses on the value of technological rather than human im-
perfections - where musicians are in a “constant striving for
new contingencies to respond to” [15]. For the imperfec-
tionist, mistakes and the moving out from usual patterns
are embraced as a source of new materials [1, 15, 31]. As a
famous quote attributed to Miles Davis says: “Do not fear
mistakes - there are none” [1]. A wrong note is nothing but
“a hole to play your way out of” [22].
However, terms like sabotaging, risk, errors and mistakes
have a highly subjective character. The random retuning
of a string, for example, could be seen as a negative ob-
struction for a standard jazz improviser, while it could be
an intentional and desired technique for a free improviser
for whom the pitch of sounds might not be that impor-
tant. This is even more critical in emergent or experimental
communities like NIME, where the aesthetic identities are
not well-defined [28]. Moreover, loss of control or adding
randomness is sometimes included as an intended aesthetic
decision in NIME practice [37, 17, 4].
What does self-sabotage mean then for a NIME practi-
tioner? Could self-sabotage bring new values and practices
into the NIME arena or, rather, are these values already
present in established NIME practices, only with different
names? With these questions in mind we ran a Self Sabo-
taging Workshop, where we invited four NIME practitioners
(the four participants were designers of instruments, mu-
sic performers and have published in NIME) to design and
build their own self-sabotaging elements and to provide a
short improvised performance with them. The workshop
included a focus group reflection where we collected the im-
pressions of participants around the concepts of control, mu-
sicallity, and the strategies to cope with the self-sabotaging
instruments.
In this paper, we begin by framing and motivating the
spirit of the workshop through a review of previous sabotag-
ing instruments which we define as any instrument that has
been designed or modified with the aim of challenging mu-
sicians through unexpected or unfamiliar functioning. We
then present the method and resulting self-sabotaging in-
struments of our workshop and discuss the creative strug-
gle between human and technological factors present in the
design and musical process. We provide a starting point
for situating self-sabotaging as a design and musical prac-
tice that involves three main stages: (i) the drawing of
practitioner-specific aesthetic and musical boundaries (the
planning stage), (ii) a resulting network of interrelated hu-
man and material sabotaging factors (the implementation
stage), and (iii) an openness towards coping both with the
planned and unplanned sabotaging factors that emerge when
interacting with the instrument (the musicking [34] stage).
2. RELATED WORK
De Souza [11] recognizes three categories of self-sabotaging
strategies: (i) retuned instruments (e.g. moving a string
to a new tuning as per Rosenwinkel), (ii) prepared instru-
ments (e.g. adding objects in the sound production part
of the instrument like Cage’s screws and bolts in the pi-
ano), and (iii) redesigned instruments (directly modifying
the body of the instrument) [11]. However, this catego-
rization quickly becomes problematic in the context of new
musical developments such as Digital Musical Instruments
or Augmented Musical Instruments [26]. For instance, if
we digitally remap the keys of an electronic piano so that
it outputs guitar-like sounds, is this then a prepared piano
or a retuned piano? (or maybe even a redesigned guitar?)
We propose as a starting point the well-known distinction
between the controller - the part of the instrument through
which the musician interacts with it - and the sound synthe-
sis - the part of the instrument that manipulates the signals
and maps them into sounds [9] - as we find this distinction
useful to structure our review of previous related work. To
focus our review - and still keeping an open definition of
self-sabotaging - we review works that explicitly look for an
unfamiliar or unexpected interaction between the performer
and the instrument - we call these cases simply sabotaging
examples. In doing so we identify sabotage examples that
relate to a wide range of concepts such as risk, constraints,
intrusions, randomness, non-linearity and chaos, and errors.
2.1 Sabotaging the controller
2.1.1 Resizing the controller
The size of the controller shapes, to some extent, the size
of the performer’s gestures [2]. In this sense, resizing the
instrument could be an intentional strategy to invite the
performer for risky behaviour or even struggling to control.
For example, in the Absurd Hackathon reported by Lepri et
al [18], participants created the Pipe Technology Project, a
magnified interface with 1.5 meter long sliders and knobs
with 1 meter radius. As the creators commented, their aim
was to emphasise the effort and the physicallity required by
the controls, and to explore how this shapes the experience
of performing. Similarly, Mice and McPherson [25] explore
how large-scale instruments invite to highly embodied in-
teractions and risky gestures.
2.1.2 Constraining the controller
While resizing relates to sabotage through risk and effort,
constraining the controller could constitute a sabotaging be-
cause of gestural familiarity and expressivity.
Firstly, when constraining an already familiar instrument
(for example, blocking some parts of the instrument), the
main sabotaging factor is habits. As described by Martel-
loni et al with their wrapped guitar [20], constraining a fa-
miliar controller brings a “fight with muscle memory” when
adapting to the new constraints, as the body keeps repeat-
ing learnt gestures that can be no longer useful.
Secondly, highly constrained interfaces could represent a
sabotage in terms of the expressive possibilities of the per-
former. Gurevich et al [14] and also Zappi and McPherson
[38] explored a one-button musical and low-dimensional in-
teractive interfaces, respectively. Both studies found, per-
haps counter-intuitively, that this seemingly sabotaging fac-
tor ended up leading to innovative and expressive interac-
tions, with performers appropriating the instrument and
finding a wide variety of hidden affordances - affordances
that are discovered by the performers and that aren’t ex-
pected from the design process [13].
There can also be constraints that go beyond the phys-
ical or mechanical modifications of the controller. Indeed,
the instrument can provoke specific (e.g. risky) attitudes
or dynamics through the imposing of specific rules for its
manipulation. For example, Bin et al [3] designed Keppi, a
digital music instrument that, if not moved enough, would
stop working. Performers showed a positive response to the
effort needed to make Keppi work, suggesting interesting
guidelines for the design of challenging instruments [3].
2.2 Sabotaging the synthesis
The arbitrary mapping nature of DMIs allows to explore
non-familiar [33, 32], random [10], chaotic [30], or unex-
pected outputs [18, 22]. We can trace this back to Waisvisz
foundational “The Hands”, where control inputs are at some
moments transformed to wild and unexpected outputs [36].
More recently, non-linear and chaotic mappings have re-
ceived particular attention - for example, Rob Hordijk’s
Blippo Box [16] or John BowersFractal Knob [5] and Fucked
Up MIDI Controller [18] - because of their possibility of dis-
playing a broad range of responses and surprising changes,
yet still in a deterministic way [30]. For example, Mudd et al
[30] developed and studied a series of interfaces that applied
different non-linear mappings to the controls. Participants
experienced what Mudd defines as “edge-like interactions”,
which means an engagement with the instrument through
a compromise between surprise and control. It was found
that musicians liked to be challenged and surprised by the
sounds they obtained, leading to creative and explorative
behavior.
Scott McLaughlin goes somewhat further away by remap-
ping one music variable (time) into a different one (pitch).
In his composition Bifurcations in a Continuous System [22]
a professional pianist follows a score and plays a keyboard
where the pitch of a note is derived not from which key was
depressed but from the time duration between key-presses.
Given the impossibility of performers following a perfectly
constant tempo, the errors they made (the variations from
the rule) mapped to unexpected new sounds.
Finally, although not strictly a remapping, feedback sys-
tems also offer non-linear and highly non predictable or con-
trollable outputs [24, 8, 12]. Moreover, Melbye asserts that
with his Feedback-actuated Augmented Bassthe closed feed-
back system is not only disruptive or resistant, but it even
displays a seemingly autonomous behaviour, raising ques-
tions about agency in performance [24].
3. SELF-SABOTAGE WORKSHOP
The instruments described above mostly involved sabotag-
ing elements that a designer or composer externally imposed
upon the performer, neglecting the highly subjective char-
acter of struggling, making errors, and sabotaging itself.
Furthermore, these works usually focus on the instruments
functionalities or the creative capabilities that they foster,
but there’s no exploration of the design process that led to
the particular sabotaging elements. As a starting point to
explore these intimate and highly subjective design and mu-
sical processes, we ran a Self-Sabotage Workshop, where we
invited four NIME practitioners to participate in a 6-hours
workshop in which they would develop their own sabotag-
ing devices. Instead of building final functional or highly
engaging interfaces, the aim of the workshop was to explore
the problematic, to examine the struggling that emerges
from the sabotaging, focusing on the human and technolog-
ical factors that interplay in both the design and musical
process.
We sought for participants who practiced music improvi-
sation and that were familiar with DIY/ maker processes
(see Table 1). We contacted participants directly by email.
All participants belonged to the Centre for Digital Music
Research Centre at Queen Mary University of London
3.1 Preparation of projects
Two weeks before the workshop, we asked participants to fill
in a design proposal for their self-sabotaging instruments.
In the submission form we first explained what we under-
stood by “self-sabotage” and gave some general guidance on
how to think about the proposed design (see appendix A
with the full form template). We asked them to briefly de-
scribe their proposed designs and include the materials they
thought they would need. We asked them to work with their
most familiar instrument used in their improvisation prac-
tice (Table 1).
3.2 Structure of the workshop
The workshop was held in the Centre for Digital Music in
Queen Mary University of London and it was approved by
the Ethics Committee of Queen Mary University of London.
Participants signed a consent form for recording each part
of the session and to publish it in a non-anonymous way, if
necessary. Participants brought their own musical instru-
ments. We asked them to bring the instrument they felt
most comfortable with for improvising. They were given 5
hours to build their sabotaging device. We provided the
materials required by participants (e.g. embedded hard-
ware like Bela platform [23], electronic components, foam,
acrylic, crafting and library materials, among others) plus
extra materials that could lead to a more material-oriented
practice [29] - we were open to the projects being modified
by ideas in situ . After this, each participant was asked to
give a short demonstration explaining their initial idea and
how the building process unfolded, and to finish with a short
performance with their sabotaged instrument (no more than
5 minutes) . We purposely restricted participants to a short
amount of rehearsal time in order to foster the appearance
of struggling and coping strategies during the performances,
and to avoid them “hiding” the sabotaging element through
practice. Finally, the group gathered for a 40-minute focus
group where we asked them questions regarding their ex-
perience of building and using the sabotaging instrument,
focusing on the level of control of the instrument and the
strategies they developed to cope with it.
4. SELF-SABOTAGING INSTRUMENTS
Here we will describe the design process and the result-
ing sabotaging instrument for each participant, followed
by a short description of their performances. Videos of
the demonstrations (i.e. explanations + performances) are
available from the workshop’s website 1.

4.1 Random Cross-Fader by Jacob
Jacob brought his bass guitar, different effect pedals and
his laptop for working with Pure Data [27]. His initial idea
was to modify the pitch or timing of what was being played
in the bass through a combination of software and effect
pedals. However, as he said “then I realized that I had
these really shh.....bad...pedals [laughs]”. Jacob leveraged
the “gnarly” nature of the pedals as a good source of self-
sabotage. Then, he designed a cross-fader to combine the
crunchy messy pedals with some other “nicer” pedals. The
weight that was given to each of the two families of pedals
was randomly allocated anytime the space bar of the laptop
was pressed (see Figure 1). Jacob invited the audience - i.e.
participants of the workshop - to press it whenever they
wanted to, as a way of not having control over it.
Before starting the performance, Jacob noticed that there
was a background noise he couldn’t get rid of, even if using
the “clean” pedals. In a jokingly way he commented that
this is not important as having the broken pedals “it’s going
to sound horrible anyways”.
During the performance, Jacob played long notes with
the bass and he focused on fine tuning the sound through
the pedals’ knobs. The audience started interacting by sin-
gle pressing the space bar, getting abrupt changes on the
timbre and Jacob reacting to that through changing of bass
fingering and knob tuning. Almost at the end of the perfor-
mance, Juan approached the laptop and, instead of tapping
the space bar, he grabbed the mouse pointer and directly
manipulated the slider that controls the cross-fader, obtain-
ing a smooth change of the sound - in contrast to Jacob’s
planned random jumps. Similarly, Andrea approached and
started to quickly and continuously press the space bar.
This led to the use of the space bar as an extra sound ef-
fect. Jacob positively engaged with this, nodding with his
head and making eye contact with Andrea.
Figure 1: A Pure Data patch invited audience to randomize
the parameters when pressing the space bar.
4.2 The Distant Cello by Nicole
Nicole is a classically trained cellist and multi-instrumentalist,
and an experienced music performer. From Nicole’s design
proposal for the workshop:
I have the feeling that while improvising (or more
specifically, when I am not reading music), I am
more aware of the close connection of my body
to the cello. My idea for a self-sabotaging device
is quite simple - to disrupt/ break my bodily rela-
tionship with the instrument. I would place spe-
cially shaped objects in the the contact points be-
tween my body and the instrument (neck, chest,
knees).
She designed and built three foam pieces, one for the neck
part and two for the knees (see Figure 2). Besides disrupting
her connection with the cello, Nicole realized an unforeseen
sabotaging factor: the neck piece would difficult the posi-
tioning of her left hand, as it would preclude the thumb

touching the back of the cello’s neck, which usually helps
Nicole in terms of grounding and to “know where I am in
terms of pitch”. Nicole said she felt the cello “very weird”
and “uncomfortable”. She found her left hand especially un-
reliable as, in contrast to what she is used to, she had to
think about the pitches that would be produced, and her
hand would inevitably try to use the thumb as a pivot point.
Figure 2: Foam shapes were created in order to detach the
body from the cello thus losing the usual bodily connection
and feedback processes.
During her performance, Nicole would relentlessly stop
and comment on the difficulty she was having to get a
proper sound from the cello. Her attitude - continuous
laughter interspersed with sighs and puffs - shed light on
her not engaging with the instrument (something she ex-
plicitly said at the end of the performance). Her attempts
of making music narrowed down to simple diatonic scales
and basic exercises, trying mostly to use the upper regis-
ter of the cello, where Nicole commented it was easier to
play because of the thumb not being blocked. Nicole said
to feel a big lack of confidence with the instrument, and she
jokingly ended the performance saying “can I take this out
now, please?”.
4.3 Drunken Attack by Andrea
Andrea is an experienced jazz acoustic/electric guitar player.
In his proposal he refers to unintentional delay as the musi-
cian’s nightmare, especially in the context of big bands. As
he pointed out:
The inspiration came from the pain I felt play-
ing for the first time after a long while in a big
band. Missed or sloppy attacks really do stand
out there, and you’re usually incinerated by the
MD Whiplash-style once you haven’t been on point
a few times.
Andrea designed and developed a script in Bela [23] - see
Figure 3 - that through short-term averaging of the gui-
tar signal would detect attacks and then assign to the out-
put signal’s attacks a delay of random length (changing for
every new attack). The result, as Andrea commented in
the demonstration, was quite frustrating for him. For each
attack one could hear a loud (and not planned) glitching
sound, which was very upsetting for him. Besides, Andrea
was unsure whether the obtained result was exactly what
he wanted. In particular, he said that the randomness of
the delay didn’t sound like such. Instead, he felt that it was
happening in certain fixed values.
Figure 3: A Bela script adds random delay to each attack.
Andrea’s performance was similar to Nicole’s in the way
that it was more a technical demonstration. Andrea de-
cided to explore how the Drunken Attack would work when
playing different styles: trying long chords, rapid riffs and
scales, adding distortion, and using the vibrato bar. At the
end he got into an even more experimental and he repeat-
edly played the same chord in a way of elucidating if the
same action was leading to different (random) values for
the delays or not.
4.4 The Moving Knob by Juan
Juan used a stepper motor for randomly move the volume
knob of the electric guitar (see Figure 4 left side), so he
would be constantly bothered by abrupt changes of volume
(or even muting). However, an unforeseen thing happened:
just before the performance the stepper motor failed. To
compensate for this and to show a very basic idea of the de-
vice, he improvised a “Wizard of Oz” prototype [21] where
one person would move the knob to try to replicate a ran-
dom pattern whilst Juan was playing.
Juan started his performance by trying quick jazz arpeg-
gios and scales. He was observed looking at how the knob
was moving to try to adapt to it, but as soon as the knob
would move to lower values most of the rapidly changing
notes were completely muted. At some point Juan made a
short pause and then he started playing long chords. As
soon as this happened, he nodded in a kind of eureka!
moment, while he commented: “this is a nice tremolo!”.
Figure 4: A stepper motor was supposed to randomly move
the volume knob. As the mechanism broke for the perfor-
mance, we used the Wizzard of Oz technique, with a human
replacing the stepper motor.
Thenceforth, Juan kept long notes, interspersing chords with
single strings plucks and arpeggios. The performance ended
unexpectedly due to a final unforeseen element: the belt
used for moving the knob came out and Juan is forced to
end his performance.
5. FOCUS GROUP
5.1 Control and the role of randomness
When asked about the importance of keeping the control
of their instruments, all four participants agreed that some
control can be given away as long as they keep their abil-
ity to make something musical. Andrea commented that
even in cases of substantial losing of control - like the one
he experienced - you can still keep some musicality by, for
instance, “drowning the sound in effects”, to which Jacob
added that this was precisely what he did with his Random
Cross-Fader. Nicole said that with her sabotaged cello she
felt a broken relationship and a complete inability to make
music with it. She felt “a lack of control, but is not that
this control was being taken by anything else”.
At this point the conversation turned into discussing the
role of randomness, a factor included for all the instruments
excepting Nicole’s.
Jacob started commenting about his combination of ran-
domness with audience control:
I thought it was cool, I really enjoyed it...you can
get really really self absorbed and is quite nice to
have somebody just come and say ‘do something
different now’.
Juan commented that this was also engaging for the au-
dience:
I remember me changing stuff and you stopping
what you were about to do, so it was very inter-
active.
The inclusion of randomness for Andrea’s Drunken At-
tack was quite contrasting with Jacob’s case. He said:
Randomness didn’t functionally mattered in my
case. In the situation itself you don’t really feel
the randomness, because what you feel is a glitch.
Finally, Juan commented that for his Moving Knob the
effective result of randomness was a simple effect, a tremolo,
that allowed him to adapt and respond to it, which made it
engaging and fun for him. He ended up saying:
When you have a random element and then you
want to adapt to that...that’s when the creative
stuff happens.
5.2 Coping with the sabotaging
When asked about their strategies to cope with their sabo-
taged instruments, the following strategies were described:
5.2.1 Ignore
As can be seen in the first part of Andrea’s demonstra-
tion video, he tries to play chords progressions or riffs com-
pletely as if the intrusion wouldn’t exist. By ignoring the
audio feedback, Andrea forgets about the musical output
and focus on controlling the instrument as usual. As he
commented:
I am a very bad musician when it comes to adapt-
ing to things, I tend to be incredibly stubborn, so
one alternative for me was to play in the play-
what-I-know mode, pretending that the thing [sab-
otaging element] isn’t there.
5.2.2 Musical adaptation
Nicole noted that her Distant Cello entailed physical con-
straints which at the same time imply musical suggestions
on how to play the cello. The improviser can then react,
adapt and use these suggestions as a creative material.
For example, I would be more tempted to play in
the upper parts [higher pitch range] of the cello
as they are not obstructed.
Juan complemented that for his Moving Knob this was also
the case:
The timbral space that I was presented by the
effect made me adapt to it and use specific tech-
niques that would work with it.
5.2.3 Compensation
Andrea contrasted the musical adaptation strategy to a
more rational endeavour: to study, understand the function-
ing of the instrument, and then develop techniques accord-
ingly to compensate the sabotaging factor. Andrea empha-
sised the difference between this and musical adaptations,
as the former
...it is not a musical endeavour, but an exper-
imental endeavour. I just wanted to hear and
understand what happened
5.2.4 Drowning it in effects
Juan, referring to Andrea’s Drunken Attack, put the ques-
tion about the limits of the human capabilities to compen-
sate or adapt to intrusions that are too difficult or chaotic to
anticipate. Andrea responded with the strategy of drowning
it in effects:
Well, in that case, you can always drown it in ef-
fects. I tried to do that but the glitch was making
it worse.
6. DISCUSSION
As an exploratory workshop we want to start a wider discus-
sion about self-sabotaging as a design practice, rather than
aiming to generalize our findings into design ideas. More-
over, it is important to see how self-sabotaging overlaps -
and also differs - with NIME-related practices and values
such as “Bent by Design” [16], control and agency shift [5],
ambiguity [35], and surprise [30], among others.
In order to do so, we structure our discussion into the
three stages of the workshop: the planning, the implemen-
tation and the musicking [34].
6.1 Planning: Self-Sabotaging as setting of
boundaries
When our participants planned their specific sabotaging
ideas, we note deep aesthetic values and identities coming
into play: Andrea’s struggling with note timing in a big
band, Nicole’s bodily relationship with her cello; Jacob’s
focus on keeping musicality even when playing with faulty
equipment. This bringing of designers’ identities into their
designs has already been pointed out within the NIME (and
broader design) contexts [6, 19]. However, self-sabotaging
goes somewhat further as it calls for an overt breaking of
(some of) these values. This implies the dissolving of aes-
thetic boundaries or drawing of new ones. For instance,
Jacob’s main plan was to include new musicalities (i.e. the
crunchy pedals) that he wouldn’t allow himself to include
in a formal performance. Andrea’s case is similar: he would
try something that, by definition, would be his nemesis in a
big band concert. As we can see, the self-Sabotaging plan
is opening not only for developing new instruments, but
also to imagine new scenarios and contexts. Of course in-
tention is crucial here. Self-sabotaging means an intention
of walking towards struggling points, but at the same time
without failing or making the fool of ourselves (unless this
is the intention!). This contrast between failed and success-
ful self-sabotaging resembles Bertinetto’s contrast between
mistakes and novelty [1]. A mistake, says Bertinetto, is the
breaking of a specific aesthetic normative without helping
to propose new normative conditions. If we, instead, break
a norm with an intention or proposition of a new norm, then
this can lead to novelty or creativity, rather than just a mis-
take. Self-sabotaging does not mean to break the performer-
instrument relationship. Rather, the aim is to intentionally
intrude on this relationship to allow for the exploration of
new boundaries.
6.2 Implementing: Self-Sabotaging as a net-
work of human-material factors
Each one of the resulting instruments, as summarised in
Table 2, is not only one but a combination of several “sab-
otaging factors” - elements that appear to intrude the pre-
viously familiar relationship. Let’s take Jacob’s example.
First, there’s the broken pedals. For Jacob, the pedals are
a sabotaging factor because they bring forth“gnarly”sounds
and timbres. Secondly, there is the inclusion of a random
function that picks a combination of the nice and broken
pedals. This is a sabotaging factor for a different reason:
it takes out control from Jacob over which specific sounds
he will get. Thirdly, Jacob allows the audience to tap and
change the sounds, therefore sabotaging the control of when
the sound will change.
This entangled character of sabotaging factors emphasises
the fact that the function, value and meaning of a specific
sabotaging factor is nothing per se, but it only gets meaning
by how it is embedded within this network. Randomness,
for instance, accomplished very different functions in the
three cases it was used, as described in section 5.1.
6.3 Musicking: Self-Sabotaging as a planned
openness to the unplanned
In contrast to randomness and other planned sabotaging
factors, when playing the instruments, several unplanned
factors came into play (see Table 2 fourth column). The
effect of each one was quite different. For example, Juan
grabbing the mouse instead of using the space bar was pos-
itively received and reported as engaging for Jacob. On the
other hand, Andrea’s glitch or Nicole’s precluded thumb
were frustrating as these sabotaging factors overshadowed
the rest, making it impossible to use any of the strategies
described in section 5.2.
This stage brings forth again the intention, but now in a
different way. The key point is how to musically make sense
of the resulting self-sabotaging instrument, either if it is
slightly hindered or completely broken. The self-sabotaging
practitioner is called to leverage both performer and de-
signer skills to use the planned (intended) sabotaging fac-
tors, but also to cope or even embrace the unplanned ones as
raw materials. Although the strategies described in section
5.2 were mostly musical responses, we can consider extend-
ing towards design strategies. For example, drowning in
effects could be seen as a design strategy whenever control-
ling the instrument gets humanly impossible, as noted by
Andrea.
6.4 Future perspectives for self-sabotaging
As a final point, we borrow Andrea’s final assertion regard-
ing his need of more time to build a relationship with the
self-sabotaging instrument:
I see sabotaging as a continuous process with us
trying to overcome the problems we put to our-
selves.
The rapid prototyping character of our workshop hin-
dered the possibilities of any further iterations. We fore-
see that through new iterations self-sabotaging practition-
ers could seek a balance between disruption and familiarity,
something akin to what Mudd et al refer as edge-like inter-
actions for the particular case of control [30]. For example,
as a speculation, we imagine two modifications or extensions
to the cases of our workshop that could help to achieve this
balance through the paradoxical idea of a “controlled intru-
sion”. For instance:
• For Nicole: Instead of fixed foam pieces for the cello,
pieces that change their shape, so performers could
move from an “infinitesimal intrusion” and slightly
make them grow to more disruptive intrusions.
• For Andrea: A random delay with a maximum value
of t milliseconds, where t can be controlled by an ex-
pression pedal. In this way, a guitar player can start
with no delay and then slightly and continuously in-
crease the value of t through the pedal, so they are
able to familiarize (at least partially, because it will
always have randomness) to this increasing intrusion.

7. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we reported the results of our Self-Sabotage
Workshop, where 4 NIME practitioners modified their in-
struments in order to intrude on their usual practice. Re-
flecting on the instruments and the focus group results, we
drew a line between self-sabotage and other NIME-related
concepts as randomness, lose of control and failure. Firstly,
we distinguish self-sabotaging as an intention, a design prac-
tice that queries the practitioner about their aesthetic bound-
aries and values. What to break and how to break varies
abruptly between each practitioner. Secondly, self-sabotage
implies an encounter between the planned and the unplanned.
The planned part refers to the original design: random func-
tions, material obstructions, an intentional delay. The un-
planned part regards the material response when musick-
ing: gestures that become difficult or impossible, unplanned
glitches or bugs in the code, among others.
We suggest that a successful self-sabotaging practice must
entail (i) For the planned part, a skillful design process that
aims to find the balance between familiarity and instrusion
for that particular music practitioner (i.e. themselves). (ii)
For the unplanned part, we need a skillful musician that
can develop strategies (e.g. compensation, adaptations, or
even ignoring) to cope with the unplanned factors, so that
they are able to retain musicality. We speculate that more
iterations should be offered to find a balance between the
design challenges and the musicians’ skills.

APPENDIX
A. WORKSHOP STRUCTURE
The following is the invitation and guidance text provided
to the designers.
• Workshop Date: 11 December 2021, 10:00-15:00
• Location: Queen Mary, University of London
• Description: in this workshop we will explore what hap-
pens when we try to self-sabotage our music perfor-
mances, and what this can bring of new in the context
of music improvisation. We will collaborate to design
and build artifacts that will be embedded in your usual
individual improvisation practice, and explore what new
kinds of interactions they can bring. We invite ALL
KINDS of music improvisers: free impro, jazz impro,
electronic and DMI impro, experimental, live coding,
fusion, among others. The only requirement is that
you are familiar and comfortable with individual mu-
sic improvisation with your instrument.
• Proposal guideline: For your proposal, think of either
a physical artifact or an electronic device that you will
build in the workshop to use in your improvisation prac-
tice. This device has to be an intrusive element, some-
thing that is not only new but that also provoke some
dislocation, disturbance in your practice. Obviously, it
doesn’t have to be too disruptive that precludes your
performance. Think of a tiny disturbance, something
that may take you out of your usual interaction with
the instrument. To give you some ideas, notice that
you can mainly go two paths:
1. To modify the gesture/physical space: this includes
modification of size, weights, shape of any of the
elements you use (bow, hands, picks, sticks, etc).
Yo can also add new degrees of freedom, like ro-
tations, translation or vibration of elements. Also
you can constraint the physical interaction (for ex-
ample, tying up fingers, adding stiffness or physical
effort to specific movements, blocking some parts of
the instrument).
2. To modify the mapping of sounds: As we get fa-
miliar with our instrument, we naturalize the map-
ping of a specific gesture to a specific sound. What
happens when this connection is broken? The most
basic example of this is when we try an unfamiliar
new tuning in a string instrument. For digital in-
struments this brings special opportunities, as we
can remap (through MIDI or OSC protocols) the
gesture sound relationship as we like. Some ideas
could be to add random values to the output notes,
or remapping some specific keys of a MIDI con-
troller, but the possibilities are infinite!
