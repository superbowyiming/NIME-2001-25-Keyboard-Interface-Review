Mr. Buchla presented and showed some of the fascinating musical instruments that he has 
created since 1965.  We were privileged to ha ve the actual instruments available to see 
and hear on loan courtesy of Don Buchla, David Kean and the Audities Foundation.  The 
instruments that were shown include: 
 
Thunder (1990) 
The first of my MIDI controllers, soon to be  reincarnated.  Its about 18” wide x 12" deep 
and mounts on a 3 foot tripod. 
 
Wind  (1994) 
One of several programming disasters, this is  about as far as it ev er got. Its roughly 18" 
square, and can be wall mounted. 
 
Lightning II (1996) 
Still in production and going strong.  Spectators can play this one. The business end is 6" 
x 8" and is mounted on a 4 foot tripod. 
 
Marimba Lumina (2000) 
About 5 of these gold editions were assemble d.  But lots of its cousins, the Marimba 
Lumina 3.5 and 2.5 were built and marketed by N earfield Systems.  This instrument is 
about 8 feet wide by about 2 f eet deep, and is m ounted on a 3 1/2 foot high keyboard 
stand.  Joel Davel will demonstate occasionally. 
 
200e (2004) 
The latest synth, this is esse ntially a re-introduction of th e 200 series, but with several 
advanced facilities.  It is an excellent ex ample of the knobs and wi res approach to user 
interface.  Spectators can play it.  Its about 30" wide by 18" deep and is table mounted. 
 
400 (1982) 
This pre-MIDI synth sports an advanced video display, and is still in use. Its 24" wide by 
18" deep and is table mounted. It will be occasionally demonstrated. 
 
Sili con cello (ca.1975) 
This is the Sili side of a Cello and el ectronics piece composed for cellist Ami 
Radunskaya.  It has been retuned to work with  the voice and offers audience interaction.  
Its about 24" by 18" and is hung on a wall. 
 
Magic flute (1965) 
Reflecting the 60's culture, this is a unique user interface.  It is about 4 feet wide by a foot 
high, and can be hung on a wall.
