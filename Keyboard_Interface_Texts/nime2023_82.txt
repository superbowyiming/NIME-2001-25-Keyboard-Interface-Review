ABSTRACT
In this paper we present the Sabotaging Piano, a prepared
electronic piano that alters key-to-pitch correspondence by
reassigning adjacent pitches (i.e. one semi-tone higher or
lower) to each key. Performers can control how many keys
to remap through an expression pedal. If the pedal is not
pressed the Sabotaging Piano works as a normal piano.
When fully pressed, each key is remapped one semi-tone
up or down with equal probability. Each new performance
(i.e. when the piano is turned on) triggers a new and un-
known remapping pattern, but the specific pattern remains
fixed throughout the whole performance. This aims to pro-
vide a balance of uncertain but still explorable and learnable
behaviour.
We invited three professional piano improvisers to re-
hearse with our piano in order to prepare a final improvi-
sation concert. Through analysis of rehearsals’ reports and
the MIDI data collected in the final concert, here we show
that the three pianists not only developed different tech-
niques with the Sabotaging Piano, but they also leveraged
the particularities of it to use them as creative resources.

1. INTRODUCTION
Within NIME contexts, losing or sharing control with the
instrument is a well established practice - to the point that
Morreale et al [11] identify the redistribution of agencies as
a foundational feature of NIME performers’ identity.
However, we note that shared agency can emerge mainly
in two ways. A first path is when control is not an intended
goal since the inception of the instrument. This is precisely

the case for several NIME examples (e.g. [9, 3, 16]), where
performers “can develop advanced performance skills with
the instrument, but not in the virtuoso sense of highly spec-
ified and predictable control” [11].
A second path is when the performer develops a high
level of control through exhaustive practice, and then they
intentionally give away some control as a way of unlearn re-
hearsed patterns [6]. We relate this path to well-established
music improvisation practices like jazz (especially free jazz)
and free improvisation, where highly virtuoso performers
emphasise the breaking of usual patterns end the use of
mistakes as a source of creativity [14, 10, 13, 5] - as the old
jazz adage says, “it is not a mistake if you play it twice” [1].
De Souza [6] documents several cases of what he defines as
“voluntary self-sabotage”, where virtuoso performers retune,
redesign or intervene their instruments in order to unlearn
them and therefore explore new creative possibilities.
Despite being a praised strategy within these virtuoso
circles, we do not find further references on how these new
techniques appear and what is the general adoption process
when musicians are faced to sabotaging factors. The related
literature revolves either around pedagogic techniques for
beginner improvisers [8, 4] or around anecdotal - and some-
times legendary - stories about masters of jazz and impro-
visation[1, 7, 2].
In order to explore this adoption process we present the
Sabotaging Piano, an electronic (MIDI) prepared piano that
remaps keys into unexpected pitches. Through an expres-
sion pedal performers decide the amount of keys to be
remapped, thus allowing them to continuously move from a
non-modified piano (pedal not pressed), to a fully remapped
one. We asked three professional pianists to rehearse with
the piano and prepare an improvisation concert with it. We
asked them to document their rehearsal process to shed
light into their adoption process and the techniques they
might develop for this particular instrument. We present
the preliminary results of the improvisation concert where
we recorded MIDI data of both the pedal and keys pressing
in order to contrast with the rehearsals reports.
2. THE SABOTAGING PIANO
In this section we detail the mechanism of the Sabotaging
Piano.
For easier explanation, we define F(i) as the mapping
function that takes each key i (i = 0, ..,127) from the piano
and maps it to a corresponding pitch. In a common piano,
pitches would match the keys, so we would have F(i) = i
(this is simply to say that in a piano, if we press the key
denoted as C4, we will then hear the note C4, or to put
it in our terms, F(C4) = C4). For our modified piano, we
propose the following mapping function:
p = 0 
 p = 0.2 
 p = 1 
 p = 0.2 
p = 0 
 p = 0.2 
 p = 1 
 p = 0.2 
Session 1 Session 2 
Figure 1: Example interaction with the Sabotaging Piano for two different sessions (performances). Each session is defined
since the piano is turned on and until it is turned off, as this is when the remapping patterns change. Blue and red keys denote
remapping of one semitone up or down, respectively. The remapping pattern is fixed for a whole session. However, the specific
keys to be remapped are defined by the level of pressing of the pedal p.
F(i) =



i + 1 with probability p
2
i − 1 with probability p
2
i with probability (1 − p)
(1)
where pianists can control the value of p (with 0 ≤ p ≤ 1)
through an expression pedal. In this way, when the expres-
sion pedal is not pressed, then the Sabotaging Piano works
as an usual piano ( F(i) = i), and when it is fully pressed,
each key will deviate by one semitone, either up or down
with the same probability. For intermediate values of p, a
proportion p of keys will deviate by one semitone and the
rest (1 − p) will work as usual. Although randomly gen-
erated, the remapping pattern stays fixed within a whole
performance. This means that for a specific value of p, the
same remapping pattern will be obtained, so performers can
leave the pedal in a fixed position and explore the particu-
lar remapping that is given there. Each time the piano is
reset, though, this remapping pattern will change - refer to
Figure 1 for an illustrated explanatory example.
The idea of this mechanism is to follow Mudd’s idea of
something that is at the same time unpredictable but learn-
able [12]. The resulting pitches are unexpected at first but
remain fixed throughout the performance, so musicians are
invited to explore the specific remapping and learn from it
during their playing. Still, by changing the mapping for the
next performance, we avoid performers completely assim-
ilating the specific pattern, thus inviting them to explore
and learn a new one. Then, performers can practice with
the piano to have an idea of its working and to develop in-
teraction strategies, but they will never know exactly what
will they confront in the next performance.
3. METHODS
3.1 Participants
We invited three professional piano improvisers to try out
the Sabotaging Piano. We wanted to know how would they
use - if used at all - the pedal in a real performance context
(including the rehearsal process) and what is the perform-
ers’ experience with the Sabotaging Piano. We looked for
improvisers whose styles used to some extent tonality as we
wanted the remapping to be intrusive (for styles like free
improvisation or free jazz where tonality might be disre-
garded, the sabotaging character of our piano might not be
that evident).
We gave pianists a period of 1.5 months to rehearse with
the Sabotaging Piano to prepare a final improvisation live
concert, to be held in the 11th International Workshop on
Haptic & Audio Interaction Design [15]. We asked them
to prepare a ∼30 minutes improvisation for the concert,
without asking any particular style or structure. The three
pianists have professional formation on piano and had ex-
perience with piano improvisation. A brief description of
pianists is shown in Table 1

3.2 Data collection
We used different data collection methods for assessing the
performers experiences with the Sabotaging Piano.
3.2.1 Pedal and MIDI keys data:
Both expression pedal and key pressing temporal patterns
can be easily collected. For the key presses, information of
the onset of each note and also the velocity and duration
of them is directly collected in MIDI format. We collected
data for both the rehearsals and final concert. For this work,
we are only using the final concert MIDI data.
Figure 2: Evolution of pedal pressing during the final concert for each one of the three performers.
3.2.2 Rehearsal reports:
We asked each performer that after each rehearsal session
they send us an audio or written note describing what they
did, what they tried, anything new that they noticed, and
strategies or techniques that they had developed with the
piano.
4. RESULTS
Although further quantitative and qualitative analysis are
needed for having a broad picture, here we show the first
results emerging from the raw data. We will focus our re-
sults and discussions around the strategies that performers
developed both in the rehearsals and final concert.
Videos of the final concert are available in the project
website 1 .
4.1 Different uses of the pedal
From Figure 2 we can find marked differences in how each
performer used the pedal. In particular we notice that P1
(upper panel) used the pedal by smoothly changing values
and keeping fixed values for a while. Instead, P2 and P3
(second and third panel) used the pedal in an all-on all-off
way. The smooth and structured movement of the pedal of
P1 can also be seen in their rehearsals. In their notes for
the second rehearsal we can find a written structure of the
pedal pattern:
“Today I did:
No alteration
50% alternation
No alteration
100% alteration
No alteration”
4.2 One-note trill
The particular structure of the remapping produces what
we have called a one-note trill . This happens when two
adjacent keys are mapped to the same pitch - for example
F(C4) = B3 and F(B3) = B3. The particularity of this
mapping is that allows to create an effect of trill with one
note. The performer rapidly plays both keys interspersed,
but as both have the same pitch, it sounds as they are play-
ing only one key with an apparent extremely high speed.
This technique was discovered and reported by the three
performers. P3 used it repeatedly during the concert. One
can listen that they“look”for the trill by going up and down

the keyboard until they found a pair of kays that has the
particular remapping combination.
Figure 3: Histogram of key pressings for P1. The marked
high frequency of D, A denote a key of D. The low frequency
of F suggests the key of D major.
Figure 4: Histogram of resulting pitches for P1. The fre-
quencies are less marked here than in figure 3 as the tonality
is inevitably lost when adding a random factor
4.3 Pedal as source of tension
The quick pressing and unpressing of the pedal used by P2
and P3 and referred in section 4.1 was fundamented as a
source of tension for the performance. As P2 says in one of
their rehearsals recording:
“I found that fully pressing the pedal was a
good source of tension. For example, I tend
to keep simple repeated arpeggios, starting with
no pedal pressing. Then, suddenly pressing the
pedal in full adds full tension to the arpeggio
that waits for a resolution. Then I simply get
back to the unmodified arpeggio and it resolves
naturally.”
This strategy was also described by P3. In both cases,
they showed a complete openness to whatever the pedal
would bring. This contrasts with P1 strategy, who aimed to
explore and understand which specific notes were remapped
in order to consciously use them:
“Specially in the lower levels of alteration, what
happened is that, since I knew there would be
some alterations although I couldn’t always per-
ceive it, many times I was actually trying to find
the key which had the tuning altered. And of
course this ‘search’ took a certain shape within
the improvisation.”
4.4 Grounding through octaves and fifths
P1 showed a particular strategy that can be clearly noticed
several times in the performance. These moments corre-
sponded to short pauses followed by the following sequence
of notes: D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 or some variation of it. This
moments happened specifically whenever P1 had changed
the level of the pedal. Also, from the frequency histogram
of key pressing (Figure 3 we can notice that the piece was
clearly being played in tonal mode, in this case, in a D
major scale. Through playing the tonic keys P1 is actu-
ally prompting, exploring to see whether they are being
remapped or not, for each value of the pedal. This is cor-
roborated again in their rehearsal notes:
“I decided to base my improvisation in intervals
of 5ths and octaves, aiming that, together with
the constant return to the the original piano tun-
ing, it could help to perceive the alterations.”
5. FUTURE WORK
As described above, we have discovered preliminary strate-
gies that performers have used to cope with the sabotaging
piano, but also new techniques that have emerged from the
sabotaging.
More thorough analyses are needed to have a complete
picture of how and in which ways the Sabotaging Piano is
modifying the interaction and what can this bring of new
in the creative realm. In particular, future analysis may
concern how the pressing of the pedal is making - or not
- performers to neglect tonal rules. This is suggested by
the discussion given in section 4.3. Of course, the use of
pedal always leads to a loss of tonal structure, as it can be
appreciated by comparing the pressed keys histogram (Fig-
ure 3) with the resulting pitches histogram (Figure 4). The
important question, however, is whether the keys pressing
pattern changes depending of the pressing level of the pedal.
Are performers playing more tonally when the pedal is not
pressed? Our future analysis, then, entails obtaining dis-
tribution of key presses (similar to figures above) but now
depending on the level of pressing of the pedal.
6. CONCLUSIONS
In this work-in-progress paper, we present the Sabotaging
Piano, an electronic prepared piano that remaps the keys
depending on the level of pressing of an expression pedal.
We also show the preliminary results of three pianists us-
ing the Sabotaging Piano. Through documented rehearsals
and a final improvisation concert, we grasped some initial
ideas of the strategies that might emerge when coping with
the piano. We propose that these strategies are not only
a response to compensate, but they can lead to new ex-
ploratory and creative behaviour.
