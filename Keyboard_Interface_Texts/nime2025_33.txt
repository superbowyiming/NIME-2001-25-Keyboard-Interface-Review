Abstract
We present a novel computer application for real-time exploration
of microtonal harmonies through intuitive visualization and inte-
grated MIDI controllers, bridging theoretical concepts and practi-
cal musical applications. We extend modern harmonic principles
from 12-tone equal temperament (12-TET), incorporating inter-
val distinctions from 31-TET (subminor, neutral, supermajor),
and further expanding into detailed harmonic possibilities of
53-tone equal temperament (53-TET). Our application leverages
modal interchange and parallel chord substitutions, offering intu-
itive navigation through microtonal harmonic trajectories. The
implementation utilizes MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) via
our custom MaxForLive application, The Bridge , ensuring precise
microtonal control and compatibility with digital audio worksta-
tions (Ableton Live 11/12 ). The system includes real-time visualiza-
tion, interactive chord manipulation, and a comprehensive Scale
Editor for harmonic experimentation. Through practical exam-
ples and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate how this approach
reveals new harmonic possibilities while maintaining connec-
tions to established modal frameworks. This research contributes
to the growing microtonal music field by providing theoretical
foundations and practical tools that incorporate extended tuning
systems into contemporary musical practice.

1 Introduction
Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) such asAbleton Live have
made strides in incorporating microtonality, allowing users to
experiment with extended tuning systems through features like
piano rolls with microtonal pitch adjustments. However, these
implementations are constrained by the limitations of the MIDI
protocol, which was designed for the 12-tone equal temperament
(12-TET) system. Microtonal tuning in such environments of-
ten requires compromises, such as reducing the available pitch
range when distributing the MIDI range into more detailed pitch
distributions per octave.
Although extensive theoretical frameworks for microtonality
exist [4, 12, 13, 25]—and microtonal practices have been embraced
by composers and instrument makers around the world—the po-
tential of microtonal chord progressions, particularly the nuanced
spectrum of chord qualities and their functional relationships,
has not been fully exploited in digital musical interfaces. In many

traditional and contemporary musical contexts, microtonality
is a common feature; however, the specific domain of extended
chord quality variations within microtonal systems offers a richer
palette of harmonic textures that challenge conventional tonal
relationships. Existing tools in DAWs often lack the intuitive in-
terfaces and computational support necessary for composers and
performers to explore and manipulate these subtle yet expressive
harmonic possibilities in real time.
This paper presents a computer application for real-time mi-
crotonal harmony exploration. The system comprises an inter-
active interface with an 8x8 grid for composing chord progres-
sions, scale, chord editions, and a voicing editor. This interface is
controllable through a MIDI controller (launchpad MK[3]). Un-
like traditional fixed-template approaches, this project enables
users to experiment with harmonic relationships by applying
modern concepts like modal interchanges and parallel chord
substitutions to microtonal contexts. This design philosophy al-
lows musicians to discover new harmonic possibilities from a
clear theoretical framework. Supplemental material, audio exam-
ples, and the application are available on the project’s web page.

2 Literature Review
We first survey work related to the computational modeling of
music and cultural practices of microtonality.
2.1 Computational Analysis of Harmony and
Tonal Structures
Computational analysis of harmony and tonal structures is in-
formed by advances in both cognitive and neo-Riemannian ap-
proaches. Balzano [6] frames harmonic structures using cyclic
groups, enabling intuitive explorations of 12-tone and micro-
tonal systems. The Harmony Space interface [1], introduced by
Holland (1994) [17], is a pioneering interactive system for ex-
ploring and learning tonal harmony. Drawing on Balzano’s and
Longuet-Higgins’ theories, it employs a unique spatial metaphor
to make complex harmonic concepts accessible to novices while
providing advanced tools for experienced musicians.
Furthermore, as seen in chord complexes, topological struc-
tures extend this analysis by visualizing harmonic trajectories in
multi-dimensional spaces, providing deeper insights into the rela-
tionships between chords, particularly in modern music analysis
and classification tasks [8]. Chew [10] proposes a Spiral-Array
model representing tonal relationships through an interior-point
approach in three-dimensional space, where higher-level mu-
sical structures (chords, keys) are modeled as convex combina-
tions of lower-level components within a spiral derived from
the Harmonic Network (Tonnetz). This continuous representa-
tion, validated through geometric mappings to Lerdahl’s tonal
pitch space [ 20] and Krumhansl’s [ 19] experimental findings,
transforms traditionally combinatorial music analysis problems
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Dalmazzo et al.
into computationally efficient nearest-neighbor searches while
maintaining structural consistency with established music the-
ory. These approaches offer valuable insights into methods for
modeling, analyzing, and teaching harmony in computational
and educational contexts, concluding that exploring microtonal-
ity could open up new, untapped avenues for deeper harmonic
exploration.
2.2 Cultural Practices of Microtonal Music
Microtonal music has been implemented across diverse cultural
practices and artistic projects. Harry Partch’s pioneering work
with Greek scales led to his construction of 43-tone scale instru-
ments for his compositions [14]. Contemporary microtonal music
has found a significant platform through online platforms, with
dedicated content creators such as Hear Between The Lines [21],
Zheanna Erose [11], Mike Battaglia [7], and Maddie Ashman [5].
Award-winning musician Jacob Collier incorporates microtonal
chords into contemporary Western popular music. The growing
interest in microtonal music has influenced instrument develop-
ment, exemplified by the Lumatone [18]. While this instrument
represents an advancement in microtonal performance capabili-
ties, its high cost is a barrier for musicians and researchers. The
use of 53-TET extends beyond Western music, serving as the
standard tuning system in Turkish maqam music [29]. The xen-
harmonic [28] music movement, particularly within electronic
dance music, has fostered a community of artists exploring al-
ternative tuning systems, including notable contributions from
Elaine Walker, Birdhouse, and Stephen James Taylor [27].
2.3 Microtonality In Computer Music
Modeling
Anders and Miranda [4] developed a computational model for
microtonal music theory and composition using constraint pro-
gramming implemented in the now-discontinued Strasheela mu-
sic composition system [3]. This model supported various temper-
aments and allowed composers to define constraints for shaping
microtonal compositions across harmony, melody, and counter-
point, applying Western music theory concepts to microtonal
contexts. Chadwin [9] explored microtonality in popular music
and demonstrated that microtonal techniques can be effectively
integrated into contemporary songwriting across pop, rock, and
electronic genres, which expands the creative palette for song-
writers. Hirai et al. [15] introduced a microtonal music dataset of
100 music pieces with .wav and MIDI files with various tunings,
offering machine learning and MIR research support. These stud-
ies underscore the growing interest in microtonality and the need
for new theoretical frameworks and tools to explore microtonal
systems in modern music practice.
3 Musical Context and Notations in 53-TET
3.1 Why 53-TET?
The 53-tone equal temperament (53-TET) stands out for its close
approximation of intervals found in just intonation [23], a tuning
system in which simple whole-number ratios define intervals.
For example, the perfect fifth is the interval where the higher
note’s frequency is 3/2 that of the lower note, yielding a naturally
consonant sound. As noted by Holder [ 16], if the commas are
made equal, the octave can be divided into 5 whole tones and 2
diatonic semitones, with each step—known as a Holdrian Comma
(HC)—representing approximately 22.6415 cents [26]. Similarly,
Jing Fang (78–37 BCE) observed that stacking 53 perfect fifths
(each with the 3:2 ratio) nearly equals 31 octaves [ 22]. 53-TET
approximates both Pythagorean and just intonation intervals by
"tempering out" two small intervals: the schisma (32805/32768,
approximately 1.95 cents) and the kleisma (15625/15552, approxi-
mately 1.97 cents), effectively treating them as unison.
3.2 Equal Temperament Calculation
The methodology to calculate the tempered pitches employs an
information-based approach that extends modern harmony prin-
ciples into finer divisions, relying on mathematical precision to
develop the computational tool. The resolution of temperament
is achieved by identifying approximate common divisors of irra-
tional numbers that correspond to musical intervals, a process
referred to as antanáiresis [12]. This approach is mathemati-
cally expressed as: cents = 1200 ×log2 (ratio)Here, the octave is
divided into 1200 cents, with the perfect fifth represented by the
ratio 3 : 2, which calculates to: 701.9550008653874 cents. Differ-
ent tempered scales approximate this interval with varying levels
of precision. The successive approximations of their relation are
shown in Table 1. The 1200-cent quantization of the octave is
then multiplied by a ratio to establish the location of the fifth
interval. This table shows different ratios used to approximate the
perfect fifth in various temperaments. The 7:12 ratio represents
a slightly detuned fifth in 12-TET, while 31:53 demonstrates why
53-TET provides an excellent compromise between accuracy and
practical implementation with fewer than 100 divisions of the
octave.

ings.
3.3 Harmonic Exploration, Modes, and
Notations
The central concept of this work is to facilitate harmonic explo-
ration by focusing on modal logic and chord construction by
stacking thirds and using substitutions or alterations. Although
it is not a technical limitation, in this paper, we limit our scope
to heptatonic modes for simplicity of formalism and to maintain
clarity and accessibility when extending to 53-TET. We thus re-
tain the naming conventions of modes from modern Western
music theory.
While 53-TET contains the minor and major thirds of 12-TET,
it introduces other thirds that create new modal colors and chord
qualities. We can first consider 31-TET, in which appearsubmi-
nor, neutral, and supermajor thirds, adding gradations between
the usual minor and major thirds. 53-TET takes this gradation
even further by introducing more intervallic qualities, such as
downminor, neutral minor, or upmajor (respectively annotated
vm, ^^m, and ^M ). The complete list of interval qualities and their
notations is shown in Table 2.
Once a mode is established, chords can be constructed by stack-
ing thirds. Substitutions, alterations, and inversions can enrich

Figure 1: Scale distances defining the chord qualities
the harmonic possibilities and improve voice leading in chord
progressions. Because of the new chord qualities available in 53-
TET, we need to use a new notation to express the range of chord
quality. Figure 1 shows the different qualities and notations for
the different elements in a chord. The notation system for chords
follows the same syntax as jazz notation, where intervals are
explicitly indicated: the root is followed by the third quality, the
seventh, and then potential extension or alteration. For instance,
the chord with a root of vD, a neutral minor third, and a subminor
seventh, is annotated:
root: vD
third: neutral minor (n)
fifth: perfect
seventh: subminor (sm)


vDnsm7.
This notation format clearly expresses the chord content.
The new chord qualities provided by 53-TET significantly en-
rich harmonic possibilities. Even when keeping a perfect fifth,
100 possible combinations of the third and seventh exist, leading
to new harmonic colors. For example, starting from a dominant
chord featuring a major third and a minor seventh, modifying
the seventh towards a more neutral quality such asneutral minor
aligns the chord with the initial tones of the harmonic series.
This stabilization alters its conventional dominant functional
role expected in modern Western music theory. Hence, this trans-
formation of stable, subdominant, or dominant chords creates
more precise colors and new functional relations.
Figure 2: Example of modal interchanges in 12-TET
3.4 Modal Interchanges
Although harmonic exploration can be made through singular
modes, a compelling method for expanding research to other
chords is through modal interchanges. Modal interchange in-
volves borrowing chords from parallel or relative modes to in-
troduce new harmonic colors while maintaining a connection to
the original mode.
Parallel Interchange: This involves borrowing chords from a
mode sharing the same root as the original one. For instance, if
we are in C major/Ionian, we can borrow from C Aeolian.
Relative Interchange: This involves shifting to a mode where
the original root functions as a different degree of the scale and
borrowing chords from the obtained mode. For instance, start-
ing from C major/Ionian, an Aeolian relative modal interchange
would place C at the 6th degree of E♭ major/Ionian. Therefore,
we can borrow from E♭ major.
The distinction between parallel and relative modal inter-
changes appears more clearly when applied to chord progressions.
Figure 2 shows a simple “I vi ii V I” 12-TET progression in C
major, and the parallel and relative Aeolian interchanges for the
middle chords. The move from Ionian to Aeolian means adding
a ♭3 (E♭), ♭6 (A♭), and ♭7 (B♭). In the parallel interchange, the
chords are still based on the root of C. Am7 becomes A♭maj7 to
correspond to the new bag of notes of C Aeolian. Similarly, we
obtain Dm7♭5 and Gm7. In the relative interchange, the chords
are now based on the root of E ♭. The vi is, therefore, the 6th
degree of E♭ major, ie. Cm7. Similarly, we obtain Fm7 and B♭7.
This concept of modal interchanges can be directly applied
to the extended modal possibilities of 53-TET. Once a mode is
defined, parallel and relative motion can borrow new chords and
harmonic content into a progression. This approach is at the core
of harmonic exploration in our application.
4 Software Design
The software design is a two-tier system. It begins with The
Bridge, a MaxForLive [2] patch programmed in Max 8 (version
8.6.5) that connects the application to MIDI by translating 53-TET
note coordinates into a 12-TET piano roll. MIDI polyphonic ex-
pression (MPE) [24] adjusts intermediate pitches precisely using
pitch bend parameters. Unlike traditional MIDI, MPE assigns
each note its own channel, enabling independent control of pitch,
timbre, pressure, and volume per note, allowing digital instru-
ments to respond more expressively. In Ableton Live (tested on
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Dalmazzo et al.
Figure 3: The Grid Scene: Modal Interchange in 53-TET
Live 11 and 12), this patch functions as a MIDI effect on any track,
sending data to another track containing a Wavetable synth or
any MPE-compatible instrument.
The second section is an interface visualization that contains
a Scale Editor to adjust the interval distances, select the root, and
the inversion of the chords. It includes a voicing visualization and
editor to change the voicing parameters of the chords. An 8x8
grid with empty first-row slots, where chords can be dragged to
compose chord progression; the other seven rows are modal inter-
change substitutions of the original chord progression, allowing
listening, testing, and exploring harmonic possibilities of musical
ideas in microtonality. It is programmed in OpenFrameworks
version 0.12.0_Nighlty on Mac Sonoma 14.5.
4.1 The Bridge
Some DAWs can now map a MIDI piano roll into other temper-
aments. That is an easy solution for initial explorations, but it
reduces the pitch range, as the limit of 128 keys is now mapped to
a more detailed resolution. For example, 53-TET ends with only
2 octaves and some extra notes; if we start from A0, it reaches
D2 minus 1 HC.
Therefore, we resolved this issue by still using the standard
12-TET range but adjusting the pitches implementing MPE. A
MaxForLive patch receives an Open Sound Control (OSC) message
with an array of a tuple with 53-TET notes and velocity. It is
processed by a [poly∼] object with 15 voices.
The [poly∼] object converts 53-TET notes to standard MIDI/MPE
by treating each step in 53-TET as a shift in frequency, with an
offset frequency 𝐾 = 55.18012 Hz. This offset aligns 0 HC to the
MIDI note 𝐴1 and 13 HC to 𝐶2. The reference frequency 𝑓 for a
given scale degree 𝑛is calculated as:
𝑓 = 2𝑛/53 ·𝐾
The reference frequency 𝑓 is then translated to MIDI using
the following formula:
𝑚= 69 +12 log2 (𝑓/440)
The mapped reference in MPE is defined as:
MPE = (⌊𝑚⌋,𝑚 mod 1)
Here, ⌊𝑚⌋represents the floor function corresponding to the
MIDI_note. The 𝑚 mod 1 represents the fractional part used by
the pitchBend. If pitchBend = 1, it is added to the MIDI_note, and
its value is flattened to pitchBend = 0.
This method enables arrays of the tuple (53-TET, Velocity)
chords to be mapped onto any DAW platform without losing the
full spectrum of frequencies.
4.2 Interface Design
The scenes of the computer application are:
The Grid Scene consists of an 8×8 grid with free slots designed
for experimenting with chord progressions and modal inter-
change substitutions, as shown in Fig. 3. It features:
• A drag-and-drop chord list : It is formed with the Ionian modes,
starting with its seven chords (Cmaj7, Dm7, Em7, Fmaj7, G7,
Am7, and Bø7), and all those chords can be placed in the grid’s
first row to compose a chord progression.
• A Scale Editor: It allows the edition of notes contained in the
main modal scale configuration in 53-TET, as shown in the visual-
ization tool in Fig. 4. The exploration of different configurations
starts with C Ionian as a reference. The interval names in 53-TET
are shown, highlighting all relevant qualities available for 3rd,
5th, and 7th. For example, the harmonic 3rd and 7th are also
marked. From the Scale Editor, it is possible to experiment with
other configurations and intervallic distances such as subminor,
downminor, minor, upminor, and neutral minor. The Scale Editor
has an inversion wheel to configure other root dispositions of
the chord, for example, Cmaj7/E. The internal wheel is used to
choose any of the 53-TET available notes in the first three oc-
taves to define the tonic of the available chords. All nodes can be
dragged, and the internal wheels can be rotated.
• A Voicing Editor: We use the principle of the spiral visualization
(zenithal view) of the disposition of the note per octave, based
on Chew’s method [10]. It is assigned by clicking on any chords
available in the Grid. As shown in Fig. 5, the white notes are the
active notes where the lower pitch starts in the smaller circle. A
reference of the guide tones is shown in the reference wheels;
each wheel is an octave upper from the root. The guide tones are
shown in their related location of the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and extensions.
The voicing is predefined concerning its function. However, a
dynamic voicing checks for previous chords on its corresponding
row and adapts the higher note to maintain an organic motion
from chord to chord. The 9th is used as a pivot note that can be
included to make chord transitions smoother.
The Modes Scene The second scene displays all modes trans-
posed to the reference root, starting with standard Greek modes.
While we retain their names as reference points, they become
less applicable when scales are edited (see section 5.3). This scene
A Computer Application to Explore 53-Tone Equal Temperament Harmonies Through Modal Interchange NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia
Figure 4: Scale Editor interface
Figure 5: Voicing Editor interface
allows users to experiment with new scales and chord colors
through clickable chords (Fig. 6). It features a list of seventh
chords derived from each mode, all transposed to the root se-
lected in the Scale Editor.
The Scales Scene The third scene contains the scales of all Greek
modes transposed to the reference root, allowing the user to
experiment with melodic constructions. As Ableton Live controls
all sounds, recording this interaction in a MIDI track is also
possible. All notes are clickable to trigger the sound. The Scene
is shown in Fig. 7
The Lumatone Scene The fourth scene displays notes in the
format of the Lumatone microtonal keyboard [18], allowing users
to explore its key layout.
As anAbleton Live extension, all sounds are generated via MPE-
compatible MIDI instruments, with played chords recordable as
standard MIDI tracks editable through any DAW tool.
We integrated the Launchpad Pro [MK3] controller for real-
time interaction, mapping its touch-sensitive triggers to the 8x8
interface grid. This grid is organized with the first row for orig-
inal chord progression composition and seven rows below for
modal interchange substitutions: parallel Dorian, Phrygian, and
Aeolian, followed by relative Dorian, Phrygian, Aeolian, and
Locrian (Fig.3). The Launchpad can also function as a keyboard
for playing reference scales in other scenes.
5 Demo and Discussion
5.1 Modes Examples
In the Modes Scene , we have a disposition of all modes with
their respective chords in a 7x8 matrix of clickable buttons. The
Modes can be changed using the Scale Editor and the Voicing
Editor.
The Modes Scene lets users experiment with different scale
configurations, exploring microtonal harmonies by extending
Western principles. Users create modes by dividing 53-TET into
seven-note scales. The HC array [0,9,9,4,9,9,9,4]corresponds
to 12-TET [𝐶,𝐷,𝐸,𝐹,𝐺,𝐴,𝐵,𝐶 ], forming the Ionian modeCmaj7,
Dm7, Em7, Fmaj7, G7, Am7, Bø7, Cmaj7. Through the Scale
Editor, users can explore various 53-TET subdivisions, generat-
ing new chord qualities and colors.
To discuss some basic examples of modes and new chord qual-
ities, in Fig. 8, three configurations are shown:
• Ionian Mode: The first row shows the standard Ionian modal
sequence of chord qualities and its corresponding array of HCs
distances.
• SubMinor Mode: In the second row, we have an array of HCs
distances [0,9,3,10,9,3,10,9]with chord degrees Cvm7, Dø7,
vvD#^m^m7, Fvmvm7, Gm7, vvG#^m^m7, BbMvm7 . The Mvm7
chord exhibits dominant quality while aligning with the har-
monic series, making standard 12-TET dominant sevenths sound
misaligned by comparison. The vm7 sounds like a well-tuned
minor, and the ^M^M provides a pleasing maj7 sonority.
• Harmonic 3rd, and Harmonic 7th Mode: The fourth row is
formed by the HCs distances [0,9,8,5,9,8,4,10]and its chord
formation CvMvm7, Dm7, vEø^m7, FvMvM7, Gvm7, vA^m^m7,
vBb^Mmaj7. The vMvm7 appears dominant-like but it is consonant
with harmonically aligned intervals (5/4, 3/2, 7/4). Dm7 functions
conventionally, vEø^m7 provides subdominant quality, vMvM7 of-
fers enhanced consonance, and vm7 works as a traditional minor.
^m^m7 creates a distinctive consonant block sound with possible
dominant function, while ^Mmaj7 is less stable than maj7 orvMvM.
5.2 Examples of Modal Interchanges
The Modal Interchange navigation is done in the Grid Scene .
This scene allows the user to drag and drop chords from a list of
seventh chords formed out of the current configuration of the
Scale Editor. These chords are placed in the first row, and the
Modal Interchange occurs automatically. For practical demon-
stration, we’ve implemented several 53-TET modal interchange
examples in our application. Hear these chord progressions at
our project website.1

In Fig. 9, we show the functional chord progression "I, IV,
ii, V, I " using harmonic 3rd and 7th chords, expressed as
CvMvm7[I], FvMvM7[IV], Dm7[II], Gvm7[V], CvMvm7[I] .
The second row shows Dorian parallel substitutions:CvMvm7[I],
Fvm7[IV], vDø^m7[II], vG^m^m7[V], CvMvm7[I]. The third
row’s Phrygian substitution features notable voice movement
from F^m^m7[IV] (leading voice D#) to C#vMvM7[II] (D# be-
comes 9th), to vF#^Mmaj7[V] (leading voice moves to C#, the
5th), resolving to D (9th) in CvMvm7[I]. Row 7 shows Relative
Aeolian substitution (Fig. 10) with CvMvm7[I] in the last quad-
rant (without 9th), and rootvEbvMvm7[I]. Voice movement from
G#MvM7[IV] (G#, C, D# G) to ^Fm7[ii] (^F, G#, C, D#)
transforms D# from 5th to 7th, then to ^Bbvm7[V] (^Bb, vC#,
^F, G#), where leading voice C# resolves to D (9th) inCvMvm7[I].
As an observation, these harmonic motions demonstrate that
standard Western modal interchange principles remain struc-
turally sound in 53-TET while offering greater precision. The
microtonal system allows for specific chord qualities like vMvm7
and ^m^m7 that maintain their functional roles within progres-
sions while providing more accurate representations of inter-
vallic relationships aligning closer to the harmonic series. This
higher resolution system extends rather than replaces traditional
harmonic practices.

5.3 Conclusion and Future Work
We’ve developed a computer application for exploring micro-
tonal harmony, featuring real-time chord exploration, interactive
visualization, and MIDI controller support. Our approach extends
modern harmonic principles into 53-tone equal temperament,
expanding traditional tonality with modal interchanges, paral-
lel chord substitutions, and microtonal intervals to reveal new
harmonic relationships. Our implementation connects standard
MIDI with microtonal control through a custom MaxForLive "The
Bridge" and OpenFrameworks interface, demonstrating how es-
tablished theories can adapt to extended tuning systems. This
work provides both theoretical foundations and practical tools for
composers to access a broader spectrum of musical expression.
Future work will focus on evaluating and enhancing the de-
veloped application. First, qualitative studies will be conducted
with relevant artists in the field in order to gather feedback and
inform further improvements.
We aim to define new functions and advance microtonality in
music theory by automating the generation of wav sound files
containing all possible chords, as detailed in Section 3.3. Each
chord file, annotated with a corresponding JSON file specifying

rithms to classify chords by harmonic properties. Specifically,
we’ll analyze chord consonance and dissonance relative to the
harmonic series and apply Music Information Retrieval tools to
extract audio descriptor features. Dimensionality reduction tech-
niques (PCA, t-SNE) and variational autoencoders will create a
meaningful lower-dimensional representation, enabling cluster-
ing algorithms (k-means, hierarchical clustering, GMM) to group
chords by harmonic similarity. This approach will reveal clear
patterns in chord qualities for further combinatorial exploration.
