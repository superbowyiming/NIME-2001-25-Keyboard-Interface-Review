ABSTRACT
The majority of musical robotics performances, projects and
installations utilise microcontroller hardware to digitally in-
terface the robotic instruments with sequencer software and
other musical controllers, often via a personal computer.
While in many ways digital interfacing oﬀers considerable
power and ﬂexibility, digital protocols, equipment and audio
workstations often tend to suggest particular music-making
work-ﬂows and have resolution and timing limitations. This
paper describes the creation of a hardware interface that
allows direct communication between analogue synthesizer
equipment and simple robotic musical instruments entirely
in the analogue domain without the use of computers, mi-
crocontrollers or software of any kind. Several newly created
musical robots of various designs are presented, together
with a custom built hardware interface with circuitry that
enables analogue synthesizers to interface with the robots
without any digital intermediary. This enables novel meth-
ods of musical expression, creates new music-making work-
ﬂows for composing and improvising with musical robots
and takes advantage of the low latency and inﬁnite resolu-
tion of analogue circuits.

1. INTRODUCTION
The ﬁeld of musical robotics is concerned with creating mu-
sic and sound-art using automated acoustic sound-objects,
predominantly under computer control. Various digital pro-
tocols such as MIDI, OSC and custom solutions such as
Tangle [6] are used to control these robotic instruments and
interface them with electronic instruments and controllers.
However, despite the variety of electronic musical instru-
ments being produced with analogue control voltage (CV)
interfacing options, there have so far been few solutions for

utilizing the possibilities of these signals in conjunction with
musical robotic devices directly. This paper describes the
creation of a hardware interface that enables bi-directional
communication between analogue synthesizer systems and
several varieties of simple musical robot entirely in the ana-
logue domain, enabling musicians and artists to take advan-
tage of the beneﬁts that CV-based systems oﬀer, together
with the acoustic sound and real-world visual feedback of
musical robots.
First, brief backgrounds of musical robotics and analogue
synthesizers are oﬀered in order to place this research into
context. The set of custom-built musical robots that are
used with this system is then described, categorized by the
devices’ primary actuators. Following that, the hardware
and functionality of the interface is detailed in sections. The
paper will then conclude by presenting the results of experi-
ments undertaken with the prototype, and outlining several
improvements that are planned for the future.
2. BACKGROUND
Mechanical musical instruments have existed for over a mil-
lennium; one of the earliest recorded examples was the Banu
Musa automatic water organ, which was described in the
Book of Ingenious Devicesin 850AD [11]. These types of
devices did not become commonplace until the mass produc-
tion of automated instruments such as orchestrions, player
pianos and music boxes began in the late 19th century. [1] is
a comprehensive reference of instruments created through-
out this period.
The invention of the phonograph and the proliferation of
loudspeaker technology in the early 20th century resulted
in the popularity of automated musical instruments waning
and production practically ceasing altogether. Despite this,
composers such as Conlon Nancarrow continued to write
music for automated instruments, utilising their ability to
play music that would be diﬃcult if not impossible for hu-
mans to perform. In the 1970s as transistors became more
prevalent, a new breed of artists such as Trimpin and God-
fried Willem Raes began to create new automated musi-
cal instruments, this time with precise computer control.
In the 21st century, as microcontroller technology has be-
come more aﬀordable and easier to use, the ﬁeld of musical
robotics has grown signiﬁcantly. [9] and [3] provide more
detailed accounts of the history of musical robotics.
Analogue synthesizers have experienced a similar trajec-
tory to that of musical automata, displaced by several decades.
Though vacuum tube based synthesizers were produced ear-
lier, the transistor ushered in an age of more aﬀordable
analogue synthesizers in the 1960s and 1970s created by pi-
oneers such as Dave Smith, Robert Moog and Don Buchla.
These instruments relied on various control voltage stan-
dards to communicate with each other. Advances in dig-
ital technology in the 1980s made new types of synthesis
51
available while decreasing costs. Digital synthesizers such
as the Yamaha DX7 did not require tuning, had the con-
venient ability to store and recall preset sounds and used
the MIDI standard for communication. These capabili-
ties, among other factors, made digital models very pop-
ular and the production of analogue synthesizers declined.
In the 1990s, the shortcomings of many of the digital of-
ferings were becoming understood, and a range of virtual
analogue synthesizers (digital synthesizers that imitate ana-
logue synthesizers) were brought to market. The 2000s and
the 2010s have witnessed a resurgence in the popularity of
analogue synthesizers and several companies such as Korg
and Roland have delivered reissues of their analogue oﬀer-
ings as well as entirely new analogue products, complete
with CV/Gate interfacing capabilities. Academic interest
in analogue synthesis has also surged in recent years with
projects such as Dahlstedt’s Pencil Fields [2] and MIT’s
Patchwork project [7]. A detailed description of the advan-
tages of CV/Gate is outside the scope of this paper; for
more details, [14] is recommended reading on this subject.
Though the area of interfacing CV signals with sensors
and actuators in the outside world is largely unexplored,
the Sense, DC Motor, Servo and Solenoid modules produced
by Bastl Instruments 1 are capable examples that seem to
share the goals of the presented system.

3. THE ROBOTS
An ensemble of musical robots was created by the ﬁrst au-
thor for the purposes of musical performances and installa-
tions. These robots utilise a variety of actuators, at several
voltage levels and with diﬀering methods of control. The
categories of the robots are described below along with the
control requirements of each variety.
3.1 Solenoid-based
1http://www.bastl-instruments.com/modular/
The solenoid-based devices used are shown in Figure 1. The
castanet and striking mechanisms perform optimally at 48
volts, and require short pulses of current to execute a strike,
with springs returning the devices to their resting positions.
This method of control resembles the trigger signals of ana-
logue synthesizers. The construction and evaluation of sev-
eral of these types of strikers is outlined in [4].
The instruments shown in the lower half of Figure 1 all use
rotary solenoids and require separate on and oﬀ commands.
This type of signal is analogous to synthesizer gate signals.
3.2 RC Servo-based
Many musical robots make use of servo motors to perform
various operations. They may be used as strikers [13], fret-
ters [10], or to apply friction as is the case for the robotic
singing bowl shown on the left of Figure 2. Analogue servo
motors require PWM control signals to operate, which are
often generated by microcontrollers. In the interface pre-
sented however, a circuit based on the 555 timer IC is used
to generate these pulses.
3.3 Stepper Motor
Robots such as the Mechbass robotic bass guitar [8] utilise
stepper motors to achieve precise positioning of components
of the instrument. In other cases, such as with the robotic
ratchet shown on the right of Figure 2, less precise control
can still produce interesting musical results. An A3967 IC
built into the ratchet allows the motor to take individual
steps with each pulse received.

mated Ratchet.
3.4 DC Motor
Several artists such as Mo. H. Zareei have used DC motors
in musical projects [15]. The speed of DC motors may be
controlled by varying the voltage applied to them, or by sim-
ulating this by way of varying the width of pulses of current
sent to the motors. This type of control can be compared
with CV or PWM signals generated by synthesizers.
4. THE INTERFACE
In order to integrate these varying types of musical robot
into an analogue synthesizer work-ﬂow, the hardware in-
terface pictured in Figure 3 was created. The top panel is
divided into two sections, the red half for the high power
connections to the musical robots, and the black half for

interfacing with analogue hardware via CV/Gate signals.
Red coloured patch cables are used for the high powered
connections to aid in ensuring that they are never connected
to synthesizer equipment, which would cause damage.
The functionality of the interface is also grouped verti-
cally, with each socket of the low power section correspond-
ing to the socket in the high power section directly opposite
it. The details of each section of the interface will be de-
scribed below, referring to Figure 3.
4.1 Servo Control
To control the position of a servo motor, a stream of pulses
between 1 ms and 2 ms in length must be produced at a rate
of approximately 50 Hz. Initially, a method which made
use of the pulsewidth modulation capabilities of analogue
oscillators was trialed, but was found to be ineﬀective due
to the accuracy required of the pulsewidth and the fact that
many analogue oscillators restrict the production of very
thin pulses. Instead, a method which uses a 555 timer to
generate the required pulses was chosen. When a CV is
received, it is passed through the Servo CV potentiometer
and the attenuated signal is subsequently used to modulate
the width of the pulses produced by the 555 timer circuit.
The 555 circuit outputs a PWM signal that is then sent
together with ground and 5V connections via a TRS jack on
the high power side of the unit to the servo to be controlled.
4.2 Solenoid Control
There are two types of solenoid control provided on the
unit, toggle and one-shot. Toggle mode is useful for instru-
ments that have separate on and oﬀ positions such as the
rattle drums and egg shakers shown in Figure 1. The Toggle
Solenoid Gate input on the interface is designed to receive
a standard gate or other CV signal. Gate signals are passed
through, and smoother signals are processed by a discrete
transistor circuit to buﬀer and convert them into standard
gate signals. This 2-state signal is then passed to the simple
MOSFET circuit presented in [5] to control the solenoids.
One-shot mode is useful for instruments such as the cas-
tanet and striker units which require a short pulse of power
to create a strike, and return to their resting positions by
way of a spring. The One-Shot Trigger input on the in-
terface is capable of receiving trigger, gate and CV signals
and transforming them into short pulses to activate the in-
struments. It achieves this by using discrete transistors to
buﬀer, invert and transform the incoming voltage into an
inverted 5V gate, which acts as the trigger for a 555 timer
running in a monostable conﬁguration. The One Shot Trig-
ger potentiometer sets the default pulsewidth of the 555
timer, which dictates the velocity of the resultant strike. A
One-Shot CV input is also provided to modulate this veloc-
ity, and is attenuated by the One-Shot CV potentiometer.
This can be thought of as emulating the functionality of the
voltage controlled ampliﬁers (VCAs) of analogue synthesiz-
ers. The output of the monostable 555 timer is applied to
a power MOSFET to control a solenoid in an identical way
to the toggle circuit described above.
4.3 Motor Control
The speed of simple DC motors may be controlled by ad-
justing the voltage supplied to them, altering their musical
results. The interface features a Motor CV input which is
attenuated by the Motor CV potentiometer. Gate or CV
signals are input and sent through an ampliﬁer circuit which
provides gain, buﬀers the signal and provides suﬃcient cur-
rent to drive the motor.
4.4 Stepper Control
Though stepper motors are commonly controlled by mi-
crocontrollers, it is possible to control them via analogue
means, and the process is simpliﬁed by utilizing an inte-
grated circuit such as the A3967 Microstepping Driver. This
device is able to utilise a gate signal to control the direction
of rotation, and the rising edge of a trigger signal to advance
the motor forward in individual steps.
The interface accepts a CV, gate or trigger signal at the
Stepper Trigger input, and similar to the solenoid control
circuits, buﬀers and quantizes the voltage into a gate signal
before passing the output to the step input of the destina-
tion A3967. The robotic ratchet instrument shown on the
right of Figure 2 works in only one direction and does not
require a microstepping function, so these settings are hard-
wired inside the robot’s enclosure. This allows a single TRS
cable from the interface to provide the supply voltage and
step control functions necessary to operate the robot.
4.5 Feedback from the Physical World
There are a number of projects which are based around
connecting unconventional sources of voltages to analogue
synthesizers in order to create interesting and expressive
musical eﬀects. These projects commonly utilize voltage
outputs from light-dependent resistors (LDRs), infrared de-
tectors and other sensors and in some cases these sensors are
positioned to sense the motion of DC motors or other actu-
ators such as in the Optical Tremolo described in [12]. This
interface provides buﬀered CV and gate inputs for the pur-
poses of safely connecting these types of devices to analogue
synthesizers. This also enables the possibility of closed-loop
feedback between musical robots and analogue synthesizers,
an example conﬁguration being a DC motor whose control
signal is being modulated by the output of an LDR which
is sensing the movement of that same motor.
4.6 Power Supply
Because this interface is designed to control several vari-
eties of actuator, the power supply must also provide mul-
tiple levels of voltage to power the robots. The internal
power supply is based around a multi-tapped transformer,
bridge rectiﬁers and smoothing capacitors and provides un-
regulated power at 48V, 24V and 12V, and a regulated 5V
supply. The 5V supply line provides power for the servo mo-
tor connection and acts as a reference for the gate circuits.
53
The 12V supply provides the power for the DC motor and
stepper motor outputs. The solenoid outputs each feature
a panel-mounted switch to utilize either the 48V or 24V
power levels, depending on the requirements of the user.
5. LATENCY DISCUSSION
Though a musician may choose an analogue synthesizer to
musical robot interface for subjective reasons such as mak-
ing changes to their music-making work-ﬂow, there also ex-
ist more tangible beneﬁts to using such an interface. One
diﬀerence is that while many digital systems use low resolu-
tion MIDI control parameters and some utilise higher reso-
lutions, analogue systems such as this provide an eﬀectively
inﬁnite resolution with which to make musical adjustments.
Another more objective beneﬁt is the low latency opera-
tion of the interface compared with digital equivalents. [5]
provides a method of evaluating the latency of musical robotic
control systems by way of measuring the distance in time
from when a control signal is sent and a signal is observed
from a magnetic coil mounted in close proximity to the
solenoid under control. In those tests utilising MIDI control,
the average distance in time between a MIDI Note-On mes-
sage being sent from a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),
being interpreted and forwarded via a microcontroller and
the resulting signal being observed by the magnetic coil was
3.58 ms. This test was recreated by routing a square shaped
output of an analogue low frequency oscillator (LFO) mod-
ule to the One-Shot input of the interface, and having it
control an Ushio rotary solenoid based striker, similar to
the previous evaluations, with an electromagnetic pickup
mounted in close-proximity. The output of the LFO and the
electromagnetic coil were recorded concurrently at a sam-
ple rate of 44.1kHz in order to inspect the time diﬀerence in
the signals. The result over 10 iterations was that the rising
slope of the LFO corresponded with a rising slope of voltage
in the electromagnetic coil on the same exact sample. This
means that the latency was smaller than could be observed
by this method of measurement, a signiﬁcant improvement
over the MIDI-based system.
6. FUTURE WORK
As the interface presented in this paper is the initial pro-
totype, there are several areas planned for further develop-
ment. One area is the issue surrounding using phono jacks
for both the low and high power connections. Though this
conﬁguration provides convenience for advanced users, non-
compatible sockets for the high power connections could
provide a lower risk of incident for inexperienced users.
While this has not been an issue thus far in practice, fu-
ture improvements may also include PTC thermistors for
overload protection or short-circuit detection circuitry. The
possibility of providing CV controllable voltage sources for
many of the outputs rather than set 48V and 24V is another
area that is being investigated. Once a more widely appli-
cable design is decided upon, creating an enclosure that is
compatible with standard modular synthesizer systems such
as Eurorack is also planned.
7. CONCLUSIONS
This paper has described the design and construction of
a hardware interface that enables musicians to create mu-
sic with musical robots in conjunction with hardware syn-
thesizers entirely within the analogue realm. This extends
the work-ﬂow options and resolution and timing beneﬁts of
CV/gate control to the ﬁeld of musical robotics and enables
novel methods of musical performance, improvisation and
composition. By outlining the functionality of each section
of the unit, it is hoped that interested practitioners will
be able to apply the described concepts in a combination
relevant to their own musical requirements.
