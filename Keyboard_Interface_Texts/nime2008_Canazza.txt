ABSTRACT 
Musical open works can be often thought like sequences of 
musical structures, which can be arranged by anyone who 
had access to them and who wished to real ize the work.  
This paper proposes an innovative agent -based system to 
model the information and organize it in structured 
knowledge; to create effective, graph -centric browsing 
perspectives and views for the user ; to use authoring tools 
for the performance  of open work of electro -acoustic 
music.

1. INTRODUCTION 
A classical musical composition (a Beethoven’s 
symphony, a Mozart’s sonata, or Stravinsky’s Rite of 
Spring) po sits an assemblage of sound units that the 
composer arranged in a closed, well -defined manner 
before presenting it to the listener. He converted his idea 
into conventional symbols, obliging (more or less) the 
(eventual) performer to reproduce the format de vised by 
the composer himself. On the contrary, a number of music 
pieces (or, more general, of multimedia works) are linked 
by a common feature: the considerable autonomy left to 
the individual performer1 in the way he chooses to play the 
work. Thus he is not merely free to interpret the 
composer’s instructions following his own discretion (as 
happens in traditional music), but he must impose his 
judgment on the form of the piece, as when he decides in 
what order to group the sounds: a real act of improvise d 
creation. In Klavierstück XI , Karlheinz Stockhausen 
presents to the performer a single large sheet of music 
                                                                 
1 As it is well known, the practical intervention of a performer 
(the musician who plays a music piece) is different from that of 
an interpreter in the sense of consumer (somebody who listens 
to a musical composition performed by somebody else). In this 
context, however, both cases are seen as different 
manifestations of the same interpretative attitude  [5].

paper with a series of note groupings; he then has to 
choose among these groupings, first for the starting unit 
and, next, for the successive ones  in the order in which he 
elects to weld them together: in this way, he can mount the 
sequence of musical units in the order he chooses, 
changing the combinative structure of the piece. In Pierre 
Boulez’ Third Sonata for piano , the first section 
(Antiphonie, Formant 1) is made up of ten different pieces 
on ten corresponding sheets of music paper. These can be 
arranged in different sequences like a stack of filing cards, 
though not all possible permutations are permissible. A 
particularly representative exam ple of musical open work 
is Scambi, an analogue tape work created in 1957 by the 
Belgian composer Henri Pousseur at the Studio di 
Fonologia in Milan. By means of a specific process, called 
dynamic filtering (realized by using a special equipment, 
designed by Alfredo Lietti, the engineer of the studio), the 
composer is able to extract from noise animated time 
structures, then to process them further in different 
parameters, and thus to produce 32 sequences. These 
sequences can be arranged by anyone who had a ccess to 
them and who wished to realize the work, according to 
certain rules regarding their order and possible 
overlapping.  
Today several multimedia artistic works are ‘in 
progress’, ‘open’ in structure or in realization. Here the 
audio recording is incl uded in a complex procedure of 
audio signal processing and where different writing 
systems (video, text, static pictures, gestures) flow 
together. In this field emerges the necessity to define 
suitable data structures and to convey, in a single (digital) 
medium, verbal and musical documents, pictures, audio 
and video signals. 
The aim of this paper is to provide an innovative 
system for the performance of electro -acoustic music open 
works, considered as a representative subset of multimedia 
artistic works. W ill be introduced innovative authoring 
tools able to make open a musical work, enabling the user 
to become self-author of new versions for a given work.  
These topics are faced using an agent-based extension 
of the ZigZag model. Conceiving a system as aggr egation 
of autonomous and cooperative agents is one of the most 
exciting aspects of the challenging arena known as multi -
agent system (MAS); this perspective revolutionizes 
radically the way in which a model may be conceived and 
work [3]. In addition, the presence of ZigZag model 
guaranties a graph -centric browsing tool, which supports 
the representation of persistent context: user visualizes the 
unit of interest in relation to other associated units. But 
more than this, he sees the unit of interest from th at unit's 
position relative to multiple perspectives or orientations. 
As case study, we chose the cited, complex electro -

acoustic open work ( Scambi by Henri Pousseur), 
characterized by a variety of sequences and of different 
performance degrees of freedom. 
2. ACTOR–BASED ZIGZAG MODEL 
In order to present our model in section 3 , t his section 
introduces in two separate  subsections (2.1 and 2.2 ) the 
basics of the ZigZag model and a brief description of the 
actors, a particular class of computational agents. 
2.1 The ZigZag model 
ZigZag [6] introduces a new, graph -centric system of 
conventions for data and computing; it separates the 
structure of information from its visualization (i.e. the way 
the data – text, audio, video - is presented to the user); 
therefore a ZigZag  structure handles all the different 
visualizations necessary to realize an Electronic Edition of 
musical works. 
The main element present in the ZigZag model is the 
zz-structure: it can be viewed as a multigraph where edges 
are colored, with the restrictio n that every vertex, called 
zz-cell, has at most two incident edges of the same color; 
the sub-graphs, each of which contains edges of a unique 
color, are called dimensions.  The cells in a same 
dimension are linked into linear and directed sequences, 
called ranks. Each dimension can contain a number of 
parallel ranks, which are a series of distinct cells connected 
sequentially. 
Since there is no canonical visualization, the pseudo -
space generated by zz -structures is called zz -space and 
may be viewed in var ious ways. A view is a presentation 
of some portion of zz -space and is presented by a view 
program, which visualizes, for example, a region around a 
particular cursor. 
A 2D view can be drawn picking a single cell as a 
focal point, and drawing the neighborh ood around that cell 
along two chosen dimensions. By changing the chosen pair 
of dimensions, we can visually reveal, hide, and rearrange 
nodes in interesting ways. Considering that a zz -structure 
may be very large, and that there is usually not enough 
room in the 2D view for all of the cells, we restrict the 
dimension of the 2D view. 
Some observations are necessary on the zz -cells; they 
are the principal unit of the system and they are conceived 
not only as passive containers of primitive data (i.e., text, 
graphics, audio, etc.) but they can have types, based either 
on their functions or on the types of data they contain. 
Thus, a zz -cell may have a variety of different properties 
and functions, such as executable program or scripts (this 
type of cell is call ed progcell), or represent the package of 
different cells (this type of cell is called referential cell). 
Analogous observations can be made on the 
dimensions; in fact, they can be passive and nominal 
(merely receiving and presenting data) or operational, 
programmed to monitor changing zz-structures and events, 
and calculate and present results automatically (for 
example, the dimensions d.cursor and the dimension 
d.clone). From these considerations it turns out that it is 
reductive to associate zz -cells to passive entities meant 
simple nodes are in a graph. So, we have considered the 
opportunity to model a zz-cell by means of a specific class 
of computational agents, the actors. 
2.2 Brief description of the actor model 
The actor model [1] is a model of concurrent computations 
in distributed systems; it  is organized as a universe of 
inherently autonomous computational agents, called 
actors, which interact with each other by sending 
messages, improving on the sequential limitations of 
passive objects. 
Each actor is defined by three parts: a passive part, which 
is a set of local variables, termed acquaintances, that 
constitute its internal state; an active part , that reacts to 
the external environments by executing its procedural 
skills, called scripts. T his active p art constitutes actor’s 
behaviour; the third part is represented by the actor’s  mail 
queue, which buffers incoming communication (i.e. 
messages). 
Each actor has a unique name (the uniqueness property) 
and a given behaviour; it communicates with other actor s 
via asynchronous messages. Actors are reactive in nature, 
i.e., they execute only in response to messages received.  
An actor can perform three basic actions on receiving a 
message: create a finite number of actors with universally 
fresh names, send a fi nite n umber of  messages and 
assume a new behaviour.  
The actor's behavio ur is deterministic in that its response 
to a message is uniquely determined by the message 
contents and its internal state. Furthermore, all actions 
performed on receiving a message are concurrent. 
In order to describe the actors in our model we adopt the 
formalism used in [3]: 
!"#$%&'()*!&'()*+,-$!
!!./01$*/(23%*)-!45,223+,-$6!
7,'89,/0(,0'$2!!5/2(:!
;2'*/<(2!5/2(=!>!
Therefore a n actor is described by specifying its 
superclass, its data  part and its script part ; the script part 
represents the set of scripts that can be executed. 
3. THE MODEL 
The architecture of our model is organized in two layers: a 
component layer  contains the zz -cells, those are actors 
specifically designed to model the audio documents 
domain; a meta layer  contains the actors classes 
specialized, for example, to manage connections among 
zz-cells or to generate specific views on them. The 
interaction between actors is defined using the 
diagrammatic language AUML (Agent Uni fied Modelling 
Language) [8], extension of UML for agents. 
3.1 Component layer 
The component layer is defined in relation to the magnetic 
tape structure: each open reel is usually composed by 
several physical segment s, i.e. pieces of magnetic tape 
connected by means of adhesive tape (called junction). 
In each segment, the audio signal is recorded in one, two 
or more tracks. Following th is structure we define  the 
actors ?)9*'$, @1A2/',5?$B-$0(, and #/B/(,5?/B0,5. 
Moreover, the actor C)B/',5?$B-$0( is introduced, with the 
aim to compare the sources on the bas is of a segmentation 
that is different by the physical one. The actor ?)9*'$ 
represents the overall characteristics of the document, such 
as the tape width (typical values are 1/4, 1/2, 1, and 2 inch) 
and the cataloguing fields. 
"#$%&'()*!?)9*'$!

It contains also a list of <1/2/',5?$B-$0(2, which compound 
the open reel tape. This actor is able to perform seve ral

actions, e.g. the script !"#!$#"%&'$("%)*+ asks each physical 
document for his length and rate and it calculates the total 
duration of the tape. The ,*-)!"#.&-/&+% carries out a

(e.g. D olby or dbx), the %("!<5,";*$% (i.e. the tracks 
number and width), a pointer to the :)-)%"#.)-+"# 
representing the audio recorded on each track, and an 
"$:)*=$"#)%; index, that can be subjectively specified by 
the user. If the "$:)*=$"#)%; field is left blank, the script 
-&%=$"#)%; asks the :)-)%"#.)-+"# to estimate the signal to 
noise ratio of each track and returns an index of quality. 
The script -&%.)-+"#A(*B&(%)&5 asks the :)-)%"#.)-+"# for the 
digital audio of each track and estimates if the audio signal 
is monophonic, stereophonic, or polyphonic.  This 
information doesn’t always correspond to the number of 
tracks, because, following the practice of magnetic 
recording, a monophonic signal can be recorded on a 
multi-track format, writing the same signal in all the 
tracks. A specialization of this actor class is the

the segment, such as the angle of his junction.

properties of the junction, calculates the duration of the 
fade-in and fade -out of the audio at the segment edges.

Its acquaintances are related to the numeric format: 
number of samples, sampling rate, and resolution. :"%"E)KHG 
is a matrix, with a row for each track and a column for 
each sample. This actor can perform several actions that, 
using signal -processing techniques, calcula te signal to 
noise ratio, short -time Fourier transform, amplitude 
envelope or other kinds of representations. 
3.2 Meta layer 
In order to manage the inform ation in a zz -structure 
context, a meta layer is  added . Following the rank 
definition introduced in ZigZag  model, the actor 9"+< can 
be described as an ordered  list of actors,  belonging to the 
same dimension. Each specific dimension contains one or 
more ranks. Examples of dimensions are: 
• source dimension, that composes given sources as an 
ordered sequence of segments;  
• equivalent segments dimension: links segments with a 
common music content present in different sources. 
For each dimension, we  define specialized classes of 
actors, (such as .*$(!&9"+< and M7$)N"#&+%.&-/&+%59"+<D. 
0'&12!%*(3.*$(!&9"+<3

Another typology of meta -actor is the -&+&("%)N&A(*!&55; 
this class is devoted to generate dynamic new virtual 
hyperdocuments.

4. CASE STUDY 
We propose now the analysis of an interesting case 
study, in which we use a subset of scripts and actors 
defined above: the Pousseur’s electronic work Scambi. 
Writing about his work in 1959, Pousseur ended by 
envisaging the day when technology would allow listeners 
to make their own realizations of the work (either 
following his ‘connecting rules’ or not) and to give the, 
now active, listener the experience of a temporal event 
open to his intervention and which could therefore be 
elevated in type, as vital, creative freedom [7]. The active 
listener becomes, in effect, a composer; reception and 
interpretation are expressed as (musical) production.  
In our paper, Pousseur’s invitati on to interpret his 
work creatively as re -composition has been extended to 
remix and other types of appropriation that were not only 
permitted but welcomed by the composer [7] (a position 
that associates him with popular -music culture in which 
such freedom is assumed). 
In our case study, we have collected the original 32 
audio sequences realized by Pousseur, thanks to the 
‘Scambi Project’, Lansdown Centre for Electronic Arts, 
School of Arts, Middlesex University, UK 
(http://www.scambi.mdx.ac.uk). 
Thanks to the cooperation of different classes of 
actors, our system allows user -author to surf among the 
existing performances of Scambi (by the composer, 
Luciano Berio and others) and to create a new virtual 
source, automatically picking up the audio sections 
following the ‘connecting rules’ proposed by the 
composer. Moreover, the user-author can establish himself 
stochastic rules. 
Thanks to the separation of structure (dimensions) 
from content (zz -cell) in zz -structures, different users can 
customize their workpla ce and the visualization of same 
contents, creating new dimensions or new virtual 
performances. This is achieved activating specific actor 
collaboration schemes and is shown in following section 
4.1. 
4.1 New performances 
The four acoustic parameters taken into  account by 
Pousseur are:  
1) statistical tempo (from slow to fast); 
2) relative pitch (from low to high); 
3) homogeneity of the sound pattern (from dry to 
strong reverb); 
4) continuity (from long breaks to continuous sound). 
In Figure 1 is detailed the start - and end-situations 
for each sequence. 
 
We define equivalent segment  as the sequences that 
can follow the current sequence on the basis of Pousseur’s 
intention to ensure a transition without break (in the four

142
parameters) from one sequence to the next (a sort of 
‘continuity principle’). 
 
 
Figure 1. Characteristic per sequence (from: Decroupet [4]). 
 
This segmentation process can be iterative ly applied 
to all the sequences , obtaining a set of audio segments 
linked along two dimensions. The user-author can generate 
new performances mixing d ifferent sequences also in 
polyphonic structure. To do so , user can apply  
deterministic laws (given by the composer), sto chastic 
models or self -oriented choices; this allows user to 
generate new ‘reading’ performances of an open work.  
 
 
Figure 2. A screenshot of the system. X -axis: time, Y-axis: 
sequences. The user can be realize a polyphonic structure and 
modify the pitch, the duration and the volume of each 
sequence. 
We assume that a n user is interested in creating the 
new performance starting from a segment !"#$; this request 
is captured from the meta -actor %&$&"'()*&+",#&!! and it is 
forwarded from it to the source rank "!"# (that manages the 
logical segments !"#-, …, !"#./). "!"# sends a synchronous 
multicast message ( 0'1#21'(&321&) to all its logical 
segments. In order to enable the compari son among its 
features and that of  others  segments, each segment ( !"#4, 
45-6777./) assigns this task to the rank "&8!49 (that manages the 
logical segments able to follow !"#$ on the basis of 
Pousseur’s ‘continuity principle’). Each "&8!49 contacts (in 
synchronous multicast way) all its components ( &8!"#4!, !959
-69 :69 ;) and, following stochastic law defined off -line by 
the user o r by means of user input, it choices the 
components with the best matching. This information is 
returned to  %&$&"'()*&+",#&!!. This last actor collects the 
segments and creates the ne w requested performance. In 
Figure 2 a screenshot of the system is showed. 
5. CONCLUSION 
The era of high modernism, in which concept of the 
open work was a radical resistance to this dominant 
aesthetic, has been relegated to history. The contemporary 
western culture, as it is well -known, assumes that all 
musical works are open to perpetually renewed 
interpretation by listeners, musicologists, anal ysts, and 
performers [ 2]. In particular, in multimedia domain no 
work is permitted to resist endless (interactive) 
interpretation. This contemporary situation is partly the 
effect of the invention of the concept of the open musical 
work, in which Pousseur was a precursor. For this reason, 
the interest in Scambi is particularly high today, as also 
proved by the success obtained by the Scambi Project  
(www.scambi.mdx.ac.uk/). One effect of our work might 
be to free the historical musical open work  from its iconic 
status as history, to revive and redefine its specific 
openness within general (digital and interactive) openness, 
and to return a continuous presence to it by opening it up 
to interpretive renewal.
