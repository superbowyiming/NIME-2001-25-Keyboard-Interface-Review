Introduction
Limited research has been done on the Chinese NIME community and its  history.  
According to the recent concerns and discourse related to diversity, equity, and 
inclusion (DEI) among the MINE community, registering, the NIME history beyond the 
eurocentric perspective is critical [1]. As a scholar who has worked in this field for two 
decades, the author was humbled to be granted the privilege to interview two 
distinguished NIME technologists face-to-face via Zoom and Wechat during the COVID-
19 pandemic. Currently, there is no scholarly work in English has been done to reflect 
their work. Chinese NIME community has been thriving in recent years and 
documenting its history is important non-eurocentric/inclusive scholarly work to 
decolonize our field.
Each individual structured interview is around  three hours. These interviews were 
conducted and recorded separately. Notes were taken during and after the interviews 
and then organized and translated into English. Email and Wechat message 
communications were also used for follow-up informal interviews. These 
multigenerational interviewees are 1) the first Chinese NIME designer and maker – 
Tian Jinqin, and 2) the contemporary iconic Chinese NIME designer and

electroacoustic artist – Meng Qi. They represent different historical aspects of the 
Chinese NIME community from the technological perspective, the aesthetic 
perspective, and the sociological perspective. 
From the interviewees’ personal backgrounds to historical changes in the field, from 
their career paths development to their aesthetic pursuits, from their innovative 
practices to their philosophical views, our conversations covered a broad range of 
topics across five decades from the late 1970s to the 2020s. Much more could be 
written. The goal here is to put the current situation in historical context. 
The First NIME Innovator in China
Although unknown to many NIME researchers, Tian Jin Qin designed and built the first 
ribbon-controlled analog synthesizer that specifically can emulate Chinese traditional 
music instruments as well as create abstract sounds sometime between 1976 and 
1978. Tian was raised by a humble family in a remote rural area in northwest China, 
He built his first Chinese folk string instrument called “Banhu” at the age of 12. 
Because of poverty and the general lack of freedom to choose one’s career path in the 
1950s in China, he was sent to a trade school and received an associate degree in 
general engineering so he could be assigned to a random job. 
At that time, all jobs were controlled and assigned by the government, Tian’s was no 
exception [2]. In 1956, he got a job assignment as a mine worker at Taiyuan Mining 
Machinery factory in Shanxi ( 山西 ) Province. There, he taught himself a four-year 
undergraduate physics and mathematics during his spare time. He spent almost all of 
his limited income to build his lab, buying electrical parts and equipment. His first 
successful experiment was building a crystal radio without using any external 
electricity. He then built a series of tube radios. Eventually, he built the ultimate 
advanced superheterodyne radio at that time.
After this successful self-learning experience, he plucked up the courage to ask his 
manager to help him make a career path change to whatever low-level job was 
available in a university, so he could sit in the classes and study physics. In the fifties 
of last century’s China, this was impossible since the mining system and higher 
education system were irrelevant thus the job assignment could not be made. 
However, his manager was moved by his passion and decided to at least provide Tian 
with a new job as an inventory assistant in their own physics lab in the factory. Tian 
then moved into the lab and treated the lab as his own home. He did countless 
experiments there to advance his knowledge and occasionally taught some electrical

engineering classes. This was a major milestone for Tian’s career development. From 
then on, he was able to combine his passion for music and electrical engineering 
altogether and be creative experimentally.
As a huge fan of Chinese traditional acoustic instruments, it didn’t take Tian too long 
to find out the major shortcoming of these beautiful sounding instruments – their soft 
volumes. Because of this, Tian started to design and build specific circuits for 
amplification and filtering effects to augment these Chinese acoustic instruments’ 
original timbres as well as create innovative abstract timbres from them. His first 
experiment was augmenting a Guzheng. This was an organic innovative process 
without knowing what other researchers in the field were doing around the world. 
In the early 1960s, this earliest augmented Guzheng research work was published in a 
prestigious national research journal called “Radio Magazine/ Wu Xian Dian (WXD)”. 
He began receiving national recognition, which provided him the opportunity to attend 
the National Heroes of Cultural and Educational Symposium at the Great Hall of the 
People in Beijing. This was another milestone in his career development as this 
opportunity extended his network and allowed him to connect with other scholars in 
the field, who provided him with invaluable international research resources for his 
further exploration in this area. 
In 1964, Tian was re-assigned to Taiyuan Radio Electronics Research Institute as a 
junior electrical engineer. In 1967, he was promoted to become a senior engineer and 
established his own lab, where he finally fulfilled his original career dream. Tian 
published more than 300 audio and electrical-engineering-related research papers at 
WXD during the time periods of 1962 - 1966 and 1978 - 2004. Just like many other 
research venues were canceled during the Cultural Revolution [3], WXD was also 
canceled during 1966 - 1978.
During the cultural revolution, Tian isolated himself and avoided socializing so he 
could continue his research in electronic music instrument design.  Indeed, those were 
very difficult ten years in his life. It was also during this period of time, that his lifetime 
achievement – the ribbon-controlled analog synthesizer named “Xian Kong Qin ( 弦控
琴 )” – was realized. In 1973, the China-US relations drove towards a friendly and 
peaceful side through the “ping-pong” diplomacy during the Nixon Administration [4]. 
This historical opportunity provided Tian with a few good years to focus on his 
innovation. Without any funding support, Tian completed his first prototype in 1978.

His astounding fretless touch interface design of using ribbon sensors on the right 
hand and at the same time, using traditional Chinese string music performance 
techniques on the left hand for simultaneously continuous control of the sonic outputs 
is way ahead of his time. This instrument was based on transistor technology at the 
time. Its second-generation, XK-2, applied integrated circuits and added timbre pre-
storage and automatic accompaniment functions. 
Xian Kong Qin utilizes four electric strings to control pitches on the left hand. Since it 
is also ribbon-controlled, it can generate continuous music expressions, such as 
glissando, vibrato, and intermittent scales. It uses direct waveform, ADSR, frequency 
division, frequency doubling, time-varying filters, and other techniques to synthesize 
the timbres of a broad variety of musical instruments. It realistically simulates the 
timbres of Chinese national orchestral instruments and Chinese folk instruments by 
playing on the four-string fingerboard. The four-stringed fingerboard enables the users 
to accurately simulate the Chinese traditional music performing techniques, such as 
kneading, pressing, trembling, sliding, calendar, portamento, back portamento, string 
pressing, and string-pulling.  By adding the keyboard,  patchbay, buttons, knobs, and 
sliders, on the other end of the control panel to simultaneously control the audio 
output, the users can achieve many other novel music expressions.
The renowned online NIME/music technology community cdm1 highly praised Tian’s 
design: “The synth is essentially two connected designs. The main synth console 
features organ-like push-button timbre controls and rotaries, plus four touch plates 
that respond both to being depressed and to continuous control vertically along the 
surface…It’ll make you immediately wonder why a single ribbon design is so popular, 
when the ability to finger multiple ribbons, fretless style, both relates to traditional 
instrument designs and allows more sophisticated melodic playing and expression…” 
[5]. Image 1 shows the design of Tian’s Xian Kong Qin and him playing the instrument, 
featured on the cover of WXD’s Vol.1980, No.3.

Through this prototype, Tian emulated a broad range of Chinese traditional music 
instruments’ timbres as well as used different electronic music techniques to design 
abstract sounds for film scoring and soundtracks, as demonstrated in Video 1.  This is 
also the first Chinese synthesizer that had ever been designed and made in Chinese 
music history. 
In 1979, Tian brought this prototype to Beijing for experts’ review. His original 
thoughts were to make it low-cost and broad distribution, so this instrument could be 
adopted by the general public and really shine for novel musical expressions. However, 
the music factory that was assigned to collaborate with him wanted to make a fortune 
out of this design. The factory upgraded the bodywork of the prototype and made it 
look more like a Western organ. Meanwhile, the cost became unaffordable. Because of 
the cost and some other political reasons that Tian would not want to dig deep into 
during the unusual historical period of time, only four copies of the instrument were 
made and distributed to the major four national film companies for film scoring.
In 1980, Tian founded China's first professional electronic musical instrument research 
institute in Taiyuan, Shanxi province. There, Tian continued his NIME innovations and 
built a series of NIMEs to promote Chinese traditional instruments and folk music. 
Some of these inventions include an electronic Banhu, electronic Yueqin, electronic

Guzheng, and electronic Yangqin, just to name a few. He also holds 40 patents and 
wrote the first scholarly book on electronic music instruments’ history and music 
interface/sound effects design techniques in the Chinese language [6]. 
Although none of his brilliant inventions received commercial success or international 
recognition due to the political reasons stated above and the relatively closed society 
before the Internet era in China, Tian has been respected and known by today’s 
Chinese music technology community as “the father of China’s own synthesizer.”
Meng Qi: The Unity of Form and Matter in NIME 
Born in Beijing in the 1980s, Mengqi has gained significant recognition since the 
2010s as a Chinese pioneer NIME designer. He designed many modular synthesizers 
as well as gesture-controlled digital music instruments (DMI) and audio effects. In 
2007, as a college dropout with an unfinished German major, he discovered his true 
passion for building music gadgets.  He was fascinated by the endless possibilities of 
electroacoustic sound design. Discovering new sounds and their unexpected power to 
catch humans off guard has been his ultimate goal ever since.
In 2011, Meng started making electronic music instruments. Without any electrical 
engineering background, he self-taught himself everything, from circuit soldering and 
assembling to embedded coding. In 2014, he tried his hand at building Voltage 
Memory, which was a Eurorack analog sequencer controller, and sold about 300 units 
within a year. It was good-looking, multifunctional, small-sized, affordable, and easy to 
use. Although many modular synths nowadays are manufactured in China, this little 
blue box was the first China’s own Eurorack module, designed and built by a Chinese 
citizen. Image 2 shows the interface design of the Voltage Memory.

Besides making Eurorack modules, he was more interested in making standalone 
DMIs. He designed and built more than 30 different models and sold thousands of 
units over the years. Each of them was given an elegant and easy-to-use intuitive user 
interface. Just like a piece of art, these human-centered NIMEs are well-designed, 
sophisticated, gorgeous-sounding/looking, and holistic. 
For example, his favorite older design Magnet Matrix2 (2016), shown in Image 3, was 
designed for deterministic patching. Patching quickly and effortlessly with the well-
designed magnet pins and touch, this piece is a wonderful improvisational tool for 
musicians to explore the random unknown between noise and musical sounds, 
sequence and chaos, as well as sonic stability and turbulence. As Meng explains: 
“Through the exploratory patching process on this instrument, users gradually turn 
their conscious mind to subconsciousness, building muscle memory and neural 
feedback between the user and the instrument.”

Meng builds and performs his DMIs from an Eastern aesthetic and philosophical 
approach. His latest design, Wing Pinger3 (2020), shown in Image 4, is an analog-
digital hybrid musical instrument that merges sonic chaos and organized sounds 
through a highly optimized continuous control interface, to achieve sonic versatility 
and music expressions. Since Wing Pinger entered the market in 2020 during the 
pandemic, it has already sold 300 units. 
This design comes from the Daoist philosophy of Hun Dun ( 混沌 ) – a non-dual view that 
is similar to Buddhist philosophy, which welcomes all kinds of possibilities, 
randomness, chaos, and order [7]. Meng said, “Interface design is the core of today’s 
cutting-edge DMI design. The sonic output and the interface grow together in my mind 
at the very beginning of the design process. They are the cause and effect of each 
other. Similar to chaos and order/control, here, we are not distinguishing one from the 
other because they are ultimately the same. Depending on where the control weights 
in, the result with more of the user’s intention is so-called ‘control’, while the one with 
more of the machine’s algorithm is so-called ‘chaos’. My preference has always been a 
‘controlled chaos,’ where human and machine work as a non-dual being.”

 His current DMI design-in-progress, Horizon, is a collaboration with American 
NIMEer Trent Gill4. Meng explains that together they “aim to design a DMI that not 
only freely creates novel sonic phenomena; but more importantly, allows the 
performance interface to form bonds with the user through the real-time intuitive 
feedback… There are metaphors, ingenuity, aesthetics, and even playfulness that Trent 
and I have personalized in our design.” 
The core structure of Horizon is based on Wing Pinger, adding on three sets of new 
resonators and filters. A complex audio loopback/feedback system is realized to 
simulate the sounds in nature. On the interface, Meng and Trent use tides, water 
currents, rain, and birdsong as visual elements to form an ecosystem with minimal 
graphical instructions. All time-related parameters such as equipment occupancy and 
frequency/voltage controls in multiples are controlled by dividing natural frequency.
Meng came up with this system architecture when he was realizing Wing Pinger, with 
the intent of allowing users to quickly switch between noise and musical 
phrases/motifs. Combined with an intuitive interface design, Meng and Trent aim to

establish a new human-machine relationship that is non-dual for musicians to explore 
novel expressions in both instrumental and vocal performances. To sum it up in one 
sentence from Trent’s quote: “Horizon is an instrument to push and be pushed back, 
navigating chaos and embodied state.” Audio 1 is a proof-of-concept improvisational 
electroacoustic piece, Untitled, by Meng, for voice, Wing Pinger, and Wingie (2020). 
Wingie, shown in Image 5, is a portable multifunctional stereo resonator that Meng 
built5. Its core circuit design will be included in the new collaborative system with 
Trent. Meng also uses Wingie to generate meditation music in his leisure time.

Perfectly aligned with the Eastern philosophy, Meng describes his design thinking as a 
“unity of form and matter.” He said: “Stockhausen stated in one of his lectures back in 
the 1960s that the barrier between form and matter [8] had been removed by modern 
technology, which contributes to ‘the unity in electronic music’ [9]. I would argue that 
it is also true in DMI design. With the rapid technology development, DMIs have 
become irreplaceable for composition – music made with one DMI will likely not be 
possible with other ones. From this perspective, matter and form have been unified in 
DMI design.” In other words, the materials, sonic, circuit, and interface design 
determine the DMI itself and how the DMI can be performed (virtuosity) and composed 
(creativity). They are an inseparable whole.
In recent years, Meng has been invited to teach creative coding and NIME design in 
many Chinese art institutions, such as the Beijing Contemporary Music Academy, 
Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts, and Central Academy of Fine Arts. Being an icon in the 
Chinese NIME field, Meng continues to output his understanding of DMI design, music 
aesthetics, and NIME theories through his Wechat official account “Synthetic 
Minority6.” It is his hope that his teachings, theoretical concepts, and music practices 
can inspire more people and help build a stronger Chinese NIME community where 
innovation and originality strive.
Discussion
This research mainly focuses on documenting the interview contexts, understanding 
the interviewees’ perspectives, as well as briefly introducing the cultural and historical 
backgrounds of the interviewees and their work. More research can be done to further 
study the Chinese NIME community. For example, what is the relationship between 
NIME academic research and commercial music technology development in China? 
What are the challenges and opportunities presented to contemporary Chinese 
NIMEers in general? How about gender diversity? The author sincerely welcomes 
other scholars to join this discussion and envision the future of the Chinese NIME 
community as a whole.
Conclusions
These two in-depth case studies construct a brief yet vivid montage of yesterday and 
today’s Chinese NIME community in a historical context. Offering first-hand life 
stories, anecdotes, and insightful reflections on the creative practice and technical 
overview, these narratives position individuals within as well as beyond the boundaries

of their times and places. They shed new light on the constantly evolving constructions 
of the world of Chinese electronic/electroacoustic music and the NIME community.
Acknowledgments
My heartfelt gratitude to the interviewees for their precious time and 
photo/video/audio courtesy. Thanks to the University of Colorado Denver’s Office of 
Research Services (ORS), College of Arts and Media (CAM), Center for Faculty 
Development and Advancement (CFDA), and Center for Excellence in Teaching and 
Learning (CETL) for their funding support.
Ethics Statement
This research involves human interviewees who provided the author with their full 
consent and generous support. The participants were selected because of their historic 
achievements in the Chinese NIME community. Currently, there is no scholarly work in 
English has been done to reflect their work. Chinese NIME community has been 
thriving in recent years and documenting its history is important non-
eurocentric/inclusive scholarly work to decolonize our field.  No animals were involved 
in this study. The source of funding for this research is non-commercial. It is from the 
author’s research institution. Since Meng Qi sells his NIMEs, there might be a minor 
conflict of interest financially with others, which is out of the scope of this research.  
Instead, the author focuses mainly on analyzing Meng’s HCI design work as well as 
aesthetic and philosophical pursuits, as he is the iconic Chinese NIMEer and the first 
Chinese Eurorack designer.
