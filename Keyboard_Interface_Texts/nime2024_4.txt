ABSTRACT 
This paper describes the creation of a NIME, Rheostat Rotary Rack 
(RRR), based on a rotary drying rack. Part of the Women's Labor 
feminist project that creates Embedded Acoustic Instruments using old 
domestic tools, RRR is anchored by a base that acts as resonator for the 
system and includes sensors—potentiometers (rheostats) and a rotary 
encoder—embedded into its physical architecture. RRR detects the 
weight of hanging clothes and velocity of rotation by hand or wind. 
Motivated by the feminist concept of reproductive commons, we 
invite the public to do and witness communal housework in interactive 
installation and musical performance, in order to challenge gender 
inequality in domestic work division. A composition written for RRR, 
A Body of Resistance, draws upon quotes by rheostat inventor Mary 
Hallock-Greenewalt to address women's struggles for equal treatment. 
The sound designs for RRR and A Body of Resistance take inspiration 
from the drying rack’s original wind-powered utility, using aerophone 
sounds and vibrational modelling of pipes and bars. By reimagining 
domestic tools with embedded technologies, we envision a musical 
housework commons that can act as a catalyst for social change.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Rheostat Rotary Rack (RRR) is the second instrument of  
Women’s Labor, a feminist project conceptualized and directed 
by Ho  that repurposes old domestic tools with embedded 
technologies to make new Embedded Acoustic Instruments  
(EADs) [19]. Catapulting domestic tools that belong to the 
private sphere into public spotlight, Women’s Labor challenges 
the global gender inequality in unpaid housework division [20]. 
The domestic -tool-turned musical instruments are featured in 
installations, new compositions by women composers [8], [9], 
[12], [18], and performances. While Schedel has been part of 
Women’s Labor since its inception  to design, compos e, and 
perform with the instruments, Jacobs was approached to help 
with engineering and fabricating the RRR. This paper focuses on 
the design and construction of RRR (Figure 1) that is based on 
the Australian Hills Hoist Dryer, an outdoor drying rack with an 
in-built rotating mechanism that spins by hand and in the wind.  
1.1 MOTIVATION 
Housework, often performed in isolation within the confines of 
one's home, remains largely invisible to the public eye. From a 
socialist-feminist perspective, th e isolation and invisibility of 
unpaid “reproductive labor” (including caregiving and domestic 
work) perpetuates women’s oppression in a capitalist framework 
[3]. In parts of Latin America, women have formed non -
capitalist modes of production by turning public spaces  into 
grassroots organised hubs  called “reproductive commons ,” 
communally doing reproductive work such as cooking, caring 
for children, playing music, and running political education 
events [4]. These  acts of political and social resistance build 
solidarity and strength , r eorganizing and sociali zing domestic 
work and thereby the home and neighbourhood to counter the 
capitalist “atomisation” of singular family units. 
  Expanding upon this practice of reproductive commons, we 
use the Hills Hoist Dryer , an exemplary  household tool within 
Ho’s social setting in contemporary suburban Australia. The 
Hills Hoist Dryer captures the friction between the public and the 
domestic, and the individual and  the communal. Listed as a 
National Treasure in the National Library of Australia  [15] and 
featured in the 2000 Sydney Olympics opening ceremony, it is a 
national, public icon of an idealized, suburban domestic life [11]. 
Within the community , the  dryer is found ubiquitously in 
backyards of not only individual household units, but also in 
communal living settings in Australia, including social housing 
units in Ho’s neighborhood. RRR repurposes the Hills Hoist 
Dryer to be used in a “housework commons, ” challenging its 
symbolized ideal of suburban bliss that conceals the exploitation 
of women's unpaid labor behind gender -normative roles.  The 
Hills Hoist Dryer has been featured in film [10],[13], sculpture 
[17], and photograph y [1]; departing from its artistic use as 
visual text, RRR is an expressive, gestural instrument, taking a 
new approach by augmenting the human actions of hanging 
laundry with sound. In interactive installation of RRR, the public 
participates in house-working in which all genders and ages are 
invited to sonically meditate on the act of hang their own and 
others’ clothes. Their sound performance becomes a social 
performance, in which laundering becomes a de-gendered 
activity for all. RRR also defies the traditional gendering of 
technology as masculine  [16] by foregrounding a domestic , 
traditionally feminized technological innovation. By 
reimagining domestic technologies with  new technologies, we 
shed light on them as undervalued technological inventions and 
question the feminization of housework. 
 
2. RHEOSTAT ROTARY RACK  
Ho has conceptualized the performativity of the EADs in 
Women’s Labor to complement each other, such that they can 
become a suite of instruments for  which theatrically-oriented 
compositions interrogating gendered inequality can be 
commissioned. While the performative gestures of the first

instrument, Embedded Iron, are downward and two-dimensional 
on the ironing board  [19], those of RRR—hanging clothes onto 
its strings and rotating it either by hand or by wind—are upward 
and three-dimensional. 
  The two instruments are  also designed to have contrasting 
sound concepts. Whereas Embedded Iron’s noisy, electric guitar 
pedal effects in its audio synthesis evoke the original, searing hot 
working conditions, RRR’s sound design alludes to wind drying, 
referencing the sounds of aeolian harps by  using samples  of 
aerophones: rubbing the rims of wine glasses and spinning 
whirly tubes.  Both RRR and Embedded Iron  are designed to  
contain resonators within their instrument bod ies. Embedded 
Iron is fitted with a transducer and a speaker on the underside of 
the ironing board as resonator . While  panning is two -
dimensional on the ironing board, RRR has a base that serves as 
a resonator for 8 channels of audio diffused through all six sides 
of the box  (Figure 2). Two channels are connected to low 
frequency transducers facing down, four go to mid -range 
speakers facing out, and two are directed up through high -
frequency tweeters, allowing for 360-degree spatialization. 
 
2.1 Physical Construction and Sensing 
RRR is constructed to evoke the architecture of the original Hills 
Hoist Drye r. T he anatomy of RRR consists of three main 
segments: the branches, the trunk, and the base, constructed 
using 3D printed parts, PVC pipes  and steel couplers , and a 
custom-made wooden box  (see Fig ure 1). In total, Jacobs 
designed twelve custom 3D-printed structural components. The 
four branches create four quadrants; each quadrant supports one 
inner and one outer string on which fabric can be hung by the 
performer or public participant. Each branch is supported by an 
arm that connects it to the top of the trunk . This stability 
reinforcement taken from the Hills Hoist Dryer’s structural 
design minimizes undesired displacement that could result in 
unwanted noise in the sensor signals. While the Hills Hoist Dryer 
is conventionally set into the ground  using conc rete mix , the 
light-weight materials anchored by the wooden box allows RRR 
to be easily transportable so that Housework Commons can be  
installed at different sites.  
Our choice of sensors is informed by Ho’s aesthetic vision 
of correlating  the instrumental affordances of the Women’s 
Labor EADs with the domestic tools’ original affordances. The 
quotidian actions that one makes with the Hills Hoist Dryer —
hanging clothes and spinning the rack  to access other 
quadrants—become precisely the instrumental gestures of RRR, 
such that these natural actions of domestic work become the site 
of interrogation through augmenting them with sound. For this 
purpose, we selected two types of sensors—potentiometers and 
a rotary encoder —to fit into th e physical  construction. A 
potentiometer measures the weight applied to each string  when 
a performer or public participant hangs a piece of fabric.  Two 
custom, 3D-printed parts were required for th is weight-sensing 
mechanism— one to mount the potentiometer to the branch, and 
another to attach the string to the potentiometer. A spring is used 
to return the potentiometer to its original position once the 
weight applied to the string is removed.  
Signals from the potentiometers are sent down the trunk to 
the base and interpreted by a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller (Figure 
3). These signals are ultimately used to modify audio synthesis 
generated in Pure Data, running on a Raspberry Pi.  Connecting 
the potentiometers to the Pi is complicated by the rotational 
motion of the trunk through an opening in the base. This motion 
would ordinarily result in wires becoming tangled; however we 
used an ESP8266 microcontroller to transmit potentiometer data 
to the Pi wirelessly. This allows  for free spinning of RRR, 
without limitation on the number of rotations. Jacobs created a  
custom circuit board to facilitate the connection of the 
potentiometers through the Teensy to the ESP8266.

The second instrumental gesture of spinning the branches of 
RRR is implemented through a  high-resolution rotary encoder 
that measures the rotational motion of the trunk. A 3D -printed 
component was created to mount the encoder to the base,  
allowing the encoder’s shaft to couple with the trunk when 
inserted through an opening in the top of the base. Five 3D -
printed components were needed to stabilize the trunk, mount 
bearings, secure the encoder, and mount the Teensy/ESP8266 
board and accompanying power supply. 
  The majority of the electrical components are housed in the 
base that also acts as a resonator.  RRR was designed to conceal 
the electrical components in order to direct attention away from 
the technical intricacies, and towards the performative and 
sculptural capabilities of the instrument.  
 
2.2 Adaptable Sound-Gesture Mapping 
RRR’s overarching mapping concept can be summarized as 
follows: 1) hanging clothes on a string triggers wine glass 
sounds, with the pitch and timbre determined by the clothing’s 
weight and specific string activated; and 2) rotating RRR triggers 
whirly tube sounds that change pitch based on  rotational 
velocity. The mapping of gesture to pitch is designed to be easily 
adaptable from composition to composition so that composers 
are not limited by pre-chosen pitch class sets. A simple 6x17 grid 
of frequencies populates the synthesis engine  in Pure Data , 
shown in Table 1.  Given the wine glass and whirly tube samples 
(Column 2) , the composer dictates the pitch es they desire by 
altering the “Fundamental” frequency (Column 3) and the three 
“Overtones” (Columns 4 -6). The rows indicate the strings, in 
which the first number denotes the quadrant of the instrument . 
Letter ‘a’ denotes the outside string in the quadrant and letter ‘b’, 
the inside string. Each string has two sets of frequencies that are 
mapped to lighter and heavier weights of the material hung on 
the line , denoted by .1 or .2  respectively. For example, the 
outside string of the first quadrant has two frequency sets, listed 
in rows 1a.1 and 1a.2.  Using this grid, t he PD patch calculates 
the transposition from the  sample frequencies. Once the 
composer ha s selected their pitch design, i t is simple to load 
these settings in a CSV file with a thumb drive and a small screen 
inside the base of the instrument.  
  When the performer hangs a fabric on a string, one of the 
two Fundamentals will sound (depending on its weight). 
Rotating RRR creates sustained audio; Overtones 1 –3 are then 
activated by spinning the structure faster and faster, as it reaches 
three threshold velocities.

3. ORIGINAL COMPOSITION 
Ho commissioned Schedel to write  the first commissioned 
composition for RRR, A Body of Resistance. The piece uses 
quotes by British/Syrian musician and inventor Mary Hallock -
Greenewalt (1871-1950), from her writings and patent 
application [5] for a sensitive , non-linear rheostat that she 
invented for her audio/visual performances with piano.  Before 
Hallock-Greenewalt’s invention, rheostats were highly stepped; 
with her innovation light could “be increased or decreased at will 
by the least perceptible increments ” [6]. She holds eleven 
patents; for this composition quotes from her patent simply titled 
“Rheostat” were used. Impressively, she successfully defended 
her patent against General Electric, who contended that a woman 
could not possibly devise such a sophisticated invention [2]. The 
title of the composition alludes to the continuous acts of 
resistance women must perform to achieve equality. 
 Schedel’s aunt, Kathleen Kadis,  embroidered seventeen 
banners with the titles of the instrument and project, piece name, 
and quotes from Hallock-Greenewalt onto multi-colored banners 
(Figure 4). She made each banner from a different fabric , with 
distinct lengths and widths. Because the banners were too close 
in weight to be readable by the potentiometers when added 
cumulatively to a string , Schedel sewed fishing weights into 
some of the banner s. This modification ensures that sound is

triggered for each banner when a succession of them are added 
to a string.  
 In the performance, the performer  hangs the banners and 
rotates RRR in different sequences. Each banner contains a name 
or phrase , one of four  quadrant number s, and instructions for 
how fast to spin or stop the rotation. The first four ‘reference’ 
banners are pre -determined and their placement dictates the 
quadrant numbers. Each of the ‘reference’ banners becomes an 
indication point—the ‘Women’s Labor ’ banner becomes 
quadrant one. Each of the ‘reference’ banners has a distinct 
color, making it easy to place subsequent fabric s in the right 
position. The performer has the choice of hanging the ‘reference’ 
banners on the inside or outside string.  After these, a random 
number generator dictates the order with which the rest of the 
banners should be hung.  
 The performer adopts a meditative demeanor, playing A Body 
of Resistance  at a markedly slow pace. At the outset of the 
performance, all banners are pinned with numbered safety pins 
to a large brass shield, originally used in the military for sorting 
laundry. The performer selects a banner based on a randomizer, 
detaches it from the shield, and positions it on the designated 
quadrant before either spinning or halting the RRR rotation. 
Schedel herself premiered A Body of Resistance  in an outdoor 
venue on New York City's Governors Island  [7]. Excitingly, 
during the performance, the wind was strong enough to rotate the 
rack and serve as an unpredictable duet partner. 
 
3.1 Compositional Sound Design 
Extending RRR’s wind-powered sound concept , the sound 
design of A Body of Resistance is inspired by vibrations of pipes 
and bars. Table 1 shows the frequencies chosen by Schedel for 
the piece. The secondary set of pitches  associated with heavier 
fabrics are higher, inspired by the jump in pitch when a pipe is 
overblown. The pitches are not random; Schedel chose the 
fundamental frequencies for the eight strings to create two 
contrasting chords: one chord for all lightweight fabrics, and 
another for heavier fabrics. In the performance, as the performer 
adds fabrics, the sound slowly moves from one chord to another.  
The timbre for the sound is determined by the  fundamental 
frequency and its overtones . Schedel chose each quadrant to 
correlate to a different kind of physical model —from an open 
pipe to a clamped bar.  An open pipe is a musical instrument that 
is open at both ends , such as a flute or an organ pipe . When an 
open pipe is played, it resonates at its fundamental frequency and 
at whole-number multiples of that fundamental frequency. On 
the other hand, a  clamped bar is a bar fixed at one end, such as 
tuning fork . When struck, it also vibrates and produces a 
fundamental frequency along with its overtones. However, the 
overtone series for a clamped bar is more complex than that of 
an open pipe. The overtone frequencies are not whole -number 
multiples of the fundamental frequenc y; instead, they occur at 
frequencies that are  irregular, fractional  multiples of the 
fundamental frequency [14]. While the tuning fork’s timbre is 
similar to that of a simple sine wave because of its sparse and 
muted overtones, the amplified overtones  of the clamped -bar 
model on RRR leads to a more dissonant sound.  
 
4. FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
To expand upon  RRR’s wind-powered concept , e mploying 
physical modeling synthesis to simulate the acoustics of an open 
tube may allow for a more nuanced translation from sensors to 
sound generation.  We will add  more percussive, plucking 
timbres of bending the corrugated ridges and furrows of whirly 
tubes to complement the current drone-like sound design. We 
have begun mapping different velocities and durations of whirly-
tube bending to hanging fabrics of different weights. Mapping a 
decisive, plucking sound gesture to hanging clothes accentuates 
and foregrounds this unremarkable action of laundering.  
The next stage of the  physical construction of RRR will 
involve further refinement of its aesthetics and  extension of its  
playability. Extending the branches to allow for five strings per 
quadrant, mimicking the Hills Hoist Dryer , will allow us to 
create more pitch, timbral, and textural possibilities. Adding an 
option to adjust the height of RRR will enable the inclusion of 
players of different heights  and abilities. The structural rigidity 
and durability of some physical components could be 
reexamined should the project budget  expand in the future. 
Material such as aluminum, while more expensive to 
manufacture, may prove to be a better choice than 3D-printed 
PLA parts for connecting joints.

5. CONCLUSION 
Rheostat Rotary Rack invites the public to participate in and 
witness housework as public performance, thereby reimagining 
and revaluing domestic work as communal labor. Apart from 
creating individual compositions for these NIMEs, we encourage 
composers to write music for small chamber ensemble s that 
blends these NIMEs with acoustic instruments  and theatrical 
components.  Through the public’s participation in interactive 
installation, it is our vision that a musical housework commons 
will lead to future soc ially-engaged collaborations that can 
inspire social and political action.
