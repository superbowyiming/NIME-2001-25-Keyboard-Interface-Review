ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present the outcome of a musical work-
shop on accessibility of graphic scores for blind people, held
in Brescia, Italy with the support of Unione Italiana dei
Ciechi e degli Ipovedenti ETS - APS 1 (UIC). Through a se-
ries of meetings and side-by-side study sessions, four blind
musicians were involved in a collective musical experiment,
culminating in a final concert based on three pieces from
the historical repertoire. During these meetings, a series
of semi-structured interviews with the participants allowed
us to collect a series of guidelines and suggestions regard-
ing the design and creation of tactile scores and to discuss
performance strategies, in order to facilitate accessibility of
this peculiar repertoire to visually impaired people.

1. INTRODUCTION
In recent times, the topic of accessibility has become in-
creasingly central to research, reflecting a growing aware-
ness of the importance of inclusivity in different human ac-
tivities. According to the World Health Organization, at
least 2.2 billions people suffer from some kind of visual im-
pairments, and around 40 millions are blind. These numbers
are likely to almost double by 2050 [8].
Since most interfaces and musical notation systems are based
on symbolic abstractions of visual nature, it is necessary to

develop new means to facilitate access to musical expressive-
ness and creativity for Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI)
people. With the progress of studies in the field of Human-
Computer Interaction (HCI), new technologies, interfaces
and tools have been successfully deployed. Many innovative
researches relies on haptic or vibro-tactile feedback convey-
ing non-visual information, and their practical application
has been investigated towards educational purposes [19, 20],
assistance to composing or editing [24, 26, 30], and musical
performances [5, 31].
Regarding musical notation, being Braille the standard read-
ing/writing system specifically designed for BVI people, sev-
eral protocols for translation from music notation to Music
Braille Code (MBC) [3] have been proposed (e.g. [11, 15,
14]), along with softwares for automatic Braille music scan
and acquisition (e.g. [6]). However, besides being difficult
to learn, read, and translate, as suggested by several re-
searches such as [22, 23], MBC is prone to a number of prob-
lems due to its poor flexibility. Moreover, during the XX
century, Western musical semiography has been enriched
with a plethora of new symbols, given the need for com-
posers to represent on the scores increasingly subtle musi-
cal parameters, extended techniques, or electronic sounds,
for which traditional notation proved inadequate. A pecu-
liar case of such semiographic experiences is constituted by
graphic scores [10, 28]. Often related to aleatoric music,
such scores imply the adoption of visual and geometric ele-
ments underlying musical structures and gestures. They do
not represent precise musical parameters, rather provide a
set of high-level abstractions which can be interpreted fol-
lowing a set of given instructions: therefore, executions of
the same piece could be quite dissimilar. Because of their
intrinsic nature, graphic scores are not only a form of nota-
tion, but also constitute a form of visual art by themselves,
which cannot be fully appreciated by the sole listening of
their audio counterpart: as such, BVI people are excluded
from access this repertoire.
To initiate a discussion on the accessibility of graphic scores,
in this paper we propose the design of tactile supports based
on three scores from the literature. Throughout a four-day
workshop with four blind musicians, we collected feedback
and suggestion about design improvements, and evaluate
their effectiveness and practical implications during side-
by-side study sessions, rehearsals, and a final concert.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Graphic Scores
Graphic scores are a form of musical notation highly influ-
enced by visual art, representing high-level musical events
that are pseudo-random or impossible to notate otherwise.
Indeed, such scores often deals with musical gestures rather
than precise sounds, and provide indications and formal
development for musical performances, generally expressed
through the use of geometric shapes or abstract symbols,
along with several preliminary instructions.
Graphic scores became popular around the 50s thanks to the
works of Earle Brown, who consider standard notation as
“a relatively inefficient and incomplete transcription of the
infinite totality which a composer traditionally hears” [28].
Other noticeable examples are Schafer Epitaph for Moon-
light (1968), where graphical objects constitutes a sort of
guidance for choir improvisation, Maderna’s Serenata per
un Satellite (1969), in which standard notation is present
but arranged in a way that its displacement, describing tra-
jectories in space, acquires an additional semantic function;
or interactive scores such as Fontana Mix (1958) by John
Cage and Ink Bops (2017) by Ellen Burr, where the aleatoric
combination of individual elements results in ever-evolving
musical structures.
Due to their effectiveness in graphically describing musical
movements within a composition, they can also take on the
function of ‘descriptive scores’ [12], often applied to com-
puter music: an example being the accompanying visual
score created by Rainer Wehinger [18] on Gyorgy Ligeti’s
Artikulation (1958).
Being unique works of visual art per se, their fruition is
strictly linked to being seen. Furthermore, the interpreta-
tive freedom often delegated to the players, combined with
the absence of a univocal sign-sound correspondence, makes
it almost impossible to fully appreciate the composer’s in-
tent simply by listening to an execution. Therefore, BVI
people cannot access graphic scores in their native form:
this motivated our research on tactile supports.
2.2 Accessibility of Music Notation
The literature regarding music notation for BVI people mostly
deals with the direct transcription of Common Western Mu-
sic Notation (CWMN) into Music Braille Code (MBC) [3]
compliant with the Unified English Braille (UEB) [29] stan-
dard. In Braille music notation, pitches and durations are
encoded into a standard Braille cell (six embossed dots in
a 2x3 matrix), along with other specific encoding for clefs,
time signatures, accidentals, dynamics, etc. This process is
quite time-consuming and traditionally carried out by ex-
perts [1] requiring specific preparation [2].
As such, several methods and protocols for automating such
translation have been proposed. For instance, [14, 15] rely
on the MusicXML [13] encoding to automatically operate
the translations via software and improve portability. Ef-
forts to enhance the accessibility of music notation have also
been made on the input side: for instance, in [4] the au-
thors proposed an open-source interface for rendering both
CWMN and MBC in the browser along with auditory feed-
back; the last release of MuseScore2 provides typing support
for Braille notation; innovative hardware with improved ac-
cess surfaces to facilitate the music writing have been re-
cently introduced [27].
However, such works are centered on CWMN: besides forms
2https://musescore.org/
of traditional notations belonging to non-western cultures
still being clearly underrepresented [17], there is a profound
lack of researches oriented towards the accessibility of non-
conventional notations, with only few performance-oriented
experiences relying on audio or tactile triggers, and mu-
sicians’ interplay (e.g. [25]). To the best of our knowl-
edge, only Karpodini & Michailidis [16] explicitly include
graphic scores: in Logothetis Sound, they extrapolated sev-
eral shapes from the score of Anestis Logothetis’ Odysee
(1963) into 3D-printed objects which can be explored via
interactive sonification.
As such, with this paper we aim to encourage debate on
possible solutions to fill this gap.
3. METHODOLOGY
The experience here presented was structured in the form
of a four-days, in-person workshop hosted by UIC in Bres-
cia, Italy. The meetings were led by the first author of this
paper, who has a strong background in twentieth-century
compositional practices. In order to provide the partici-
pants with practical perspectives and an enriching experi-
ence, during the last day we organized an informal concert
based on three historical scores analyzed during the work-
shop.
The four attendants were all volunteers, all of them were
blind from birth, the average age was 50,5. Three of them
were professional musicians, one had musical studies as am-
ateur. None of them had previous experience with graphic
scores. The resulting ensemble consisted of piano, trumpet,
voice and accordion.
Suggestions and comments from the participants were col-
lected in a series of semi-structured interview or emerged
from spontaneous moment of discussion during the days
spent together, from which we extracted relevant themes
according to Braun & Clarke’s [7] thematic analysis. The
dialogues have been transcribed and progressively harmo-
nized into themes, reported in Section 4.
3.1 The Scores
During the workshop, we worked on three graphic scores
from the historical repertoire: a selection of six pages (130-
135) from Treatise (1967) by Cornelius Cardew; Decem-
ber ’52 (1952) by Earle Brown; and Gingko (2007) by Jon
Raskin.
In order to allow the participants to access the graphic
repertoire, we relied on 3D-printed supports representing
the original scores, which they can touch and explore freely.
For the production of supports, we digitally screened the
original scores, converted into .svg format, extruded as 3D
files, and printed. We used Linearity Curve 3 for .svg con-
version, and Blender 4 for 3D modelling. We printed the
scores in PETG/PLA - a hard, enduring, and recyclable
material. For the final supports, we adopted an A5 format
with standard 0.6mm Braille measure for the extruded parts
(comments about previous prototypes and why we choose
these sizes are reported in Section 4). Each score have been
provided with a guide file containing indications from the
composers (where present) along with examples and sugges-
tions for their interpretation. The final supports are shown
in Figure 1.

elements (lines, squares, circles) on a white background. An
empty double staff lies on the bottom of the page for the
whole length of the score. There are no indication about
instrumentation or possible interpretations of the shapes.
Given its geometric nature, in our rendering we simply ex-
truded the various elements.
In December ’52, for one or more instruments and/or sound-
producing media, the composer imagines an exploration of
a 3D space, allowing the musician to move in any direction
from any point. The score shows 28 rectangles of different
width and length, defining musical parameter such as pitch,
dynamics, duration, and proximity. In our design, the sense
of depth was rendered through five different thicknesses, in
this case increased by 1mm each to compensate for the rar-
efaction of the elements.
The score of Gingko, for various instrumentation, is com-
posed of a wooden piece with inlay lines surrounded by five
ginkgo leaves, with dots and lines leaning their stems to the
wooden element. A sixth leaf lays on the bottom of the
score, disconnected from the central piece. According to
the composer, the musicians arbitrarily assign a sound to
each dot and follow the connections provided by the lines.
The central element represents a group improvisation. In
this case, we slightly simplified the drawing, reporting the
leaves’ contours without internal textures.
3.2 The Workshop
Day 1-2 and 3-4 were grouped together, with a one-month
break in between. The four meetings were organized as fol-
lows.
During the first day, we provided a brief historical introduc-
tion about aleatoric music and graphic scores, focusing on
the evolution of the literature from the XX century to nowa-
days. Given the participants’ musical background, this in-
troduction aimed at bridging the gap between their familiar
repertoire and the new one. Therefore, we listened and an-
alyzed some historical pieces from the literature, discussing
ways to decode the scores and how to interact as an ensem-
ble. The lack of any kind of transcription for the analyzed
repertoire made us rely on verbal description of what the
scores represented. In the last part of the meeting, we dis-
cussed several initial 3D-printed score prototypes, designed
based to Braille standards and of different sizes, asking the
participants for feedback to improve our design according
to their haptic habit (see Section 4).
After such preliminary evaluation, the second meeting was
focused on the exploration of the tactile supports. In this
phase, we’re interested in refining our design and evaluate
the effectiveness of the supports, identifying common prob-
lems which can occur and possible solutions according to the
participants’ experience. As such, we discussed clarity, res-
olution, and portability in both studying and performance
scenarios. At the end of the meeting, we planned a short
rehearsal with the musicians in order to make them com-
fortable with the repertoire from a practical perspective.
Between the second and the third meeting, we first final-
ized the design of the 3D printed score following the par-
ticipants’ feedback and suggestions. Then, we provided the
musicians with personal copies of each scores and guide files,
so they could study individually at their pace. During the
one-month break, we kept in contact with them, providing
support for their study and discussing strategies for mem-
orizing and performing. We also organized individual re-
hearsal in which the musician played their parts along with
a piano accompaniment. This helped them to be more con-
fident with the new repertoire.
In the third meeting, the musicians rehearsed the pieces
together. At this stage, we simply guided the executions
and stimulate the discussion regarding strategies they used
during the individual study, encountered difficulties, and
musical ideas emerged from the scores, with particular fo-
cus on the use of the provided supports.
Finally, in the last day we had a general rehearsal (Figure
2) and properly set the stage for the concert scheduled for
the same evening. We asked the participants for some gen-
eral remarks on the whole experience. The concert was held
in the presence of musicians’ relative and friends and UIC
personnel; we summarized the experience and introduced
the repertoire.
4. THE MUSICIAN’S PERSPECTIVE
In this section, we report the outcome of the thematic anal-
ysis over the discussions emerged during the experience.
Themes are reported in bold, and direct quotes has been
translated in English from the original Italian, with the four
participants referred as P1, P2, P3, P4. For the purpose of
this paper, we only report themes concerning the the tactile
supports, their design, and their practical implications.
During the first and second meetings, we focused on the de-

sign of the supports, asking the participants for direct feed-
back and suggestions. We discussed several prototypes: a
15x9x1cm tile with elements of different tickness, and three
A5, 1mm PLA sheets with respectively 1.5mm, 1mm, and
0.6mm (Braille standard) extruded elements. All the par-
ticipants agreed on the latter being the best. Indeed, while
evaluated as both lightweight and sturdy, this prototype was
also the easiest to read: “the others are too much invasive
to touch” - P1. Based on their daily habits, two musicians
also noticed that the 0.6mm prototype presents a greater
level of details: “having a finer grain, it’s easier to out-
line the individual elements” - P3. However, the musicians
suggest that every design should consider the characteris-
tics of the original score. For instance, in December ’52,
the participants had difficulties in clearly deciphering the
five height levels: therefore, larger incremental thicknesses
(1mm) were necessary to compensate for the rarefaction of
the elements. This impossibility of a priori relying on a
standard due to contextual constraints (also highlighted in
the literature, e.g. [9]) further emerged in relation to the
size of the supports: although the A4 format is the most
used, the musicians agreed on using smaller sheets: “in the
case of proposed scores, [..] it’s easier to manage a more
compact surface” - P2.
When asked about a comparison of the supports with the
traditional paper , all the participants preferred the tactile
ones. Being the PLA sheets heavier and more stable, the
reading experience has been evaluated as particularly com-
fortable. Moreover, the possibility of consultation during
the performance has been compared with paper standard
transcription, finding that the portability/handling would
have been more secure while performing. Similarly to what
is reported in [23], one musician suggested the possibility to
“explore new ways for customized music transcription for
blind people based on this same technology” - P1.
During the individual study sessions, the participants com-
mented on the effectiveness of the supports. After becoming
familiar with the scores for a couple of weeks, the partic-
ipants expressed positive comments towards the supports,
defining them as clear and philologically coherent. This was
particularly valuable for us, as we were interested in preserv-
ing the very meaning of these scores as much as possible,
without altering their primary modes of use as in [16]. Being
graphic scores all-in-all visual means, the participants ap-
preciated the 3D rendering, tracing parallelisms with some
previous personal experiences such as “tactile maps in mu-
seums” - P3. Furthermore, they stated that most initial dif-
ficulties do not arose from support-related problems, rather
from unfamiliarity with the repertoire (we argue that also
non-blind musicians experience the same struggle when ap-
proaching graphic notation for the first time). Although
they initially relied heavily on commentary sheets, they
gradually began reading the score directly: “Practice made
the exploration fast and easy” - P4.
Another theme emerged from the discussions while re-
hearsing is the possibility of direct reading while perform-
ing. At first, the response was negative: based on their
usual practice, everyone aimed to rely on mnemonic pat-
terns, “using the tactile score [...] only for studying” - P1.
The main concern was related to the fact that they “need
time to read the entire score to recall the point we’re at”
- P4. However, after some rehearsals all the participants
changed their mind and started to actively use the supports,
acknowledging that the scores provide many information by
themselves - this is in line with the concept of ‘descriptive
score’ [12]. Still, due to the nature of specific instruments,
several impracticality were present: for instance, the trum-
pet player observed that he “need rests in order to follow
the score”, while the pianist could instead read the support
easily while playing with just one hand (Figure 3).
Figure 3: The pianist reading a score while playing.
These practical considerations regarding their need to follow
the scores results in different performative/interpretative
approaches. P4 decided to rely both on mnemonic patterns
and on our supports during the performance. P1 decided
to assign known excerpt from literature to every graphic
elements in order to better recall them (this also resulted
in a sort of cueing for the other players). P2 and P3 used
the support as an overall synopsis of the piece and their
intervention, but opted for better memorizing the rehearsal
recordings.
4.1 Overall Remarks
The overall opinion on the experience was positive and all
the musicians shared the desire to repeat the experience
again. They appreciated the introduction on graphic scores’
literature and the approach to encourage BVI people access-
ing this repertoire. The tactile supports were assessed as ex-
tremely useful: the participants acknowledged it would not
have been possible for them to fully appreciate the proposed
repertoire otherwise. The consideration of their suggestions
and feedback in the design of each score was considered par-
ticularly valuable. The 3D supports also originate curiosity
on the possibility of new ways for music transcription, espe-
cially in relation to their portability and descriptive scores
as high-level piece summaries.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented the design and evaluation pro-
cess of 3D-printed tactile supports in order to allow BVI
people to access graphic scores. By collecting the direct
suggestions and guidelines of four blind musicians through
a practical musical workshop, we were also able to inves-
tigate how they related to the supports in relation to the
historical repertoire. We hope that this work can be a start-
ing point to suggest new solutions to make the many facets
of the musical experience increasingly accessible for every-
body.
