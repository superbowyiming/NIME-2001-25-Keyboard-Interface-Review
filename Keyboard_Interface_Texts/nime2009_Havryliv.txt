Abstract 
The carillon is one of the few instruments that elicit 
s
ophisticated haptic interaction from amateur and 
professional players alike. Like the piano keyboard, the 
velocity of a player’s impact on each carillon key, or 
baton, affects the quality of the resultant tone; unlike the 
piano, each carillon baton returns a different forceq
feedback. Forceqfeedback varies widely from one baton to 
the next across the entire range of the instrument and with 
further idiosyncratic variation from one instrument to 
another. This makes the carillon an ideal candidate for 
haptic simulation. The application of synthesized forceq
feedback based on an analysis of forces operating in a 
typical carillon mechanism offers a blueprint for the design 
of an electronic practice clavier and with it the solution to 
a problem that has vexed carillonists for centuries, namely 
the inability to rehearse repertoire in private. This paper 
will focus on design and implementation of a haptic 
carillon clavier derived from an analysis of the Australian 
National Carillon in Canberra.  
Keywords: Haptics, forceqfeedback, mechanical analysis. 
1. I
ntroduction 
1.1 H aptics in Musical Instruments 
The capacity for haptic interaction has become 
increasingly important in the field of expressive instrument 
design. The ease with which forceqfeedback may be 
incorporated using new sensors and actuators has led to a 
profusion of novel musical instruments that engage the 
sense of touch. O’Modhrain demonstrates that musicians 
rely heavily on haptic interaction with a sound producing 
device, and how novel instruments are often able to ‘train’ 
a performer to anticipate a particular haptic feedback 
produced within the constraints of hardware or software 
[1].  
The expressive application of forceqfeedback has been 
applied in a number of novel instruments, most notably the 
Touchback Piano [2], the VqBow [3], the MIKEY project 
[4], the D’Groove [5] and sound editor [6].  
Haptic designs fall into two categories; the first of these 
replicate or augment the capabilities of conventional 
instruments as demonstrated in work of Gillespie, Nichols , 
O'Modhrain and others; the second includes designs that 
explore and engage with expressive features of new 
technology as summarised in Berdahl, Steiner and Oldham 
[7]. However, few attempts have been made to apply 
haptic principles in realising instrument designs for 
training traditional performers.  
This is due partly to the focus on either augmenting 
conventional instruments or the creation of new ones in 
order to extend the capabilities of electroacoustic 
performance, but principally due to problems associated 
with recreating and simulating traditional instruments. 
These difficulties include gathering information about the 
dynamic performance of a traditional instrument and 
building a satisfactory prototype that has the 'feel' a 
seasoned instrumentalist expects. 
A haptic incarnation of a traditional instrument, built for 
the purpose of practice or honing musicianship skills, must 
perform to the constraints of the real instrument. Further, a 
haptic instrument needs to replicate the visual and 
mechanical characteristics of the manipulandum – the 
point at which haptic interaction occurs between the 
musician and the instrument. 
1.2 The Carillon 
A carillon is a mechanical construction with bells of 
various size played by a carilloneur from a mechanical 
keyboard, or clavier, housed beneath the bell chamber.

The National Carillon in Canberra, located in a tower on 
Aspen Island in Lake Burley Griffin, houses 55 bells 
spanning four and a half octaves. Each bell weighs 
between seven kilograms and six tonnes.  
 
 
Figure 1.a (top) Bell 54 is the small bell (left) shown next to 
bell 4 (right); note the spiral torsion spring pulling the 
clapper away from the inside of bell 54. Figure 1.b 
(bottom) also shows bell 4; note the spring pulling the 
clapper toward bell 4. 
1.3 Haptic Carillon 
The need for carilloneurs to develop musicianship and 
extend the instrument's repertoire offers a compelling 
musical reason to build a haptic practice instrument. 
Unlike other traditional instruments, the carillon, always 
has an audience, willing or unwilling, even if the 
carilloneur is only trying to practice. 
A haptic carillon model needs to represent different 
forces applied on different batons. These forces vary 
considerably depending on the size of the bell and 
therefore the mass of the clapper that has to moved in 
order to play it; they also depend on the length of the 
clapper stem, the size of the return spring (in larger bells) 
and the tension of the guy ropes connecting the baton to 
the bell crank.  
Unlike other traditional instruments the carillon is 
constantly exposed to the elements and its mechanical 
response is also subject to wide variation in temperature. 
The haptic model therefore needs to be adjusted easily to 
simulate differences in the response of each baton across 
the entire range of the same instrument. And because 
corresponding batons on different carillons do not 
necessarily respond uniformly to applied pressure, a haptic 
model must also represent the idiosyncracies of individual 
carillons. 
2. The Carillon Mechanism 
Despite the carillon's imposing mechanical construction its 
kinematic configuration is relatively straightforward. 
Figure 3 is a simplified representation of the mechanism 
for one of batons used to play the instrument. 
In its détente position, each baton rests against one of 
two beams that run horizontally across the range of the 
clavier, the upper beam for 'black' notes the lower for 
'white' notes; in this position, the clapper on each bell is 
held away from the inside rim of the bell as shown in 
Figure 1a and 1b. 
 
 
Figure 2 shows batons laid out in the same chromatic 
keyboard arrangement as a piano with guy ropes connecting 
each baton to a bell crank and clapper located in the bell 
chamber overhead. 
The bell clapper is connected to the baton via the bell 
crank. When a player presses downward on a baton, the 
clapper is pulled toward the inside of the bell. Between the 
upper and lower bells there is considerable variation in the 
force required to displace the clapper from its détente 
position. Measured at the tip of the baton this force is from 
20q30 Newtons for the lower bells to 1q3 Newtons for the 
upper bells. This variation is continuous across the range 
of the clavier but is not linear; bell 4, for instance, requires 
10N to displace the baton where bell 28 – at the halfway 
point in the keyboard – requires less than 3N. 
This variation can mostly be explained in terms of 
different clapper masses for different sized bells and 
difference in the length of the clapper stems and the crank 
masses for each bell.  However, differently configured 
springs in most baton mechanisms can significantly 
mitigate or exaggerate the differences in clapper mass.

Figure 3. This carillon mechanism (in détente position) 
shows the mechanical interactions that constitute the forces 
felt by a player. 
2.1 Return and Forward Springs 
The mechanical configuration shown in Figure 3 shows a 
return spring attached to the clapper. From this diagram it 
is possible to conceptualise that the spring pulls the clapper 
away from the inside of the bell wall, effectively applying 
a restorative force which is felt by the player as resistance 
at the baton tip. 
The return spring is used to ensure that the clapper and 
baton return to the détente position and effectively smooths 
the change in force felt by the player. Each spring applies a 
different restorative force proportional to the force required 
to pull the clapper back to its détente position. Each spring 
also plays its part in producing gradual change in the 
response of batons across the range of the clavier.  
As indicated in Figure 1 the return spring is only used 
on lighter bells. In the National Carillon the heavier bells 
(1q27) use a forward spring to assist the player by pulling 
the clapper against the inside of the bell wall. Without 
forward springs these bells would be unplayable. With the 
forward spring attached a force of 155 Newtons is required 
to hold the clapper against bell 4; with the forward spring 
attached, the force required is between 75 q 90 Newtons, 
depending on the position of the clapper.  
In the National Carillon, bells 35q55 use return springs, 
though almost negligible force is required by bells 35q40 
while bells 28q34 do not use springs. 
3. Dynamic Analysis 
The carillon mechanism can be analysed as three coupled 
rotational systems exchanging forces: the clapper system, 
the crank system and the baton system. A physical model 
is then created that models the motion of each of these 
systems and determines the forces felt at the tip of the 
baton. [2], [3], [4], and [8] are early demonstrations of the 
suitability of this method for the replication of motion and 
forces in mechanical systems. 
3.1 xglyph3308otes on Data Collection 
A difficulty faced in kinematic analysis of the carillon is 
the inaccessibility of a clear majority of the bells.  
Precise geometric measurements are taken of one of the 
heaviest but more accessible bells (bell 4) and masses are 
estimated based on bell’s geometry and the density of the 
material, which for cast iron grey is 7.15 g/cc. Even much 
of this bell is difficult to measure, but solvable using 
trigonometry. We have taken the general kinematic form 
of bell 4 as a model for all other bells, although there are 
several small differences. 
A handqheld spring gauge is used to broadly determine 
static equilibria in different bells measured at different 
parts of each bell. Spring gauge also helped verify mass 
estimates and calculate k values for different springs. 
An inertial measurement unit
1 is also used to measure a 
baton’s dynamic response to different applied forces and 
initial states. The mathematical models shown below are 
verified against both the static forces measured with the 
spring gauge and the baton motions measured in response 
to different forces. 
3.2 Clapper System 
The clapper system consists of three masses: the clapper 
(m
2) and two rods; the first rod (m1) attaches the clapper to 
a pivot inside the bell while the second ( m3) attaches the 
clapper to cables that link it to springs, rubber dampers, 
and the crank system. While the geometric measurements 
of the clapper and clapper position relative to the pivot are 
only approximations for some bells, it is still possible to 
make several generalisations that will apply in the case of 
all bells in the carillon. 
The mechanism for bell 4’s clapper is shown in Figure 
4; all forces external to this mechanism, other than clapper 
impact with the bell, tend to rotate the clapper counterq
clockwise. Lighter bells have a force term pulling the 
clapper clockwise away from the bell. 
The equation of motion for the clapper in free 
movement is given simply as: 
/g1835/g2016/g4663/g3004/g3039/g3028/g3043/g3043/g3032/g3045− /g2028/g3004/g3039/g3028/g3043/g3043/g3032/g3045+ /g1846/g3004/g1838/g3004/g3039/g3028/g3043/g3043/g3032/g3045 = 0,   (1) 
where

Figure 4. Simplified clapper mechanism.  
I is the sum of the moments of inertia of the masses, k is 
the angleqdependent force applied by the spring where the 
sign of k is determined by the direction of spring q forward 
or return and /g1846/g3004/g1838/g3004/g3039/g3028/g3043/g3043/g3032/g3045 is the product of the tension in the 
cable linking the bottom of the clapper rod to the tip of one 
of the crank bars and the distance to the pivot. TC includes 
all the force applied by the tendency of the crank to rotate 
the clapper toward the bell and any force applied by a 
player. The change in angle of the clapper system is very 
small, less than 2 degrees. 
3.2.1 Clapper Impacts 
The clapper system also includes two impact forces that 
are applied when displacement constraints are violated: the 
first of these is impact from the inside of the bell wall, 
forcing the clapper counterqclockwise; the second is 
impact from the rubber stopper that is coupled to the lower 
rod with a cable and stops the clapper from rotating further 
counterqclockwise. It is important to model these impacts 
correctly as they are the principle determinants of the 
motion of the baton tip at its upper and lower extremities. 
3.3 Crank System 
The crank system consists of two rods attached to a pivot 
point; one rod connects to a cable linked to the lower 
clapper rod, and the other to a cable liked to the baton. 
The equation of motion for the crank system is: 
/g1835/g2016/g4663
/g3004/g3045/g3028/g3041/g3038− /g2028/g3004/g3045/g3028/g3041/g3038+ /g1846/g3004/g1870− /g1846/g3003/g1870,   (3) 
where 
/g2028/g3004/g3045/g3028/g3041/g3038=/g1859/g1870/2(cos(/g2016/g3004/g3045/g3028/g3041/g3038+ 90)/g1865/g2869+  
cos (360−/g2016/g3036+ /g2016/g3004/g3045/g3028/g3041/g3038)/g1865/g2870)  (4) 
where θi is the angular offset of the crank connected to the 
clapper. 
I is the sum of inertias of the two crank bars, TC is the 
tension in the cable going to the clapper and TB is the 
tension in the cable going to the baton. The magnitude of 
the crank rotation is approximately 24 degrees. 
 
 
Figure 5. The crank mechanism. The player applies force 
through a link to the baton at the far right of the crank. 
3.4 Baton System 
The baton rotates very slightly – approximately 12 degrees 
– around a pivot point at the nonqplaying end. A rod 
midway along the baton is coupled to a cable which then 
links the baton to the crank, doubling the player’s 
mechanical advantage. A thin tempered steel coupling 
called a flexure (shown in Figure 6) allows the rod to 
remain perpendicular to the détente position of the baton at 
all times even when the baton is pressed downwards. A 
strip of thick felt is also used to reduce friction between the 
wooden retaining structure and the moving rod as it moves 
up and down. Some friction still occurs between the 
moving rod but it is modelled as a function of baton 
position. But it is not baton position but deformation of the 
flexure that pushes the metal rod against the felt strip. 
 
Figure 6. The flexure (highlighted) midway between the baton 
tip and baton pivot.  
The baton is also a relatively simple mechanism; the 
only torque about the pivot is the mass of the baton, the 
mass of the flexure/cable element, the tension in cable /g1846/g3003  
and the force /g1832/g3017 applied by the player at a distance /g1838/g3003/g3028/g3047/g3042/g3041. 
The equation of motion includes these forces and the 
friction due to felt: 
/g1835/g2016/g4663/g3003/g3028/g3047/g3042/g3041+
/g3013/g3251/g3276/g3295/g3290/g3289(/g3021/g3251/g2879 /g3029/g3087/g3251/g3276/g3295/g3290/g3289)
/g2870 − /g2028/g3003/g3028/g3047/g3042/g3041−/g1832/g3017/g1838/g3003/g3028/g3047/g3042/g3041=0 (5) 
where: 
/g2028/g3003/g3028/g3047/g3042/g3041=
/g3034/g3046/g3036/g3041/g3087/g3251/g3276/g3295/g3290/g3289/g3013/g3251/g3276/g3295/g3290/g3289
/g2870 (/g1865/g3003/g3028/g3047/g3042/g3041+/g1865/g3004/g3028/g3029/g3039/g3032)    (6) 
190
and b is a small value that allows for approximately 5N 
at the baton’s maximum displacement (measured with a 
tactile force sensor). 
3.5 Entire System 
The three mechanical subsystems are coupled using stiff 
wound cable. The cable between the clapper and crank is 
always tensed, and during normal usage the cable between 
the baton and the crank is tensed. (The term ‘normal 
usage’ assumes the player applies only downward force on 
the baton. Intuition and observation confirm this usage 
model.) 
For most of the motion of the baton, each subsystem 
exhibits uniform angular acceleration. The only exception 
is when the baton is fully displaced from its détente 
position and the clapper/crank system continues moving 
until the clapper hits the bell – this is similar to a piano 
action where the hammer is in freeqflight toward the string 
after the piano key is fully depressed. This state is 
characterised as a loss of tension in the cable between the 
baton and the crank. 
3.5.1 Clapper/Crank System 
The cable coupling the crank and clapper is always tense, 
therefore the angular acceleration of the crank and clapper 
is always equal. Therefore, we can solve for the 
acceleration of this system around one pivot point by 
proportionately including the forces applied through the 
tension of the cable. This proportion is defined as: 
/g2016/g4663
/g3004/g3039/g3028/g3043/g3043/g3032/g3045= −
/g3013/g3252/g3293/g3276/g3289/g3286
/g3013/g3252/g3287/g3276/g3291/g3291/g3280/g3293
/g2016/g4663/g3004/g3045/g3028/g3041/g3038      (7) 
Solving (1) and (3) for their respective angular 
accelerations, then substituting into (7), and setting the coq
ordinate frame such that θ = 0 when the right crank rod is 
perpendicular to the yqaxis , we get: 
/g3099/g3252/g3287/g3276/g3291/g3291/g3280/g3293/g2879 /g3021/g3252/g3013/g3252/g3287/g3276/g3291/g3291/g3280/g3293
/g3010/g3252/g3287/g3276/g3291/g3291/g3280/g3293
=−(
/g3013/g3252/g3293/g3276/g3289/g3286
/g3013/g3252/g3287/g3276/g3291/g3291/g3280/g3293
)
/g3099/g3252/g3293/g3276/g3289/g3286/g2878/g3013/g3252/g3293/g3276/g3289/g3286(/g3152/g3134/g3127/g3269/g3252)
/g3010/g3252/g3293/g3276/g3289/g3286
 (8) 
Solving (8) for /g1846/g3004 whilst setting /g1846/g3003 to 0 – i.e. no force 
applied by the baton –, then substituting /g1846/g3004 into (3), and 
the resulting expression solved for /g2016/g4663/g3004/g3045/g3028/g3041/g3038 into (7) gives the 
angular acceleration for the clapper, and, therefore, the 
clapper/crank system. 
3.5.2 Baton System Coupling 
The baton system is coupled to the crank with a flexible 
vertical cable. As a result any force in the baton system 
tends to rotate the crank counterqclockwise. This means 
that whenever the sum of torque on the baton pivot is 
negative (↓y, clockwise), all three subsystems exhibit 
uniform angular acceleration defined by: 
/g2016/g4663
/g3004/g3039/g3028/g3043/g3043/g3032/g3045= −
/g3013/g3252/g3293/g3276/g3289/g3286
/g3013/g3252/g3287/g3276/g3291/g3291/g3280/g3293
/g2016/g4663/g3004/g3045/g3028/g3041/g3038= −
 /g3013/g3251/g3276/g3295/g3290/g3289
/g2870/g3415
/g3013/g3252/g3287/g3276/g3291/g3291/g3280/g3293
/g2016/g4663/g3003/g3028/g3047/g3042/g3041  (9) 
By substituting (1) and (5) into (9) and removing the 
crank acceleration term, then removing /g1846/g3004 by solving for 
/g1846/g3003and then following the substitutions in § 3.5.1, the 
uniform angular acceleration of the entire system is found. 
When the sum of torque about the baton is positive, and 
the baton tends counterqclockwise, tension between the 
baton and crank is lost, and the angular acceleration of the 
baton is separate to that of the crank/clapper system. This 
remains the case until torque is once again positive, and 
the natural length l of the cable between the baton and 
crank is reached. 
4. Results 
The results produced in the experimental work show the 
behaviour of the mathematical model under the same 
initial conditions as bells measured at the National 
Carillon. The model is a set of ODEs realised in Simulink 
(Matlab)
2. It takes force at the baton tip as the input, and 
baton angle as the output. The three subsystems are 
modelled separately, but constant tension between all 
couplings is assumed and angular acceleration is calculated 
about the crank pivot. Each system is integrated separately; 
in the case of a loss of tension each subsystem will 
continue to calculate its unique displacement. 
A comprehensive model has been simulated based on 
three bell types: forward spring bell (4), no spring bell 
(28), and return spring bell (41). 
The simulation is initialised with the baton being held, 
then released, from a baton’s maximum displacement. The 
baton moves to the top of its stroke, is repelled by both the 
feltqcovered wooden beam, and the impact of the rubber 
stopper and the clapper rod, and eventually comes to rest 
in its détente position – shown in Figure 3.

Figure 7. Simulated and measured data for bell 4 
 
Bell 4 is one of the few bells in the chamber where 
accurate geometric measurements are possible. From these 
measurements a model for each bell was constructed. This 
model also provides convincing simulations of the 
debounce motion that one observes in the actual carillon.

4.2 Bell 28 – xglyph3308o Spring 
The model for bell 28 is based on the geometry of bell 4, 
with an acrossqtheqboard decrease in system masses, and 
the removal of the forward s pring. The forward spring in 
bell 4 is so powerful that the inevitable error in empirically 
measuring its k leads to slight simulation error. With the 
spring removed as a factor in bell 28 , a significantly lower 
error is recorded in the initial free motion
Figure 8. Simulated and measured data for
4.3 Bell 41 – Return Spring 
Bell 41 is again modelled on the geometry of bell 4, 
drastically reducing the masses in the system and replacing 
the forward spring with a return spring. Simulating the free 
motion of this bell is almost trivially simple, as the force 
applied by the return spring is an order of magnitude 
greater than the sum of all other feedback forces.

5. Conclusion 
The dynamic analysis presented in this paper is the basis 
for the haptic car illon prototype pictured below. The 
mathematical model is arranged such that it can be solved 
in real time using forward dynamics, i.e. the system’s 
motion in response to forces. It is programmed in Simulink 
and compiled to run on a standalone target PC which 
connects to an electromagnetic line ar actuator through a 
dedicated analog I/O board. 
This actuator controls the position of the baton, and 
backqEMF at the actuator windings is measured 
is based on the geometry of bell 4, 
board decrease in system masses, and 
pring. The forward spring in 
bell 4 is so powerful that the inevitable error in empirically 
leads to slight simulation error. With the 
, a significantly lower 
error is recorded in the initial free motion and debounce.

is again modelled on the geometry of bell 4, 
drastically reducing the masses in the system and replacing 
the forward spring with a return spring. Simulating the free 
motion of this bell is almost trivially simple, as the force 
is an order of magnitude 
greater than the sum of all other feedback forces.

The dynamic analysis presented in this paper is the basis 
illon prototype pictured below. The 
hematical model is arranged such that it can be solved 
dynamics, i.e. the system’s 
motion in response to forces. It is programmed in Simulink 
and compiled to run on a standalone target PC which 
ar actuator through a 
controls the position of the baton, and 
EMF at the actuator windings is measured in order to 
close the feedback loop by determining
by the player. 
Work is being undertak
model for any carillon baton, removing the need to 
manually collect data for each, or indeed, most batons.
Future userqtesting will build on current haptic research 
to assess the nature of a performer’s perception of a 
traditional instrument against this haptically rendered one.
