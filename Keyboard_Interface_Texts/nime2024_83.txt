ABSTRACT
This paper presents an affordable and accessible method for
integrated sonic/haptic interaction via a low-cost setup uti-
lizing Lorentz Force Actuation – a form of electromagnetic
actuation – and exemplified by the The Lorentz Lap Brass,
a new electromagnetically-actuated musical instrument and
interface (EMAII). This style of actuation is uncommon
in NIMEs, though it presents rich opportunity for cost-
effective tactile feedback, infinite sustain, and feedback con-
trol. In an effort to encourage open-source knowledge shar-
ing, replication, and adoption of this novel technique, we
describe the underlying concepts, designs, and techniques
for this method and distribute schematics, CAD, and code
used in the setup. Results of a preliminary user study are
discussed and offer perspectives and avenues for improving,
extending, or iterating on the current system.

1. INTRODUCTION
Haptic feedback has been increasingly understood to be vi-
tal to instrument learning and playing[25]. Commercially
available haptic prototyping platforms such as Phantom 1
or Omega2 products are typically expensive and complex,
while more accessible toolchains utilizing affordable com-
ponents such as vibrotactile haptic motors facilitate haptic

interactions that are independent and/or causally separate
from acoustic systems.
The Lorentz Lap Brass was born from a series of experi-
ments in attempt to electromagnetically actuate the strings
of a harpsichord. After successfully sustaining vibrations in
brass strings via optical feedback and Lorentz Force Actua-
tion, we felt there was unexplored potential in electromag-
netically actuating brass strings in a new haptic contexts.
Though the final result of this exploration was a new mu-
sical instrument, the design process was experimental and
exploratory in nature and only two goals were explicitly
stated upon beginning the process of developing the new
interface:
1. Utilize the authors’ established toolchain for Lorentz
Force Actuation of brass strings for simultaneous sound
generation and tactile feedback and
2. Use the displacement from a user’s pressing or pulling
of interface strings as control signals for sonic and hap-
tic feedback
1.1 Related Work
1.1.1 Infinite Sustain/Actuation
There is extensive literature on exciting and sustaining steel
strings, metallic bars, and other idiophones by means of
acoustic and/or electromagnetic feedback [4, 26, 10, 17].
Most electromagnetically actuated instruments/interfaces
(EMAIIs) utilize electromagnetic coils to induce vibrations
into magnetized steel or directly into magnets attached to
an acoustically resonant body [6]. Some instruments uti-
lize dynamic-coil speakers with controlled feedback from
microphones or electromagnetic pickups such as the Hall-
dorophone [31], the Feedback Cello [7], and the Feedback-
Actuated Augmented Bass [19]. Actuated instruments might
also utilize tactile transducers marketed as “bass shakers”
typically used for gaming or home theatre setups. This style
of transducer is essentially a cone-less speaker and will at-
tempt to drive whatever rigid material or surface you mount
it to. The Feedback Lap Steel by Jiffer Harriman [9] and the
Overtone Fiddle by Dan Overholt [24] are such instruments.
Instruments that employ electromagnetic or acoustic feed-
back control are most frequently augmentations of existing
musical instruments. As Schmidt has observed, examples of
instruments developed with electromagnetic actuators from
their genesis are far less common and present a rich oppor-
tunity for exploration [28].
1.1.2 Optical Pickups
Piezoelectric and electromagnetic pickups are probably the
most common forms of transducer for capturing the move-
ment of a vibrating string. Electromagnetic pickups are
widely used in electric guitars, tone wheel organs, and Rhodes
pianos, while piezoelectric pickups embedded within the
bodies of instruments such as acoustic guitars or violins
are used for amplification. Optical pickups emerged as an
alternative technology in the early 2000s. Marketed for hav-
ing the most“transparent”tone possible, this style of pickup
commonly uses infrared LEDs paired with photo transistors.
The ¯ oPIK3 and Lightwave pickup4 are two commercially
available optical pickup systems.
In previous attempts to sustain vibrations in harpsichord
strings, which are traditionally made of brass, we utilized
custom-made optical pickups to act as the sensor for a con-
trolled feedback loop. Though electromagnetic pickups are
perhaps more readily available or typical, brass strings are
non-ferrous and therefore do not induce any signals in elec-
tromagnetic pickups, which rely on the magnetization of a
ferrous string such as stainless steel.
1.1.3 Haptic Feedback
The tactile force feedback experienced by musicians when
playing acoustic and electroacoustic instruments is consid-
ered an important factor in facilitating learning and playa-
bility. There is a growing body of research that addresses
the typical unidirectional communication from performer
to DMI by introducing force feedback through haptic ac-
tuators, and researchers now generally agree that haptic
feedback increases the intimacies between musician and in-
strument and can even make them easier to play [25, 30,
22, 3]. Research by Luciani et al. demonstrated compelling
results from using audio signals to drive the force feedback
of a cello-like haptic simulation [14].
There are a number of NIMEs that have utilized off-the-
shelf controllers such as the NovInt Falcon [12, 21]. Off-the-
shelf haptic solutions can be expensive and require compli-
cated programming, though there have been numerous ef-
forts to make low-cost, accessible, DIY solutions [29, 1, 20]
and create toolchains for implementation [5, 13]. A number
of these devices have been used for navigating digital syn-
thesis models [29, 12, 2, 27]. The system presented below
affords simple, audio-driven haptic feedback from any audio
source.
2. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
In this section, the mechanical, electronic, and software de-
sign involved in the Lorentz Lap Brass is described. This
EMAII was developed in response to the previously stated
exploratory goals. The current design consists of two brass
strings tensioned and tuned with harpsichord tuning pegs.
Optical sensors placed near the bridges of each string sense
the displacement of each string as the player presses or
pulls them. An optical pickup senses the vibrations of one
string while the other string is used to control the excita-
tion signals sent into both strings (Figure 1). Schematics,
CAD, and code for this system is distributed in the following
repository: https://github.com/aschmidt99/LorentzLapBrass.
2.1 Lorentz Force Actuation
The cumulative force felt by a charged particle exposed to
electric and magnetic fields is known as the Lorentz Force.
A special case of the Lorentz Force, sometimes referred to
as the Laplace Force, describes the magnetic force felt by a
3https://www.light4sound.com/
4https://www.willcoxguitars.com/
lightwave-optical-pickup-system/
multitude of moving charges (cumulatively an electric cur-
rent) in a wire exposed to a magnetic field.
2.1.1 Electronics
To generate vibrations in the strings, audio signals are sent
to a 5-Watt audio amplifier module5 based on the PAM8406
IC 6 typically used to power small 4Ω or 8Ω speakers. Rather
than connect to speakers, the output terminals of the am-
plifier are connected to each end of the string, passing an al-
ternating current through the string. The current-carrying
strings generate modest magnetic fields that interact with
strong magnetic fields from permanent neodymium magnets
located directly below the strings. To the authors’ knowl-
edge, this style of actuation has yet to be utilized in any
commercially-available musical instruments, though it was
outlined and directly inspired by Andrew McPherson’s 2012
NIME paper about techniques for electromagnetic actuation
[18], hinted at by inventor Paul Vo’s Moog Guitar patent
[11], and notably used by Alvin Lucier in his performances
of Music On A Long Thin Wire[15].
The PAM8406 chip supports loads down to 2Ω, and fea-
tures short circuit protection preventing the outputs from
activating if a load less than 2Ω is detected. The brass
strings are highly conductive and measure much less than
1Ω, so 10 Watt 2Ω Power Resistors are placed in series with
each string to keep the board out of short circuit protection
mode.
2.1.2 Magnets
The system uses N52 neodymium magnets to create the
necessary magnetic field for actuation. The strength of the
induced vibration is proportional to the cumulative strength
of the magnetic field, and although the presence of just one
or two magnets is sufficient to induce and feel vibrations, a
higher density of magnets placed along the string evokes a
stronger response.
2.2 Audio Hardware
The vibration of the sound-generating string is picked up
with a custom optical pickup made using a ITR9608 photo-
electric switch. Dave Corsie’s optical pickup blog 7 outlined
a schematic for creating optical pickups for upright bass.
Modifications were made to Corsie’s circuit, although the
working principle is the same: the vibrating string varies the
base current of a phototransistor by occluding an infrared
LED directed at the detector. This, in turn, modulates
the current flow from the collector to emitter. The voltage
across a fixed resistor in series with the emitter then varies
proportionally. When placed in an optimal position, this
voltage is directly analogous to the position of the string
and can be treated as an audio signal. It is amplified and
buffered by a preamp circuit which is then connected to an
audio interface with a standard 1/4” guitar cable.
2.3 String Displacement Sensing
ITR20403 Optical sensors similar to the above ITR9608 op-
tical sensor are mounted in the bridges of each string. Each
string has two custom 3D-printer bridge mechanisms that
allow for precise placement of the string within the sensor’s
field of operation. An adjustment screw can fine-tune the
height and length of the string, while a V-wheel adjusts the

position the string within the optical sensor gap (Figure 2).
Once again, a voltage divider is created between the sensor’s
photo sensitive resistor and a predetermined resistor value.
A Teensy 4.0 reads the outputs of each of the four voltage
divider circuits. The values are measured and reported to
Max/MSP every 10 milliseconds via a serial port.
2.4 Digital Signal Processing
The audio interface is connected to a laptop utilizing Max/MSP
for audio analysis and generation, which will be described
in detail with each of the interaction modes.
3. PERFORMANCE INTERFACE
The Lorentz Lap Brass has two brass strings stretched across
custom 3D printed roller bridges. Each string can be pressed
or pulled with the player’s hands or played with a brass or
glass guitar slide. One string is the designated “sound gen-
erating” string, which has an optical pickup located at the
left end of the string. The string further from the player is
the “expression” or “control” string, which also incorporated
haptic feedback. The form of the instrument is reminiscent
of a lap steel guitar and can be played similarly (Figure 3).
3.1 Interaction Modes
O’Modhrain’s research in utilizing haptic feedback for a
theremin-style musical interaction inspired haptic approaches
to the design of the instrument’s interaction [22]. We de-
vised 4 modes of interaction that were explored in the user
study described below. In most modes, the interaction
evokes that of a theremin, with one hand controlling the ter-
mination point (and thus pitch) of the “sound-generating”
string while the other hand contributes to the amplitude
and timing of the signal injected into the string, which
more or less acts as a volume control. In most performance
modes, the expression string controls the amplitude of the
input signal or the amount of feedback injected into the
strings.
3.1.1 Percussive actuation mode
In this mode, when the user presses or pulls the expression
string (the further string) beyond a threshold, an 808-style
percussive signal is sent into both strings. The user may fret
the sound-generating string (the closer string) with their
hand or a guitar slide to achieve a note with a percussive
attack.
3.1.2 Noisy actuation mode
In this mode, the expression string simply controls the am-
plitude of pink noise being injected into the string, exciting
the string at its open or fretted frequency.
3.1.3 Sustain mode
The Sigmund external library 8 for Max/MSP is utilized
to track the pitch of the incoming signal from the sound
generating string. The estimated pitch value controls an
oscillator signal that is sent back into the string, achieving
an infinite sustain. The amount of feedback is controlled by
depth of press on the expression string.
3.1.4 Harmonic Scanning mode
An extension of the Oscillator sustain mode, harmonic scan-
ning mode adds a level of control over of the harmonics
present in the system. The fundamental frequency con-
tinues to be sustained via an injected pitch-matched sine
wave oscillator, but now several harmonics are calculated
and injected. The gain of each harmonic is controlled by
the displacement of the left side of the expression string,
while the overall gain of the feedback remains controlled by
the right side.

4. USER STUDY
4.1 Methodology
The Lorentz Lap Brass is part of a larger project exam-
ining ways that instrument design practice can reside in
communities embodying diverse cultural values. Informed
by Marquez-Borbon’s work on collaborative learning and
communities of practice [16], as well as a wealth of research
stemming from the concept of design probes [8], we there-
fore sought to engage peers in the design process, using the
initial iteration of the instrument as a basis. Rather than
evaluation in the traditional sense [23], the goals are: 1) to
gain experiential impressions of the interaction modes, with
particular focus on the haptic/sonic integration; and 2) to
engage peers in open-ended ideation on future developments
of the instrument or applications of these techniques.
4.1.1 Participants
The 5 participants all self-identified as musicians, ranging
from 12 to 20 years of experience with playing one or more
musical instruments. All participants had at least 5 years
of experience working with music technology. All partici-
pants considered themselves familiar with Digital Musical
Instruments or Alternative Musical Interfaces, and 3 of 5
participants expressed familiarity with the New Interfaces
for Musical Expression (NIME) Community.
4.1.2 Protocol
Participants were presented four modes of interaction or-
der of increasing complexity: percussive audio playback
mode, noisy sustain mode, regular sustain mode, and har-
monic scanning mode. Participants were encouraged to
think aloud throughout the process, vocalizing what they
liked and disliked, found interesting or off-putting, or any
other stream-of-consciousness thoughts. Limited instruc-
tions were offered upon initiation of each mode to encour-
age exploration of the system, though the facilitator demon-
strated or described additional possible interaction methods
upon request or if users appeared stuck or confused. After
experiencing the four modes, participants were asked follow-
up questions to encourage deeper discussion.
4.2 Feedback and Discussion
Participants were asked to rank the modes from most to
least favorite and provide rationale for their ranking. Though
several users were initially delighted by the feeling of percus-
sive 808-style signals, most participants ranked this among
their least favorite modes. Multiple participants noted that
a hammer-on with their a finger was more effective at ex-
citing the string than the percussive actuation signal. The
noisy actuation mode was also commonly ranked lower, with
most users noting how the noisy cross-talk between the ac-
tuation signal and the speaker was distracting. The regular
sustainer mode consistently ranked more favorable amongst
users and was frequently compared to eBows for its slow at-
tack and timbre. Harmonic scanning mode was most divi-
sive, ranking high for some users and low for others. Some
participants found the unpredictability and instability of
the re-synthesis algorithm in this mode sonically interest-
ing while others noted frustration with the lack of precise
control.
Common themes emerged when probing participants’ rank-
ings and answers to follow-up questions. Multiple users
noted how two identical strings possessing completely dif-
ferent functions was not intuitive and subverted expecta-
tions. This was most noticeable in the percussive actua-
tion mode, where pressing one string to create sound in
the other was considered strange. Some participants sug-
gested that the discrete action of triggering a sound was
probably a better fit for discrete interactions such as but-
ton presses and that their prior experience with stringed
instruments prompted them to anticipate plucking and fret-
ting interactions instead. The theme of prior musical prac-
tice shaping expectations persisted throughout the study,
and we speculate established practises similarly informed
the responses to our open-ended prompts to imagine differ-
ent ways to remix the underlying technology in new ideas
for instruments and/or interfaces. 4 out of the 5 partici-
pants are proficient stringed-instrument players, so it was
not surprising that many noted the desire to have multiple
sound-generating strings to play harmonies and chords. One
participant’s background in modular synthesizers likely in-
fluenced their idea to add a patch bay to excite and control
dozens of strings with any audio signals a user wishes rather
than ones predetermined by a designer. Most participants
also expressed interest in scaling different aspects of the sys-
tem, imagining larger or smaller string lengths/thicknesses
or reorientation/relocation of the strings.
Many remarks were made about the multi-modal sensory
experience, not only commenting on the audible and tactile
aspects of the system, but also the visual feedback from the
Max patch and the string itself. Users enjoyed seeing the
string’s vibration, nodes, and anti-nodes, suggesting this
quality was perhaps as important to them as the tactile
feedback itself.
4.3 Limitations
The system presented to participants contained finicky tech-
nology elements that compromised some aspects of func-
tionality during user studies, but the authors were ulti-
mately interested in using this setup to facilitate discus-
sion and direction for future creative applications of this
technology rather than assessing the Lorentz Lap Brass it-
self. Though technical issues might traditionally need total
mitigation before attempting a user study, the decision to
seek user feedback tried to circumnavigate apparent engi-
neering issues in pursuit of assessing new creative poten-
tials. Despite the technical challenges, what came out of
the study has proven stimulating and facilitated discussion
about how DMI designers can glean insights from present-
ing in-progress technology before it is very refined. This
shift from a more typical design paradigm allows artistic
and creative feedback to drive and influence future engi-
neering decisions that might otherwise be approached on
exclusively technical terms.
5. FUTURE WORK
5.1 Electronic Crosstalk
The current system has noticeable electronic cross-talk be-
tween the optical pickup circuit and the signal present on
the brass strings that must be addressed. Follow-up versions
of this system should take additional care to in electromag-
netic shielding.
5.2 Optical Sensing Improvements
The current sensors’ range and placement only allowed for
a general displacement signal – the system does not know
whether the strings are pushed down or pulled up. Look-
ing into more thoughtful sensor placement or sensors with
a larger range could allow for disambiguation between more
gestures, and additional signals could be used for more com-
plex and nuanced control over the system.
5.3 Participant-described instruments
The user study was useful in establishing longer-term col-
laborations centered around composers co-defining and cre-
ating new interfaces with music technologists. Several of
new instruments/interfaces that were described by partici-
pants will be pursued as an outcome of this project.
6. CONCLUSION
The final result of this exploratory research was a new method
for frugal integrated haptic/sonic interaction exemplified by
the Lorentz Lap Brass. The design process and user study
identified new potentials and directions for utilizing Lorentz
force actuation in musical interactions. Although the form
was reminiscent of familiar instruments such as lap steel
guitars, the use of additional sensing proved a worthy en-
deavor and revealed new methods for inventing new, haptic-
feedback driven electromagnetically actuated instruments -
an emerging area of inquiry the authors finds to be under-
explored yet ripe with potential.
7. ETHICAL STANDARDS
This research was conducted in accordance with the NIME
Principles & Code of Practice on Ethical Research, and in
compliance with the standards and practices of the Uni-
versity of Michigan. All participants were volunteers and
granted informed consent. The author states no conflict of
interest.
