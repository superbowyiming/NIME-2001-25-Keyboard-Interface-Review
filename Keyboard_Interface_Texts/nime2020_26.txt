ABSTRACT
Musical expressivity is an important aspect of musical per-
formance for humans as well as robotic musicians. We
present a novel mechatronics-driven implementation of Bru-
shless Direct Current (BLDC) motors in a robotic marimba
player, named Shimon, designed to improve speed, dynamic
range (loudness), and ultimately perceived musical expres-
sivity in comparison to state-of-the-art robotic percussionist
actuators. In an objective test of dynamic range, we ﬁnd
that our implementation provides wider and more consistent
dynamic range response in comparison with solenoid-based
robotic percussionists. Our implementation also outper-
forms both solenoid and human marimba players in striking
speed. In a subjective listening test measuring musical ex-
pressivity, our system performs signiﬁcantly better than a
solenoid-based system and is statistically indistinguishable
from human performers.

1. INTRODUCTION
The ability to perform music expressively is often considered
outside the capability of robot and computer music systems
[11]. Multiple studies show expressivity can be achieved
through subtle manipulation of volume and micro timings
[3, 8, 21]. This paper proposes a new implementation of
Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motors in a robotic musi-
cian platform named Shimon, focusing on capturing human
musical expressivity through accurate micro-timing control
and high-resolution consistent dynamic range. Unlike previ-
ous actuators used in robotic percussionists such as solenoids
and linear motors, our implementation promises to pro-
vide accurate and expressive performance that is indistin-
guishable from expressive human performance. The system
was evaluated in comparison with four marimba players us-
ing extensive listening tests to identify its ability to equal
human-level musical expressivity.

2. RELA TED WORK
Our work is situated in an interdisciplinary space that in-
cludes research in Robotic Musicianship (RM) and human
performance expressivity. Research in RM addresses the
construction of machines that can produce sound, analyze
and generate musical input, and interact with humans in
a musically meaningful manner [6]. There are two primary
research areas that constitute the ﬁeld of RM: 1). Machine
Musicianship - the development of algorithms and cogni-
tive models of music perception, composition, performance,
and theory [23] and 2). Musical Mechatronics - the study
and construction of physical devices that generate sound
through mechanical means [16]. While recent works in RM
have led to signiﬁcant advancements in Machine Musician-
ship including aspects such as machine improvisation [7],
group synchronization and anticipation [14, 9], and turn
taking [29], little progress has been made to improve the
acoustic expressivity of robotic musicians through advance-
ments in Musical Mechatronics. A number of notable Mu-
sical Mechatronics eﬀorts have addressed wind instruments
[10, 27], and string instruments [26, 19]. Several robotic
systems have been designed to capture human expressiv-
ity, focusing on wrist and arm movements. TheCog robot
from MIT, for example, uses oscillators for smoother rhyth-
mic arm control [31, 30]. Another approach to smooth mo-
tion control is to use hydraulics as done by Mitsuo Kawato
in his humanoid drummer [2]. However, most of the ef-
forts to develop robotic percussionists have used solenoid
actuation [20, 17, 26], which cannot support human-level
dynamic range and millisecond micro-timing - key required
elements for musical expressivity. Baraldi et. al have shown
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020

that both musicians and non-musicians identify expressiv-
ity with only a few low level parameters. From a perfor-
mance perspective these are micro-timing and volume con-
trol, while others are largely dictated by the composition
itself [3]. Canazza et. al [8] and Mion [21] demonstrated
the importance of notes timing and variations in amplitude
for perceived expression.
In our own previous work, we attempted to advance mech-
atronics-driven expressivity for robotic percussionists by us-
ing actuators such as a linear motor that drove one of the
arms of the robotic percussionist Haile [28] and a gimbal
motor that was used for the Robotic Drumming Prosthetic
(RDP) [5]. Haile’s linear motor provided wider and more
consistent dynamic range than possible with solenoids [18].
However, this came at the expense of striking speed, which
was limited to 6 Hz and could not support more subtle
striker micro-timings. The gimbal motor used for the RDP,
on the other hand, was able to reach much higher speed (20
Hz) and control a variety of bouncing proﬁles using PID
control [12]. However, due to its design, the RDP could
not control wide and consistent dynamic range and there-
fore could not support rich musical expressivity. In an ef-
fort to signiﬁcantly improve both dynamic range and micro-
timing control for robotic percussionists, we redesigned our
solenoid-based marimba-playing robotic musician Shimon
[13]. For the work described in this paper, we replaced
Shimon’s solenoids with BLDC motors [22], which hitherto
have not been used for RM, in an eﬀort to achieve human
level musical expressivity through wide dynamic range and
high resolution and consistent micro-timing control.

3. MOTIV A TION AND APPROACH
Informed by the related work described above, our moti-
vation for this project was to identify, implement, and test
a mechanical actuator that would allow for wide and con-
sistent dynamic range control and high playing speeds that
could facilitate human-level performance expressivity. In
addition to conducting objective evaluation of our imple-
mentation in comparison to state-of-the-art robotic percus-
sionist actuators, we also performed subjective evaluation,
comparing the musical outcome of our implementation to
human performance. To address this motivation, we identi-
ﬁed and implemented BLDC motors in our robotic marimba
musician named Shimon[13]. We hypothesize that the mo-
tor’s fast response rate, PID-control feedback loop, fast
Figure 3: Shimon’s new striker consists of a mallet
and a motor shaft. The mallet is modeled as a ball
with radiusR and a rod with length L
oscillation and precise motion control could enable larger
dynamic range and playing speeds than can be achieved
by state-of-the-art solutions. Moreover, BLDC motors are
known for their high torque-to-weight ratio, low noise levels,
and long lifespan [32], which makes them a suitable choice
for our system.
4. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A TION
4.1 Platform
The ﬁrst design requirement we addressed was to replace
Shimon’s old solenoid-driven strikers with BLDC motors
while maintaining the original design of the robot’s arms.
To ﬁt into Shimon’s arms, the actuator had to be less than
65 millimeters in diameter, and 40 millimeters in depth.
At nominal output, the solenoid provides suﬃcient loud-
ness. We therefore aimed to select a motor that matched
the solenoid’s maximum applied torque on the marimba,
measured to be 0.3125 Nm.
In order to assess whether the motor speciﬁcation ﬁt these
requirements, we analyzed a simple 1 degree of freedom
model shown in Figure 3. The mallet was modeled as a
combination of a ball and a rod. The ball had radiusR and
mass mb, and the rod had length L and mass ms. The mal-
let rotates with the pivot point at the center of the motor
with angleθ. For downstroke, the net torque on the striker
Md with motor torque output Mm is,
Md = Mm + Mg − Mf (1)
where Mf can be found by torque constant km and no-
load current Io, both provided by the motor manufacturer.
The required output torque by the motor is
Mm = Md − [mb(R + L) + ms
L
2 ]sin(θ)g − kmIo (2)
where the largest torque happens right at the instance of
hit.
We used these calculations to evaluate whether a motor
can achieve the desired downstroke torque Md of 0.3125 Nm.
Our resulting choice is Maxon’s EC-60 ﬂat motor, which can
be seen in Figure 1. According to the motor’s speciﬁcations
and Equation 2, it requires an output torqueMm of 0.316
Nm to meet the downstroke torque requirement. The EC-
60 exceeds this requirement with a nominal torque of 0.319
Nm. It additionally meets our size requirements, with a
65-millimeter diameter and 38-millimeter depth.
The new system maintained the previous arm design,
although the particular motor we chose did require inte-
rior redesign of the arms. As shown in Figure 2, each of
the aluminum arms is comprised of two mallets, which are
clamped directly onto the shafts of two Maxon EC-60 ﬂat
motors. The arms’ inner walls are attached with sound
deadening mat from Noico to damp any noise between the

motor and the arm case. Similarly to the old system, the
lower striker in each arm was placed to play the white keys
of the marimba and the top four strikers were placed in a
position to play the row of black keys. The commercial IAI
linear actuator, which controls longitude direction of the
arms, remained unchanged in the new system.
4.2 Motor Implementation
The eight Maxon E-60 motors are controlled by Maxon
EPOS4 50/8 PID controllers and communicate through Eth-
ernet with Control Automation Technology (EtherCAT) pro-
tocol. The motor control is executed through Beckhoﬀ’s
TwinCat3 programmable logic controller (PLC) system, op-
erated under Beckhoﬀ’s C6015 Industrial PC (IPC). The
ﬁrst controller in the daisy chain connects to the Beckhoﬀ
IPC that works as an EtherCAT master, as shown in ﬁgure
5.
PID values are determined when mallets are clamped to
the motor shaft, using an auto tuning function provided
by Maxon EPOS studio, a commercially available software
to assist the initialization of Maxon motors. Cyclic Syn-
chronous Position Mode (CSP) is used as primary operation
mode through Beckhoﬀ TwinCat3 PLC system to achieve
tick synchronization in real-time. Both acceleration and po-
sition need to be speciﬁed in the proﬁle of motion command.
All eight motors can then be triggered simultaneously by
ticks when Shimon plays multiple note chords. Since BLDC
motors do not hold their positions when the system is not
powered, we programmed the PLC system to home motor
encoders during initialization to a default position above
the marimba (see details in Figure 4).
We have chosen MIDI to communicate between the PLC
and the motor controller, since MIDI is a well established
protocol for musical instrument communication that is com-
monly used by musicians to compose for and interact with
Shimon. The angular acceleration deﬁned in the motion
command is linearly mapped with MIDI velocity to provide
smooth increase in striking volume. The MIDI standard
does not specify how to interpret velocity, instead allow-
ing manufactures to map in whatever way is suited to an
instruments design [1]. In order to follow musical tempo
and to control micro-timing while playing expressively, the
travel time for each mallet stroke must remain constant.
We therefore linearly interpolated the position values with
the accelerations. The value of MIDI velocity can therefore
fully deﬁne a motion proﬁle. A threshold for MIDI veloc-
ity was identiﬁed through experimentation to sense whether
the mallets hit the marimba surface. Once the threshold is
reached, the PLC system sends out another motion com-
mand to lift the mallets back up to the default position and
wait for the next note. A velocity monitoring command
block is built into the PLC system to compensate for real
Figure 5: System Communication and Data ﬂow
time errors and to maintain stable acoustic sound quality.
4.3 Communication and Data Flow
The MIDI instructions are transformed into lower level ac-
tuator commands, as the note information is sent synchrono-
usly to both the linear actuator and the strikers via UDP.
UDP messages that are sent from Max/MSP are received
by a Nvidia Jetson TX2 and the IPC, as shown in ﬁgure 5.
The Nvidia Jetson TX2 was used to allow for future deep
learning capabilities, as used in other robotic music plat-
forms [24, 25]. A motion control library written in C++
executes the motion commands that control the linear ac-
tuators. The note’s pitch information is linearly translated
to sliding movements of the actuators to map the pitches
to the respective physical marimba key positions. These
key positions are customized to the marimba used and are
manually deﬁned. Trajectories are then handled by IAI’s
SCON controller. MIDI velocity information is converted
to BLDC motor acceleration and position. They are exe-
cuted by PLC’s motion control command, while the EPOS4
motor controllers calculate the trajectories based on the ex-
ecuted command. This allows for MIDI commands to be
speciﬁed using musical software such as Logic Pro X and
MAX/MSP on a Macbook. Therefore, musicians working
with Shimon do not need to communicate with its low-level
control, and focus only on their musical programming.
5. EXPERIMENTS
Three experiments were designed to evaluate the speed, dy-
namic range, and perceived expression of our BLDC-driven
robotic percussionist implementation. Since it has been
shown that expressivity can be communicated using just
one note [3], the experiments were designed to use a single
motor on a single note. This approach also allowed us to
better control for variables and to streamline the experiment
protocol.
5.1 Research Question and Hypotheses
Our goals for the system were to exceed the speed and
micro-timing resolution of state-of-art robotic or human
percussionists, to support a consistent and wide dynamic
range control, and to play expressively in a manner that
would be indistinguishable from a human performer. To
test whether these goals were achieved, we designed exper-
iments to compare the solenoid, BLDC motor, and human
marimba players based on the following hypotheses:
1. Dynamic Range and Speed Capabilities
(a) The BLDC motor will be able to perform with
a wider and more stable dynamic range than a
solenoid when striking on a marimba.
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020
135
(b) The BLDC motor will outperform both solenoid
striker and human players in striking speed on a
marimba.
(c) The BLDC motor striker will be able to repro-
duce the volume and speed range played by a
human or solenoid with equal or greater consis-
tency
2. Capturing Human expressivity
(a) In a listening test, subjects will not be able to
recognize if a musical excerpt is played by the
our system or a skilled performer
6. METHODOLOGY
To evaluate these hypotheses we conducted both objective
and subjective experiments.
6.1 Objective Experiment Design
For each objective measure we recorded solenoids, BLDC
motors and a human player completing identical tasks.
6.1.1 Dynamic Range
Both solenoids and BLDC motors were programmed to play
single C2 note at 60 bpm on the marimba, with ascending
MIDI velocity of step 1 from 1 to 127 for every 6 strokes.
The MIDI notes are triggered by Apple Logic X Digital Au-
dio Workstation. Each of the marimba players were asked
to play single C2 note at 60 bpm on the marimba for 3
diﬀerent trials.
• Play loudest possible for 6 strokes.
• Play softest possible for 6 strokes.
• Play ascending ﬁve dynamic levels from softest to loud-
est, with 6 strokes per level.
An SPL meter records the sound level change throughout
all the strokes.
6.1.2 Speed
Both solenoids and BLDC motors were programmed to play
single C2 note for 3 seconds with system deﬁned speed. Set
speed was gradually increased for each trial until either fail
of hit or power cutoﬀ. Each of the marimba players were
asked to play the note C2 as fast as possible for 3 seconds
with three diﬀerent dynamic requirements. The ﬁrst trial
had no constraint in volume; the second trial required the
player to play as soft and as fast as possible; the third trial
asked the player to play as loud and as fast as possible.
6.2 Subjective Experiment Design
We recorded four marimba players performing twelve, four
measure long expressive excerpts on a single note, collected
from Belson’s Modern Reading Text [4]. The players were
allowed to practice each phrase as long as desired. Each
phrase was then recreated for the solenoid and BLDC mo-
tors using Abelton Live’s audio to midi, followed by human
veriﬁcation.
Musical expressivity was then evaluated using a 30-minute
listening test administrated through Qualtrics. We col-
lected results from 21 participants, 14 of which listened
in a controlled environment through headphones, while the
other 7 listened externally through headphones of their choice.
Participants were gathered with high-school level music train-
ing or above.
The process began with a page introduction to musical ex-
pressivity, through a collection of quotes, following method-
ologies from [11]. This was followed by 36 iterations of the
question Which sample is more musically expressive?. We
compared solenoid, BLDC and human excerpts in pair-wise
conﬁgurations so as to have direct comparison between each
performance type. Excerpts and questions were randomly
ordered. The questionnaire ended with three open-ended
questions allowing participants to comment on any trends
they noted, any diﬃculties comparing excerpts and a de-
scription of their musical education.
6.3 Apparatus
6.3.1 Recording Speciﬁcation
Audio was recorded with three SM-57 microphones, posi-
tioned at the center point beneath each key, 40 centimeters
above the ground. The microphones were sent through a
Focusrite Scarlett 18i20, with a set calibrated pre-amp vol-
ume.
6.3.2 Dynamic Range Measurement
Dynamic ranges were determined through R8080 type 2
sound pressure level (SPL) meter by REED instruments.
The SPL meter was calibrated at 94 dB with REED R8090
sound level calibrator and placed 30 centimeters away, point-
ing towards the sound source. Frequency weighting was
set to dBC to capture peak acoustic sound levels and time
weighting indicator was set to SLOW to record averaged
Decibel rate. Data was recorded on a Windows 10 com-
puter running REED Datalogger Software with sampling
rate of 500ms per data sample.
6.3.3 Speed Measurement
Mallet movement was recorded through a slow motion video
recording with 240 frames per second by an iPhone X. Tracker
video analysis and modeling tool was used for motion track-
ing. Speed was acquired by obtaining the number of peri-
odic movements over ﬁxed time span.
7. RESUL TS
7.1 Objective Experiment Results
Figure 6 presents a comparison between the dynamic range
achieved by Shimon’s previous solenoid system and our new
BLDC motor implementation in response to MIDI veloc-
ity from 1 to 127. Room noise was measured as 55 dB.
As MIDI velocity increased, logarithmic curves in loudness
were observed for both actuators. However, the dynamic
range achieved by the solenoid was 73 dB to 83 dB, com-
pared to the larger 57 dB to 83 dB range for the BLDC
motor. The solenoid also demonstrated larger ﬂuctuation
in sound level in comparison to the BLDC motor. Sound
intensity was calculated based on sound pressure level and a
reference intensity of 20 micropascals. The result exhibited
a linear correlation between sound intensity and MIDI ve-
locity for the BLDC motor through the full dynamic range.
The solenoid followed linear correlation at lower dynamic
range as well, but failed after MIDI velocity reached 80. The
ﬁgure additionally shows lower stability in the solenoid’s
sound intensity control, as indicated by less consistent val-
ues. The linear interpolation achieved a norm of residual of
6.899e-05, and showed an increase of 1.4472e-06W/m 2 in
sound intensity for each step increase in MIDI velocity.
7.1.1 Speed
The solenoid reached up to 8.3 Hz in striking speed using
the old striker system, before the actuator failed to hit the
marimba surface. Our BLDC motor reached a speed of
32.9 Hz, before the over-current protection cut oﬀ the mo-
tor controller for safety purposes. In comparison, the aver-
age fastest speed recorded from 4 diﬀerent human marimba

range of 1 to 127
players was 7.1 Hz. No signiﬁcant maximum speed levels
in diﬀerent dynamic ranges were observed among human
players.
7.2 Subjective Experiment Results
We conducted a binomial test to compare each grouping of
motors and humans (see ﬁgure 7) with maximum rating of
252 positive results. The solenoid performed much worse
than the human, with ratings of 180 positive to the human,
over 72 to the solenoid. This resulted inp = 1 . 3e− 0.9. The
BLDC motor also performed better than the solenoid, how-
ever the value was much closer atp = 0 . 0029. Comparing
the human and BLDC motor results, the human excerpts
received 137 choices as more expressive over the BLDC mo-
tor’s 115. However this result was not signiﬁcantp = 0 . 19,
failing to reject the null hypothesis.
Figure 7: Participant Expressivity Ratings
8. DISCUSSION
Our experiments demonstrated that the BLDC motor pro-
vided wider dynamic range than the solenoid. Since the
overall size and power are similar between the solenoid and
the BLDC motor, it is expected to observe similar maximum
sound level for both actuators. The advantage of BLDC mo-
tor in respect to dynamic range was more noticeable on the
lower range and stability. The BLDC motor provided a full
dynamic range consistently and with high resolution from
room noise to the system threshold. The solenoid on the
other hand had lowest sound level of 74 dB. We associated
this performance with the motor’s higher response rate and
feedback control over both position and acceleration. The
captured audio from the solenoids oscillated throughout the
whole dynamic range, which could be explained by its lack
of feedback control that leads to unstable output torque. On
the other hand, our BLDC motor implementation using PID
controllers ensured much more stable output torque and
position, which led to smooth dynamic range with higher
resolution. Both BLDC motor and solenoid outperformed
human players in striking speed. However, Shimon’s 8.3 Hz
solenoids played relatively slower than other solenoid sys-
tems utilized in related work such as Kapur Fingers (14.28
Hz) and Trimpin Hammer (18.18 Hz), although these faster
solenoid systems also reported lack of volume controls [18].
At maximum play speed of 32.9 Hz, the new BLDC motor
system supports distinctive micro timing that we associate
with enhanced music expressivity.
In our subjective test, most of the 21 participants could
not diﬀerentiate the excerpts played by humans and Shi-
mon with BLDC motor, but the excerpts played by hu-
mans and solenoid were distinguishable. We explain this by
the BLDC’s mimetic control in volume and micro timing,
which led Shimon to imitate excerpts from human play-
ers indistinguishably. Even though the human excerpts re-
ceived higher votes in expressivity than those played with
the BLDC motor, the result was not signiﬁcant. Between
excerpts of BLDC motor and solenoid, most of the partic-
ipants voted for the BLDC motor in musical expressivity.
Compared with the solenoid system, the new BLDC motor
system was able to musically replicate human expressivity in
performance with high resolution control in dynamic range,
speed and timing.
9. FUTURE WORK
In future work, we plan to further evaluate our implemen-
tation of BLDC motors in a more comprehensive musical
context, including reproducing full melodic phrases rather
than just one-note rhythmic excerpts. Building on our pre-
liminary work on anticipatory visual cues in robotic musi-
cianship, [15], we also plan to take advantage of the accurate
position control of the BLDC motor to implement and eval-
uate novel anticipatory visual cues for human-robot musical
interaction. We anticipate that the integration of detailed
motion design with both BLDC motors and Shimon’s linear
actuator would lead to improved synchronization and coor-
dination between robotic musicians and humans, leading to
even more expressive and engaging musical performances.
