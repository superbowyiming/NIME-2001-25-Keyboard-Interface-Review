ABSTRACT
This paper explores the concept of co-creativity in a perfor-
mance for feedback-augmented bass clarinet. The bass clar-
inet is augmented using a loudspeaker placed on the bell and
a supercardiod microphone placed inside the instrument’s
body, allowing for the generation of feedback that is sub-
sequently processed by a computational system to create
new sound material. This feedback loop creates a symbi-
otic relationship between the performer and the electron-
ics, resulting in the co-creation of the final piece, with the
performer and the electronics influencing each other. The
result is a unique and ever-evolving musical experience that
poses interesting challenges to the traditional instrument–
electronics and composer–opera relationship. This paper
reports on both the hardware and software augmentation
of the bass clarinet, and presents “WYPYM - Were you a
part of your mother?”, a piece written especially for this
augmented instrument and its feedback system.

1. INTRODUCTION
This paper describes a long–term collaboration between the
two authors, respectively a composer and a clarinetist. The
collaboration started in 2020 as part of the project “Differ-
ent Tubes”1, aimed at investigating clarinet preparation, in
its widest sense, through collaborative practice. The project
evolved into realizing a DIY (Do It Yourself) augmented
bass clarinet based on feedback, and exploring its poten-
tialities through a music performance. This paper summa-
rizes the technical implementation of the augmented bass

clarinet, and presents “WYPYM - Were you a part of your
mother?”, a piece written for this augmented instrument
and its feedback system.
2. BACKGROUND
An augmented instrument is the result of adding new sen-
sors to an existing instrument, thus allowing the performer
to control digital audio effects through their gestures. [1]
Some notable examples include the augmented trumpet [9],
trombone [4, 11], violin [2], and piano [3, 14].
One sub-category of augmented instruments uses audio
feedback to enrich the acoustic instrument’s timbre. These
instruments generally employ an actuator and a micro-
phone 2, which are coupled through the resonant body of the
instrument and connected in a feedback loop that includes
analogue and/or digital signal processing [7] (see e.g. [22,
18, 6, 15, 21, 13]). Examples of feedback-augmented wood-
wind instruments include the WindBack [12], a feedback-
augmented alto saxophone, and the ResoFlute [12], an elec-
tronically augmented traditional Western concert flute. In-
terestingly, little attention has been devoted to augment-
ing the (bass) clarinet via feedback. Only one attempt has
been documented in the academic literature3, the feedback-
augmented alto clarinet by Stelios Manousakis 4. As of yet,
there are no examples of feedback-augmented bass clarinets
in the literature.
2.1 Co-creation and collaborative practice
The primary objective of this collaboration was to explore
the preparation of the bass clarinet. We initially focused
on the potential use of feedback as a means of enhanc-
ing the instrument’s timbre and capabilities. Furthermore,
both of the authors were keen to investigate how they could
break down the traditional hierarchy of roles, specifically
the relationship between the composer and performer, the
composer and the piece, and the performer and the instru-
ment. In the development phase of the feedback-augmented
bass clarinet, we approached the system from an ecological
perspective [5], in which the performer and the instrument
are coupled via feedback processes. Eventually we framed
the research collaboration through the lens of co–creativity.
Co–creativity refers to the possibility that artists and com-
puters can collaborate integrating their specializations and
ultimately co–acting in the creation of the final musical work
2Or any means that can transduce acoustic vibrations to an
electrical signal.

mented by – academia is the work by Edith
Steyer, https://edithsteyer.bandcamp.com/album/

[8]. In this sense, our feedback system and the composer ex-
tend each other’s creativity. The feedback-augmented bass
clarinet becomes a sort of living organism performing with
the instrumentalist. In this extended collaborative process
artists and machines do what they can do best, at their
own pace. This collaboration can lead to unexplored music
outcome that might not be possible with traditional music
composition techniques alone.

3. BASS CLARINET AUGMENTATION
The hardware and software components of the implementa-
tions are described in detail below. The design was guided
by the fact that we wanted the augmentation to be as sim-
ple as possible, require cost–effective materials, and adopt
open–source software, thereby allowing for replication and
elaboration by others.
3.1 Hardware
The augmented bass clarinet consists of a miniature mi-
crophone placed inside the body of the instrument and a
speaker cone placed on its bell (see Figure 1). Since the
aim was to produce feedback inside the instrument, the
hardware placement was crucial, resulting in many refining
prototyping stages.
We used a common 5 ′′ woofer (40 W power, 8Ω
impedance) placed on the bell of the instrument. To keep
the speaker in place, a self-made wooden double frame was
built (see Figure 2). The speaker cone was connected to a
cheap stereo amplifier.
We found that placing the microphone inside the bass
clarinet’s body was most effective for triggering feedback
with all keys closed. However, using one of the tone holes
to insert the microphone would block a key and limit fin-
gerings. To solve this, we built a plastic extension for the
neck, from which a miniature microphone could be passed
through (see Figure 3). This allowed us to test different
microphones with different capsule dimensions. In the final
setup, we used a dynamic super–cardioid miniature micro-
phone. Interestingly, the neck extension had the collateral
effect of introducing a non–linear pitch deviation through-
out the entire range of the instrument and altering the tim-
bre. These aspects were explored in the final piece (see
Section 4.1).
Figure 2: Close-up of the self-made wooden double frame
to attach the loudspeaker to the bass clarinet’s bell. The
speaker cone is screwed to the first frame, and the internal
border of the two frames is lined with foam insulation tape,
self-adhesive, to avoid scratches. The two frames are then
held together with four screws.
3.2 Software
The software implementation is written as a SuperCollider5
[23] patch that can be run on any computer connected to a
standard soundcard (see Figure 4). The patch is based on a
network of feedback delay lines fed by the sound incoming
from the microphone placed in the body of the bass clarinet.
The input is processed undergoing self-regulating mecha-
nisms using adaptive criteria [19] and sent to the speaker
cone placed on the instrument’s bell, thus re–entering into
the microphone. As such, the input is shaped by the in-
strument itself. The augmented bass clarinet and feedback
system thus become one single unity, that shapes itself over
time.
In terms of signal flow, the input audio signal is ana-
lyzed to extract audio features that will be used to allow
the system to self-regulate. In particular, the electronic
patch computes spectral flatness, spectral entropy [16], and
adaptive spectral centroid. The latter, inspired by the work
of Sanfilippo in [20], is a measure of the spectral centroid
5https://supercollider.github.io/

through the neck thanks to a plastic joint made from seg-
ments of PVC pipe (a T-piece with a lateral segment). The
microphone is then plugged with a cylinder of cork.
which dynamically moves trying to minimize the differences
of the RMS spectral regions above and below the centroid.
The measure of the adaptive spectral centroid is used to
drive the centre frequency of a bandpass filter, which band-
width depends on the spectral entropy measure. This signal
feeds the network of feedback lines. The network consists of
two main lines with delays which feed themselves and each
other. The amount of signal added onto itself is regulated
by the flatness measurement. The network also includes two
granulators, with grain size and grain trigger as functions of
the adaptive spectral centroid, spectral flatness, and overall
input amplitude. A final control curve based on negative
feedback is used to prevent the output to saturate.
The patch also provides a graphical user interface (GUI)
(see Figure 5) that displays the adaptive spectral centroid
frequency, the value of the spectral flatness, and the value
of the spectral entropy. The GUI also shows a timer, the
spectrogram of the output sound, and volume levels of input
and output.
4. CASE STUDY: “WYPYM”
After several months of iterative prototyping and fine-
tuning, the final version of the feedback-augmented bass
clarinet was used in several music performances. A mu-
sic piece was also specifically composed for the instrument:
“WYPYM - Were you a part of your mother?”. The title
of the piece is a nod to the paper with the same name,
published in [10], in which the author discusses if a mam-
malian embryo/fetus is a part of the gestating organism, or
merely contained within or surrounded by it. This topic,
apart from all of its biological and physiological consider-

ations, resonated immediately with our project: what is
the relationship between the augmented bass clarinet and
its performer? Where do we set the border between the
sound produced by feedback and its interaction with the
environment? And finally: who is actually part of this en-
vironment?
“WYPYM” attempts to tackle these questions from an
artistic perspective, representing a music exploration of the
relationship between the performer on the augmented bass
clarinet and the feedback system. The speaker cone estab-
lishes the first loop of feedback with the microphone placed
within the body of the instrument. The performer manip-
ulates and modifies this initial feedback loop while playing.
Conversely, the performer is also heavily influenced by the
sounds that are sent back into the instrument by the speaker
cone. Both the performer and feedback system are in a state
of constant adaptation, moving between different regions of
precarious balance.
The final version of the feedback system described in Sec-
tion 3.2, is the result of several stages of creative coding, a
discovery-based process based on code exploration, itera-
tion and reflection [17]. In these stages, the code was tested
in the composer’s studio, where he could confront himself
with the music outcome and self-reflect on the aesthetics
that he tried to embed in the code, and the aesthetics that
was emerging from it. Stable versions of the code were then
deployed to the performer. The two authors repeatedly en-
gaged in a discussion about aesthetic and technical out-
comes, after which the process was iterated with a new ver-
sion of the code. Eventually, the final code of the feedback
system tended to exhibit a somehow temporally dilated han-
dling of sound events. While an appropriate amount of time
is usually necessary for feedback to be activated, it is also
true that the timing of this specific system was influenced
by personal artistic inclinations of the composer who coded
it.
Although “WYPYM” includes a music score, it should be
viewed as a starting point rather than a destination. The
performer is encouraged to independently explore the sys-
tem and discover paths that are particularly interesting,
thus creating their own unique interpretation of the piece.
It can be helpful to begin with simple gestures to become
more familiar with the system: opening and closing keys
without blowing; playing sostenuto pitches to create beat-
ings with the feedback material; working on finding balance
regions; working on the opposite, playing in a region where
the feedback material is not currently located and trying to
force the system to follow the instrument.
The performance of “WYPYM” is constrained by a time
limit of 10 minutes, which serves as a creative challenge to
develop a meaningful and coherent musical evolution within
the given time frame. This constraint becomes a driving
force for the creative process, encouraging the exploration
of new forms and techniques. The emphasis is on listening
and reacting to the electronic system’s response in order to
create a cohesive and dynamic performance. As a matter of
fact, the most important aspect of this piece is to listen to
the electronic system’s reaction and try to create a dialogue
with it. As a result, there is no unique or correct way to
perform it.
4.1 Performance challenges
The augmentation of the instrument and its incorporation
in the above described technological setup offer to the per-
former a number of challenges and points for reflection. A
first set of performance challenges is experienced by the per-
former already when playing acoustically on the augmented
instrument. The lengthening of the instrument neck to ac-
commodate the microphone produces a non-linear pitch de-
viation throughout the range of the instrument. Depending
on the region, this deviation can vary between a minor sec-
ond and a major third from the expected tone (see Figure
6).
Moreover, the instrument’s timbre is slightly transformed
by the presence of the preparation. To the trained ear, the
augmented bass clarinet sounds a bit less concrete and de-
fined than an ordinary one. This is due to the heterogene-
ity of the materials that we used for the neck extension,
and can be experienced by listening to the full recording of
“WYPYM” (see Appendix A).
It is important to bear in mind that this collaboration
was born in an artistic research context set out to explore
the artistic potential of clarinet preparation, a defamiliaris-
ing practice par excellence. For this reason, we not only ac-
cepted these deviations from the instrument norm (in terms
of pitch and partially timbre) but fully embraced them as
additional challenging and enriching elements of our work.
On the other hand, a detuned bass clarinet can be chal-
lenging when trying to react extemporaneously to feedback
sounds. The performer must identify the note, find the
correct fingering on the detuned instrument, and play the
desired pitch. This process requires extra effort from the
performer and may not be suitable for all players or per-
formative contexts. To address this, the performer initially
practiced with the support of the tuning chart until the re-
sulting sounds became more familiar. She then focused her
attention on some pitches that seemed to trigger the feed-
back better than others, and annotated fingering patterns
that proved to be particularly effective in this respect.
The greatest challenge for the performer is the very pres-
ence of the feedback, of an autonomous sound that runs
through the whole body of the instrument and up until the
performer’s mouth cavity. The performer can filter and, to
a certain extent, control the feedback sound by modifying
the acoustic properties of the clarinet as a resonant tube.
This can be achieved by opening and closing finger holes,
using the mouth cavity as a resonant chamber, or using
the position of the tongue to control and block the upper
end of the clarinet. The feedback sound is perceived from
the performer’s position as a quasi-autonomous wave which
grows within the clarinet bore, at times gently, at times ex-
tremely forcefully – in fact, when detaching the mouth from
the mouthpiece, the performer felt air blown strongly out
of the instrument through the mouthpiece tip.
The actions operated by the performer and the instruc-
tions computed by the patch shape and combine the two
sounds in a multitude of different ways. They can blend
smoothly, create beatings, or clash violently. Together,
these sounds create a sort of metasound, not clearly identi-
fiable as either an ordinary clarinet or pure electronics. As
a matter of fact, this unique resulting sound is the prod-
uct of the containing and filtering effect of several inter-
connected bodies: the “body” of the instrument (its bore),
the performer’s one, and the technical objects that form
the feedback system. This makes it practically impossible,
even for the performer while playing, to clearly determine
the source of certain sounds, especially in more agitated or
loud moments.
At the same time, the perception of one’s body and sur-
roundings while playing is dilated by the use of feedback:
in particular, this setting brings the well-known role of the
fingers and mouth cavity as filters to a new level of complex-
ity and interest. But even more importantly, the feedback-
augmented bass clarinet questions and breaks down the
traditional hierarchy of roles between the performer and
Figure 6: Tuning chart for the augmented bass clarinet, starting from the lowest possible note and moving upwards in a
chromatic scale for three octaves. The lengthening of the instrument neck to accommodate the microphone produces a non
linear pitch deviation throughout the range of the instrument. In the chart, the first staff shows the expected pitch, while the
second displays the actual resulting sound. The colored lines represent deviation from the expected pitch expressed in intervals.
Depending on the region, this deviation can vary from a minor second (m2) to a major third (M3).
the instrument, that conventionally considers the performer
as the active part in the process and relegates the instru-
ment to a more passive function. The feedback-augmented
bass clarinet presents then an ideal setting to disprove this
usual paradigm, since both the performer and the feedback-
augmented bass clarinet are alternately “active” (generating
sound, proposing materials) and “passive” (filtering sound,
reacting to the materials) parts in the creative process.
5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we present “WYPYM”, a study for aug-
mented bass clarinet and feedback system. The feedback-
augmented bass clarinet extends the traditional approach
to classical bass clarinet performance, utilizing feedback as
a means to expand the creative potential of both the per-
former and the composer, fostering a dynamic and collabo-
rative process of music co-creation, not only between artists,
but also between artists and computers.
The collaboration between the performer on the aug-
mented bass clarinet and the feedback system, exemplified
in the performance of “WYPYM” described in Section 4,
is integral to the creation of the final outcome. The per-
former’s actions and the system’s responses are inextrica-
bly linked, to the point that it becomes impossible to sep-
arate the performer from the computational system. The
performer and the system co-create the final performance,
with both playing equally important roles in shaping the
outcome. This highlights the unique nature of this type
of performance, where the traditional distinctions between
performer and instrument, and between performer and com-
poser, are blurred.
Lastly, this work also demonstrates the potential for in-
novation in music performance through the use of low-cost,
easily accessible resources, both in terms of hardware and
software, highlighting the DIY approach that can be poten-
tially replicated by any bass clarinetist 6.
Through the performance of “WYPYM” we also identi-
fied some areas of further investigation. As discussed in
Section 4.1, some of those are of technical nature (like the
non-linear pitch deviation), or of more performative nature
(the co-acting with the feedback sounds). Other areas of
improvement relate to the feedback system itself: although
the time constraints described in Section 4 served as a cre-
ative challenge, they also had the effect of revealing some
limitations in terms of responsiveness of the system. As a
matter of fact, the system showed a tendency for temporally
dilated music actions. Constraining the performance to 10
minutes required then for some ad-hoc adjustments in the
code to make it more responsive.
To conclude, the performance of “WYPYM” served as an
artistic and technical evaluation of the feedback-augmented
bass clarinet by the two authors, showing its potentialities
and weaknesses. The latter will be addressed in future it-
erations and developments of the project. Future work will
also include more explorations of the augmented instrument
with additional musicians.
