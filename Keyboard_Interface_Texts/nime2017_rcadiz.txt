ABSTRACT
The Arcontinuo is an electronic musical instrument designed
from a perspective based in the study of their potential
users and their interaction with existing musical interfaces.
Arcontinuo aims to change the way electronic music is per-
formed, as it is capable of incorporating natural and er-
gonomic human gestures, allowing the musician to engage
with the instrument and as a result, enhance the connec-
tion with the audience. Arcontinuo challenges the notion of
what a musical gesture is and goes against traditional ways
of performing music, by proposing a concept that we call
smart playing mapping, as a way of achieving a better and
more meaningful performance.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Arcontinuo1 is an electronic musical instrument that
was conceived with the intention of overcoming some of the
diﬃculties of other instruments that have failed in getting
a consistent place in the musical scene. Its creation was
based on a model founded in concepts of interaction design
research and narrative identity [1].
This need for a radical innovation in the way electronic
musical instruments are designed and conceived has been
the motivation to develop our research, consolidating a mul-
tidisciplinary team of designers, engineers and musicians
who over the last seven years has been working on this
new electronic musical controller/instrument. It is impor-
tant to note that our research and development process has
been guided by an epistemological disciplinary approach
and methodology, focused in the subject-object interaction
[2], in order to understand meanings as useful drivers to
deﬁne both the shape and the technology of the product.

2. FEATURES
We have developed an electronic musical instrument capa-
ble of incorporating natural human gestures, allowing the
musician to engage with the instrument and as a result,
enhance the connection with the audience. Electronic mu-
sic today, is being played through interfaces made of a se-
ries of knobs, faders and other kinds of buttons that don’t
necessarily allow for the interpreter to create an expressive
person-instrument interaction, nor use natural movements
to create their musical inspiration in a continuous way. We
believe that this interaction ampliﬁes the engagement of the
audience with the performance.
The Arcontinuo is an electronic musical instrument that
belongs to the controller category. It contains a curved sur-
face which is posed/strapped over the shoulders and allows
for an ergonomic coupling with the user. The surface is 3D,
resilient, elastic and continuous, allowing for ﬂuid execu-
tion. Arcontinuo has 3 axes which are fully programmable
(x,y,z), allowing the ﬁngers to move along the surface to
execute the music, where z is the pressure axis. This key
factor enhances the dynamic range and gives versatility and
musical expressiveness to the instrument. We are currently
on our third prototype iteration, and we hope to reach a
market-ready version of the instrument in the short time.
3. PROTOTYPES
We have conducted an iterative validation process, which
begun with the ﬁrst functional prototype (Arcontinuo 416).
This instrument is described in some detail in [1]. As shown
in ﬁgure 1, this ﬁrst version was made of wood with a curved
execution surface covered by polyester. This version com-
municated with a computer using a serial connector (RS-
232) and all the data processing was done by an Arduino
micro-processor.

out of wood and polyester.
After a hardware and software redesign stage, we con-
structed a second functional prototype (Arcontinuo 520),
499
as seen in ﬁgure 2. This version is made of aluminum and
covered with a sandwich of silicon and lycra. This version
had two ways of connecting to a computer, by a standard
USB connector, but also via a wireless ethernet connection.
The software runs on a Raspberry Pi computer. In a similar
fashion as with the ﬁrst prototype, all the data processing
was done by a PIC micro-processor.

of aluminum, silicone and lycra.
We are now in the ﬁnal stages of producing the third
prototype (Arcontinuo 1512), shown in ﬁgure 3. In this
version, the complete instrument is covered by polyester
and the skeleton is 3D printed. All the electronic processing
in this version is considerably faster, as it is built using
FPGAs instead of micro-processors. This version will allow
for wireless, MIDI and standard USB connections. Also, the
sensing technology has been improved, allowing for much
accurate ﬁnger recognition algorithms.

printed and covered by polyester.
One important aspect we have paid considerable atten-
tion since the second prototype, are the variety of perfor-
mance options that this surface allows for. Figure 4 displays
all ﬁve possible performance modes of the instrument.
For a full account of the design process, we refer the
reader to [2].

4. MAPPING
It is not a trivial task to decide how to play a continuous
3D surface. Many questions arises when you are confronted
with this situation, such as: Do we still need to consider the
concept of key?, What is a musical event?, or What is the
relationship between ﬁnger’s gestures and musical events?
After several years of research, we have decided to let
the user deﬁne how he interacts with the instrument. This
means that the whole instrument surface is adjustable and
customizable based on the user’s needs. We called this ap-
proach smart playing mapping, which allows each user, us-
ing some of our software tools, to adapt and decide how the
surface of the instrument is best performed 2.
For example, the Arcontinuo can be used as a gesture
controller, where the musician triggers certain actions based
on how he interacts with the 3D surface. But at the same
time, it can also be performed in much more similar ways
as traditional interfaces, such as the keyboard or a guitar,
are played.
