ABSTRACT
This paper is about creating digital musical instruments
where a predictive neural network model is integrated into
the interactive system. Rather than predicting symbolic
music (e.g., MIDI notes), we suggest that predicting future
control data from the user and precise temporal information
can lead to new and interesting interactive possibilities. We
propose that a mixture density recurrent neural network
(MDRNN) is an appropriate model for this task. The predic-
tions can be used to ﬁll-in control data when the user stops
performing, or as a kind of ﬁlter on the user’s own input.
We present an interactive MDRNN prediction server that
allows rapid prototyping of new NIMEs featuring predictive
musical interaction by recording datasets, training MDRNN
models, and experimenting with interaction modes. We il-
lustrate our system with several example NIMEs applying
this idea. Our evaluation shows that real-time predictive
interaction is viable even on single-board computers and
that small models are appropriate for small datasets.

1. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we consider how mixture density recurrent
neural networks (MDRNNs) [1, 7] can be applied to real-time
gestural prediction in new interfaces for musical expression
(NIMEs) and present an interactive system for training and
applying MDRNNs to a broad range of NIMEs. Research
applying deep learning to music generation is rapidly ap-
pearing, but few of these systems have been applied in the
service of real-time musical performance. We feel that deep
neural networks (DNNs) can extend creative possibilities for
NIME performers and designers; however, these users need
DNN models that are appropriate for typical NIME-data,
and better tools to allow rapid-prototyping and creative
exploration with these models.

Figure 1: Our interactive musical prediction system
allows NIMEs to be integrated with a mixture den-
sity recurrent neural network (MDRNN) that can
support or accompany a human performance.
Present work in musical AI is usually focussed on high-
level symbolic music; however, most NIME control data
is better represented as low-level continuous sensor values.
We propose to use MDRNNs to model this data, including
time-deltas between each reading. This approach has the ad-
vantage of modelling music at the embodied [12] control level;
such models imitate performing on instruments, not com-
posing music. Another advantage is in representing rhythms
absolutely—as a sequence of real-valued time-deltas—rather
than being limited to a sixteenth-note grid. MDRNNs have
previously been applied to control data in sketching [8] and
handwriting [7], both creative tasks.
We have developed an interactive musical prediction sys-
tem (IMPS), to accelerate development of musical MDRNN
models that predict musical control data in real-time during
performance (see Figure 1). This system assists with data
collection, model training, and real-time inference. IMPS
connects to typical NIME software and devices via a sim-
ple open sound control (OSC) interface and can apply an
MDRNN through a number of new predictive interaction
paradigms to accompany or support performers. This tool
provides a new solution for MDRNN-based NIME develop-
ment for artists and computer musicians. We imagine that
artists could train MDRNN models on small datasets of
interaction data, tailored to commercial or DIY interfaces
applied in their practice. While small models may not rep-
resent all possible musical interactions, they might perform
well enough to imitate aspects of an artist’s style.
The main contributions of this research are the novel
IMPS system that assists with data-collection, training, and
real-time application of MDRNNs. We discuss the design of
this system, and in particular the advantages of an MDRNN
model over other popular DNNs. Our evaluation is focussed
on the training and application of this system in real-time
performance. We describe a number of example NIMEs
developed using these tools, and show that incorporation
of real-time MDRNN predictions is feasible on even single-
board computers such as the Raspberry Pi.

mixer sensors or touchscreen data.
2. MACHINE LEARNING IN NIMES
Machine learning (ML) has been a part of NIME designs
since at least the early 1990s [11]. More recently, the adop-
tion of ML algorithms into NIMEs has accelerated due to
frameworks such as Wekinator [4], SARC EyesWeb Cata-
logue [5] or ml.lib [2], that allow training and application
of ML algorithms through a GUI or computer music tools
such as Max or Pd.
ML has typically been applied in NIMEs for two tasks:
mapping from gesture to high-level synthesiser commands,
and modelling of ongoing musical processes [14]. On the
mapping side, classiﬁcation algorithms and shallow NNs have
been useful for mapping multidimensional control data such
as wind instrument keys [18] to musical notes or high level
gestures. Modelling algorithms such as Markov models [17]
or factor oracles [13], have been used to develop systems
that learn to imitate musical styles, or interact with an
improvising musician. These modelling systems usually
operate on high-level musical notes or acoustic phrases, and
as a result have not been as applicable to data from the
multiple continuous controllers of many NIMEs.
2.1 Deep Neural Networks for Music
In recent years much research on musical applications of
DNNs has appeared (see [19] for a survey). Artiﬁcial neural
networks (ANNs) process data by applying simple math-
ematical transformations grouped into units, inspired by
neurons in the brain. The strength of connections between
units, how much data is allowed to move between them, are
the parameters of an ANN. By arranging units deeply, into
layers, ANNs be taught to accomplish high-level tasks such
as recognising images and generating musical melodies.
For music applications, multi-layered recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM)
units are often used to learn sequences of symbolic music
data. In RNNs, data can be stored in between computations
and fed back as extra input. This means that RNNs can learn
to understand temporal relationships between sequences of
data that are applied to their inputs [6]. LSTM units are
RNN components that contain an additional memory state
and four internal gates that control how data is stored,
released, retained and “forgotten” from the memory state.
Typical LSTM music models generate music by predicting
one discrete note symbol at a time using MIDI- [10] or text-
inspired representations [19]. Rather than directly predicting
a note, the outputs of these networks form a categorical
(softmax) probability distribution from which one discrete
option can be sampled. The temperature (or diversity) of
this distribution can be adjusted to favour the highest scoring
option, to boost the chance of sampling less likely notes.
Symbolic LSTM RNNs can be used to model discrete
musical data (e.g., notes from a piano keyboard on a 16th-
note rhythmic grid), but a diﬀerent architecture is required
to directly predict continuous-valued musical data such
as input from touch sensors. To model touchscreen data,
Hantrakul [9] used a RNN without a stochastically sampled
output. Mixture density networks (MDN) have been applied
to touchscreen performances [15], which preserves stochastic
sampling. That system added direct prediction of rhythm
enabling pauses of arbitrary length, taps, as well as continual
swirls. As will be further explained below, MDNs are highly
applicable to many types of continuous control data, not
just touchscreens.
While tools to deﬁne and train DNNs (e.g., Keras and
TensorFlow) have become more accessible, the lack of a
NIME-focussed toolkit has held back the application of
DNNs within an interactive music context. This research
attempts to ﬁll this gap with an MDRNN prediction system
that can be explored without additional programming.
2.2 Mixture Density RNNs
A mixture density network (MDN) transforms the outputs of
a neural network into the parameters of a Gaussian mixture
model (GMM) [1], as shown in Figure 2. Such a model“mixes”
a number of Gaussian (or normal) distributions (in blue) with
weights corresponding to the likelihood of each components,
to form a more complex distribution (in red). This allows the
model to represent phenomena that appear to be drawn from
multiple distributions. As shown in Figure 2, the MDN’s
output parameters consist of centres ( µ) and scales ( σ) for
each component distribution, and a weight ( π) for each
component. An MDN can be applied to the outputs of an
RNN forming an MDRNN that can be trained on sequential
data such as 2D pen movements for handwriting [7] and
sketches [8], as well as musical touchscreen data [15].
In a creative process such as musical improvisation, mul-
tiple choices for the next note to perform or action to take
could be artistically valid. This suggests that some kind of
multi-modal distribution, such as a GMM, would be appro-
priate to accurately model such a process. An MDRNN thus
forms a useful network for regression problems involving
multiple correct answers, or that require a certain amount
of stochasticity when sampling, as in creative tasks.
One of the complexities of an MDN is the error (loss)
function, used for training, which is derived from the prob-
ability density function of the mixture model. While this
is straightforward for a 1-dimensional [1] or 2D [7] case,
mixtures of higher-dimensional Gaussian distributions are
more complex. Our system, outlined below, makes use of
recent features of TensorFlow to generate a tractable loss
function for arbitrary many dimensions of data.
261
3. SYSTEM DESIGN
Our predictive musical interaction system consists of two
components: a Keras implementation of an MDRNN with
an MDN layer that extends to sequential data of arbitrary
dimension and a set of Python applications to facilitate
data collection, model training, and real-time interactive
prediction. The system is open source1 and operated through
a command line interface that enables these tasks to be
performed within the context of a NIME prototyping and
performance process. This system is designed to allow artists,
as well as machine learning researchers, to apply MDRNNs
to creative work and other applications.
3.1 MDN Layer
Our MDN layer allows the selection of the number of mixture
components and the dimension of the data to be modelled.
Each mixture component is a multivariate Gaussian distri-
bution limited to a diagonal covariance matrix. So for K
components and dimension N, for one prediction, the MDN
generates K mixing coeﬃcients (π), K×N means (µ) and
K×N scales (σ, diagonals of the covariance matrix). This
is illustrated for N = 1, K = 3 in Figure 2 with an example
of the resulting mixture distribution.
The limited covariance matrix means that the loss func-
tion can be easily calculated using TensorFlow Probability’s
Mixture, Categorical, and MultivariateNormalDiag func-
tions. The loss function for an MDN relies on the number of
mixture components as well of the dimension of each com-
ponent, so this function is generated on demand for these
parameters.
3.2 MDRNN
We provide an abstraction, PredictiveMusicMDRNN, for gen-
erating an appropriate MDRNN for learning musical se-
quences. This is constructed using multiple layers of LSTM
units followed by an MDN layer. The number of layers,
LSTM units, mixture components, and distribution dimen-
sions are conﬁgurable hyperparameters, but we suggest that
2-layer networks with 5 mixture components are used. The
abstraction assumes that the ﬁrst dimension of the data will
be used for the time since the previous sample ( dt) and will
thus be positive and nonzero. The other dimensions of the
data are assumed to be between 0 and 1. This means that
to model data with 2 continuous control variables ( x1 and
x2), a 3D MDRNN is required ( dt, x1, x2). Our abstraction
can construct networks for training (unrolled to the correct
training sequence length) and for inference (with sequence
length set to 1, and LSTM state stored in between calcula-
tions), and provides a function to make inferences one at a
time as input data becomes available.
We provide a high-level control of the size of the MDRNN
which allows the user to trade potential learning capacity
for speed of training and inference. Four presets are pro-
vided that change the number of LSTM units as follows:
s–64, m–128, l–256, xl–512. The ‘s’ network has around
50K parameters while the ‘xl’ network has 3M. Further cus-
tomisation to hyperparameters is easily made through a
command line interface.
3.3 Predictive Musical Interaction Controller
The main IMPS application receives interaction messages
from a control interface over OSC (e.g., /interface, x1, x2,
. . . ). All interaction messages are automatically logged to
CSV ﬁles in order to build up a training dataset.
IMPS’ MDRNN module can accept interface messages as
input, performing inference and sampling to produce pre-

sure open) represents predictions physically and

dictions of the user’s next control interaction (as illustrated
in Figure 2). Information from the MDRNN’s input condi-
tions the LSTM layers’ internal states, which means that
predictions are inﬂuenced by previous interactions. The
MDRNN can also perform predictions on top of predictions
by connecting output to input, allowing it to generate new
control signals based on previous experiences. Predictions
are stored internally and sent back to the interface (with
the address /prediction), at the time indicated by the dt
values output by the MDRNN. This allows the MDRNN to
perform arbitrarily timed rests and rhythms.
The input and output of the MDRNN can be connected
in diﬀerent ways to messages from the interface and the
outgoing stream of predicted control values. Given that
messages may arrive faster than MDRNN predictions are
made, IMPS uses concurrent queues to keep up as much as
possible. We have deﬁned four interaction modes in IMPS
to explore these conﬁgurations in performance:
No Predictions. Interface messages condition the MDRNN
memory, but the output predictions are ignored.
Filter. Interface messages condition the MDRNN memory;
output predictions are played as quickly as possible.
Call-and-Response. The MDRNN is conditioned when
the user plays; if the user stops, the MDRNN generates
new control signals until they interact again.
Battle. The user and MDRNN play together, with the
MDRNN continually generating control signals regard-
less of the user’s actions.
These predictive interactions are a starting point for further
research. In particular, they demonstrate that our system
is capable of both mapping (through the ﬁlter interaction),
and modelling (through call-and-response).
4. EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS
In this section we present several NIMEs that integrate our
MDRNN predictive model to demonstrate its ﬂexibility for
a variety of interactive music modalities. These systems
allow the output from the MDRNN to be soniﬁed as well
as represented visually or physically. The systems have
diﬀering degrees of freedom, from one single controller, to
an eight-knob interface. These systems are illustrated in our
video abstract2.
4.1 EMPI
The Embodied Musical Predictive Interface (EMPI) is a
self-contained NIME with a single dimension of continuous
input and output through two physical levers, a Raspberry
Pi, touchscreen, and speaker. EMPI was designed to explore
the simplest predictive musical interactions: where one di-
mension of input is modelled along with time. The MDRNN
model was trained on a 10-minute human performance with

the input lever. The EMPI demonstrates that even a Rasp-
berry Pi can be used for predictions from a small MDRNN
in a real-time situation. In performance, the predictions are
soniﬁed through the EMPI’s speaker as well as physically
represented through the servo-controlled lever, this imbues
the NIME with a sense of independent agency.
4.2 LightPad Block
The Roli LightPad Block (see Figure 4) is a small multi-
touch controller with a ﬂexible pressure sensitive surface
and an LED display. The LightPad’s expressive inputs and
the ability to visually represent these inputs through the
display make it ideal for experimenting with predictive in-
teraction. We developed a Pd patch that communicates
between our predictive interaction system (OSC) and the
LightPad (MIDI over Bluetooth). This allows MIDI mes-
sages from the LightPad, and predictions from the MDRNN
to be mapped to software synthesisers. The LightPad’s LED
display is usually used to illuminate the user’s touches as
well as the state of music software. We feed MDRNN predic-
tions back to the LightPad which are displayed in a diﬀerent
colour. This allows an intuitive view of the user’s actions
and predictive responses during performance.
The LightPad data was applied to a 4D MDRNN ( dt,
x-position, y-position, pressure). Hantrakul previously pre-
sented an RNN LightPad controller [9], however that system
used a deterministic RNN without the ability to predict
when to play the LightPad. Unlike that system, IMPS can
stop swirling and predicts when and where to start a new
touch, a signiﬁcant advantage allowing the performance of
novel rhythms as well as gestures.
4.3 X-Touch Mini
Mixing control surfaces with multitudes of faders and knobs
are common in recording studios as well as in NIME research.
Interfaces with illuminated controls, such as the Behringer
X-Touch Mini, can represent previously recorded data as it
is played back (see Figure 5). We used the X-Touch Mini to
control the parameters of an additive synthesis instrument,
and recorded 10-minutes of performance with this instrument

that comprised 12,000 interactions. This data was used to
train a 9D MDRNN model ( dt, knobs 1–8). In performance,
predictive output can be sent to a synthesis routine as well
as represented visually with the illuminated controls. ML
fader interfaces have previously been demonstrated without
a neural-network powered controller [20]. Unlike Tahiroglu
et al’s research, our system can interpolate between the
many training examples and come up with novel gestures.
5. EV ALUATIONS AND DISCUSSION
Many aspects of predictive music systems can be evaluated
to determine their place in a NIME context; however, a
key question for NIME designers and performers wishing
to apply IMPS would be whether training is fast enough
to keep up with a rapid-prototyping process and predic-
tions are fast enough to keep up with real-time performance.
In this section we evaluate training performance on small
datasets, prediction speed, and strategies for sampling useful
predictions.
We note here that training and inference are very diﬀerent
operations for the MDRNN. In short, while inference only in-
volves computing the output from a single timestep, training
involves unrolling the MDRNN to multiple (our default is 50)
timesteps to calculate the gradients of the loss function, this
is computed in parallel for each member of a training batch
(our default batch size is 64), thus one training step requires
much more computation than one inference calculation.
5.1 Training
Training, as outlined above, is much slower than inference
for DNNs. While training very large DNNs is slow even
on powerful GPUs, the small MDRNNs discussed here can
be trained reasonably quickly on a small dataset, and on
a normal computer. The main hyperparameter to consider
263

= 64) showing little eﬀect on computation speed.
here is the size of the MDRNN compared to the training
dataset; larger MDRNNs have more learning capacity but
are slower to train and may not learn more from a smaller
dataset. By way of example, we consider the LightPad model
discussed in Section 4.2. We trained LightPad models on
two datasets: a very small corpus of 12K touch interactions
(15 minutes of performance), and a larger corpus of 100K
interactions (2 hours). The small corpus takes 70 minutes
to train for 100 epochs (exposures to all examples) on a
MacBook Pro.
Would it help in this case to use a larger network? We
trained 64-, 128-, 256-, and 512-unit networks on each
dataset, and used the loss values to investigate learning
performance as shown in Figure 6 and 7. The training loss
is the average loss over each batch of training examples,
and the validation loss is calculated on a set (10% in our
case) of examples that are held out to evaluate training after
each epoch. Figure 6 shows that all but the 64-unit network
had poor performance against the validation set on the 12K
dataset indicating that the larger networks had overﬁt to
the training data. For the 100K dataset, Figure 7 shows
that both the 64- and 128-unit networks had reasonable val-
idation performance. It is likely that the smaller networks
are most useful for datasets of this size. Early stopping
(an option in IMPS) would have saved much time here by
stopping training after the validation loss failed to improve.
While 70 minutes of training time is more than the mere
seconds required to train Wekinator models [4], we argue
that it does not preclude rapid NIME-prototyping. Similarly
to Wekinator, an MDRNN with our system can be improved
by subsequent retraining. Our predictive interaction system
logs all interactions to facilitate the accumulation of datasets
as a NIME is reﬁned. In our process, models are continu-
ally retrained during NIME creation as more data becomes
available through experimentation and performance.
5.2 Prediction Speed
We benchmarked prediction speed from our MDRNN on four
computer systems: a MacBook Air ( mba, Intel i5 1.8GHz),
MacBook Pro ( mbp, Intel i7 2.6GHz), desktop PC ( gpu,
NVidia GeForce GTX 1080TI), and a Raspberry Pi 3 B+
(rpi, Broadcom BCM2837B0 1.4GHz). The desktop PC
computed MDRNN predictions on the GPU and the other
systems used their CPUs. We examined two aspects of the
MDRNN conﬁguration—the input/output dimension of the
network (between 2 and 9), and the number of LSTM units
in each RNN layer (64, 128, 256, 512). 100 predictions
were performed with each conﬁguration on each system with
the ﬁrst of each test discarded due to time taken for setup
overhead.
Figure 9: Time (mean and SD) taken per prediction
for diﬀerent RNN layer sizes. The time is <10ms
for 64-unit networks on all systems.
The prediction time for a 64-unit per layer MDRNN with
diﬀerent output dimension sizes is shown in Figure 8. This
shows that changing the output dimension from 2 up to 9 has
little impact on computation speed for each computer system.
The ﬁnal MDN layer uses few parameters in comparison to
the RNN layers in the network, so its size has little impact
on computation time. A practical consequence is that it is
feasible to experiment with MDRNN prediction of complex
NIMEs with many dimensions of real-valued input.
The number of LSTM units in each RNN layer has a
much more signiﬁcant impact on the speed of prediction
(Figure 9). The mbp achieved the best speed for the 64 unit
network with a mean of 1.85ms per prediction and a mean
of only 4.51ms on the 512 unit network. This means that
MDRNN predictions could ﬁt within typical expectations for
NIME latency of around 10ms [16] on this system. For gpu,
prediction speed barely changed between 64- (mean=2.85ms)
and 512-unit (mean=2.96ms) networks due to the advantages
of GPU-acceleration for DNN calculations. The rpi saw the
greatest changes in speed, from a mean of 6.69ms on the
64-unit network to 37.64ms on the 512-unit network. While
smaller networks are feasible on the rpi, larger networks may
be too slow in practice.
5.3 Sampling
The output from an MDN is the set of parameters for the
GMM: the weights for each mixture component ( π), and
the means and scales for each multivariate Gaussian ( µ and
σ). Predictions must be generated from these parameters
by sampling from the categorical distribution formed by π,
and then sampling from the Gaussian distribution chosen
by that outcome.
The concept of adjusting the temperature of a categorical
distribution will be familiar to those who have used RNNs
to learn creative sequences such as text or symbolic music.
The MDN’s categorical distribution can be adjusted in the
same way with very low temperature values favouring the
maximum value in the distribution, and high values produc-
ing a more uniform distribution. This adjustment could be
called “π-temperature”. The temperature of the Gaussian
distributions can also be adjusted by scaling the variances
σ. High values result in a wider spread of predictions, and
low values are closer to the selected mean. We call this
“σ-temperature”.
In IMPS, we have found adjusting theσ- and π-temperature
to be very important for making useful predictions. Fig-
ure 5.3 shows touchscreen performances on a 3D ( dt,x,y )
network generated at diﬀerent temperatures. The MDRNN
can end up producing high σs, resulting in jagged output,
but by reducing the σ-temperature to close to zero, we can
264

generate smooth paths. The π-temperature can control the
appearance of diﬀerent gestures to some extent. At low val-
ues, an MDRNN will have trouble changing modes, endlessly
swirling. At very high values, it taps without completing
any signiﬁcant swipes. Exploring how π and σ sampling
temperature can be explored in our predictive interaction
systems is a topic of our future research.
6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have introduced IMPS, an Interactive Musical Prediction
System, that allows an MDRNN model to be applied in any
NIME with continuous control signals. This system has been
demonstrated through predictive interactions with three
interfaces: the custom built EMPI, commercial LightPad,
and X-Touch Mini. Our evaluation has shown that IMPS
is viable for use on normal laptops and even single-board
computers, and provided insight into how the MDRNN
behaves under diﬀerent training and sampling parameters. It
is promising that small, easily trained models seem suﬃcient
to learn smaller datasets; however, future studies could seek
to understand what aspects of a control style are actually
learned and how IMPS might work within a design process.
We think that predictive interaction could be applied
widely in computer music software such as DAWs, synthesis
environments and physical hardware controllers. The success
of tools such as Wekinator [3], and interest in Google’s
Magenta project suggest that artists see the value of applying
ML in their work. The ﬂexibility of IMPS and our MDRNN
design could be ideal for providing predictive interaction
possibilities to these users.
