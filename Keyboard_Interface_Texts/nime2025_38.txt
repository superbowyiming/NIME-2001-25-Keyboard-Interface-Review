Abstract
In line with a sustained community interest in electromagnetic
actuation of musical instruments, we describe practical consider-
ations for Lorentz Force actuation in conductive strings, exempli-
fied by the Sparksichord – an augmented harpsichord that uses
Lorentz Force actuation, optical feedback, and analog circuitry
to sustain vibrations of its brass strings. Electromagnetically-
actuated and feedback instruments have grown increasingly pop-
ular in NIME, though most systems rely on the use of solenoid-
style electromagnetic coils. By running current through the string
itself, Lorentz Force actuation offers an alternate arrangement
of magnets and wire that can afford new modes of interaction, a
broader frequency response, and cheaper implementation. We
aim to empower practitioners with a toolbox for designing and
building actuated instruments of this style and describe our spe-
cific implementation for this instrument.

1 Introduction
A persistent topic of interest in digital musical instrument (DMI)
research is the creation of hybrid acoustic-electronic instruments
based on actuating (i.e. inducing vibrations in) musical instru-
ment strings, membranes, air columns, or other resonant ele-
ments [15, 23, 32]. Actuating physical systems rather than produc-
ing purely synthetic sound offers a range of novel sonic and tac-
tile effects, while also potentially exposing the sound-producing
apparatus for direct manipulation by the performer. Strings are
perhaps the most thoroughly explored of these actuated elements.
The predominant actuation approach in both research and com-
mercial practice involves the use of solenoid-style (cylindrical)
electromagnetic coils driving strings made from steel or other
ferromagnetic materials.
This paper develops the theory and practice of a different
approach to electromagnetic string actuation, building on ear-
lier foundations in the literature [24]. The approach, commonly
known as Lorentz Force actuation , involves an alternate arrange-
ment of magnets, wire, and strings in which the string itself
becomes the primary electrical conductor. Although the arrange-
ment has been described before in patents and papers [ 20, 24],
little documentation for realized musical systems exists. It is most
notably used in Alvin Lucier’s Music on a Long Thin Wire [22]
and has most recently been described within NIME by Schmidt
& Gurevich [35].
Lorentz Force actuation is less explored than coil-based actu-
ation in the realm of musical instruments, perhaps because of
the extensive documentation surrounding coil-actuated projects
by hobbyists and professional practitioners alike, though as this

paper will show, both approaches can be relatively simple to im-
plement with easily available parts. Lorentz Force actuation and
coil-based actuation are not always interchangeable for a given
instrument, and the two approaches have different advantages
and limitations. This paper aims to provide a practical introduc-
tion to Lorentz Force actuation, illustrating its musical utility
through a case study of the Sparksichord, a harpsichord with
48 self-sustaining strings using a fully analog configuration of
Lorentz Force actuation and optical vibration sensing.
2 Background
2.1 Related Work
Over the past decade, the NIME community has seen new works
and discourse surrounding electromagnetic actuation and/or feed-
back musical instruments. Many of these developments and dis-
cussions describe implementations of electromagnetic actuation,
most of which utilize coil-transducer style actuation. Coil-based
augmentations largely fall into three categories; (1) using an
electromagnet to drive a ferrous sound-making element with a
solenoid coil [19, 20, 23], (2) using an electromagnet to drive a per-
manent magnet attached to a non-ferrous sound-making element
with a solenoid coil [1, 10], or (3) using a transducer mounted to
an instrument body to indirectly vibrate the sound-making ele-
ments through acoustic or mechanical coupling [18, 26, 31, 34, 37].
Other methods of actuation and feedback that do not rely on
electromagnetic coils nor Lorentz Force actuation to excite a
sound-generating element are also possible (i.e., piezo-element
actuation [9]) but less common.
Keyboard instruments have been of particular interest to elec-
tromagnetic actuation practitioners, with documentation of an
electromagnetically-actuated piano dating back to the 19th cen-
tury [13]. Some more recent works actuate their strings or tonebars
by driving strings or magnets with synthesized tones, as does the
Magnetic Resonator Piano [ 23], Electromagnetically-prepared
piano [ 7], and the EMVibe [ 10], with some practitioners ex-
perimenting with more tightly-controlled forms of feedback to
achieve infinite-sustain as done in the Electromagnetically Sus-
tained Rhodes piano [36]. Though many of these actuated instru-
ments don’t require the player to be in direct physical contact
with the vibrating element, many newer actuated instruments
actually necessitate it, introducing a new paradigm of inher-
ently haptic instruments that rely on chaotic, unpredictable feed-
back that foster a greater sense of agency from the instrument
[11, 15, 18, 26, 28, 30, 34, 35, 38].
In the past couple years, we have seen a number of new com-
mercial developments utilizing electromagnetic actuation (other
than the renowned eBow [ 19]), such as Korg Berlin’s Electro-
Acoustic Synth1 and SoundStone’s String Armonica2, as well as
DIY and hobbyist efforts to share open-source knowledge and de-
signs for sustainer systems3, suggesting an ever-growing interest
in these instruments that extends beyond academia.
2.2 Electromagnetic Actuation Overview
2.2.1 Transducers: Sensors & Actuators.
Transducers are devices that convert one form of energy into
another. For example, microphones are a form of transducer that
first converts acoustic energy into mechanical energy, and then
mechanical energy to electrical signals. These can be thought of
1https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpsXy8z0RGA
2https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mOhg0gz9DI
3https://bitbucket.org/metalmarshmallow/mm-diy-sustainer/src/main/
as ‘sensors’. Conversely, speakers use electrical energy to induce
mechanical motion in an element and consequently generate
acoustic pressure, and can generally be thought of as ‘actuators’.
Dynamic-coil microphones and loudspeakers are two common
examples of coil-based sensors and actuators (respectively), and
they work via the principles of electromagnetic induction.
For example, as you speak into a microphone, the acoustic pres-
sure generated by your vocal cords excites a thin diaphragm with
many windings of copper wire (called the voice-coil) attached.
This diaphragm and coil pair vibrates with this excitement near a
permanent magnet such that the coil is subject to a changing mag-
netic field, which in turn induces an alternating electric current
in the coil per the laws of magnetic induction and proportional
to the diaphragm was subject to. This phenomenon also works
in reverse, as in the case of a dynamic coil speaker; applying an
alternating electric current to a voice-coil near a permanent mag-
netic field induces vibration in the coil and diaphragm pair, and in
turn creates audible acoustic pressure. In either case, the strength
of electromagnetic induction scales linearly with the number of
turns of wire in the voice coil, increasing signal strength while
keeping things physically compact.
2.2.2 Lorentz Force Sensing and Actuation.
Now one can imagine a special case of this voice coil and perma-
nent magnet combination where the coil is unwound (number
of turns = 1) and stretched out but still nearby the permanent
magnet; electromagnetic principles are still in play such that
moving the wire nearby the magnet will induce a voltage across
the wire, and running an electric current through the wire will
induce a force on the wire. The force felt by the wire is known as
the Lorentz Force, and is the namesake of this actuation method.
The former case – vibrating a string in a magnetic field – is
well documented as a string-sensing method by scientists and
practitioners [33] and is even available commercially as a pickup
method for classical stringed instruments4.
2.2.3 Sustaining, Damping, and Transformations.
The ever-popular eBow device [19] popularized a musical effect
probably most well known as ‘infinite sustain’. This device, when
held close to a vibrating steel guitar string, uses the principles
of electromagnetics to add energy to the string in such a way
that its vibrations are sustained indefinitely (Figure 2). The fun-
damental requirements for a feedback infinite-sustain system are
(a) a sensor, (b) an actuator, and (c) a closed-loop gain between
the sensing and actuating methods that adds enough energy to
the system to allow vibrational energy to accumulate. Without
sufficient gain, the sustain of an instrument may be increased or
augmented but will eventually fade out.
To augment the natural resonances of the sound-making ele-
ment – in most cases a metal string – this feedback system needs
to do more than simply add energy; extensive effort has gone into
exploring the active damping of sound-making elements – a sig-
nificantly more complex challenge than infinite sustain [3, 4, 40].
To achieve effective damping, phase coherence between the sen-
sor and actuator is required to remain stable across the desired
audio bandwidth [6, 20]. Achieving phase coherence has been
explored in a few different manners: ultra-low latency processing
where the time delay is negligible; with additional processing to
add a correction delay [7, 8]; and collocated or nearly-collocated
sensing and actuation [6, 20]. Additionally, strings vibrate on two
axes while most sensors and actuators only interact with a single

axis, thus requiring the use of multi-axis sensing and actuation
to offer the most responsive control as explored by [20] and [4].
Research efforts have also explored the active transformation
of the feedback loop, allowing a system to alter harmonic content
and timbre, sometimes to the point of making a convincing imi-
tation of a synthesized tone or acoustic instrument. For example,
a string may be driven such that the harmonics present in the
string emulate that of a triangle wave or flute [ 3, 5, 20, 21], or
harmonics may be altered to vibrate at frequencies they do not
naturally resonate at [9].
Electromagnetic coil sensing and actuating are well-documented
and the most common method for achieving sustained vibrations,
though feedback control is far from limited to coils; Optical, Mag-
netic, and piezoelectric transducers can fill the role of sensing,
while Lorentz Force Actuation or piezoelectric transducers can
be used to actuate.
3 Technical Implementation of Lorentz Force
Actuation
This section contains an explanation of each aspect of a practical
implementation of open-loop Lorentz Force Actuation, closed-
loop infinite sustain, and higher-order control of a string. The
cumulative force felt by a charged particle exposed to electric
and magnetic fields is known as the Lorentz Force . A special
case of the Lorentz Force (sometimes referred to as the Laplace
Force) describes the magnetic force felt by a current-carrying
wire exposed to a magnetic field:
F = 𝐼L × B (1)
where F is the force vector felt by the wire, 𝐼 is the current
through the wire, B is the magnetic field vector, and L is the
length of the wire exposed to the magnetic field.

3.1 Open-Loop String Actuation
3.1.1 Power Amplifier.
A power amplifier takes a relatively small electric signal and
amplifies it to a sufficient level to drive an element such as a
speaker coil. A powered device like this is typically designed to
drive the copper coils wound within a speaker, but as in Alvin
Lucier’s Music on a Long Thin Wire [22], they can also be used
to drive a tensioned, conductive string (Figure 3). The power
amplifier modulates the value of current 𝐼 in equation 1.
3.1.2 Permanent Magnets and their placement.
As seen in equation 1, the magnitude of force F on a string at
any given moment is proportional to the current 𝐼 through the
string, the strength of the magnetic field B from the permanent
magnet, and the length of the string in the field L. In the context
of an actuated string, this intuitively suggests that the stronger
pull-force a magnet has, the stronger the actuation force and
the louder the string vibrates. Similarly, the higher the current
through the string, the louder the string vibrates.
The strength and timbre of actuation is highly dependent on
the placement of the permanent magnet. In the case of open-
loop actuation where an arbitrary signal is applied to the string,
the analogy of guitar or harpsichord plucking position is useful.
That is, the closer to the center of the vibrating portion of the
string is plucked, the more prominent the fundamental frequency
and lower harmonics of the string are, and the closer to the
termination point (nut or bridge) the string is plucked, the more
emphasis on the higher harmonics. Likewise, placing the magnet
towards the center of the string favors the fundamental frequency
and lower harmonics of the string, whereas placement towards
the nut or bridge emphasizes higher harmonics.
3.1.3 Open Loop Actuation, String Resistivity, & Heat Buildup.
Putting these ingredients together, it is possible to drive a string
with an oscillator tuned to match the string’s frequency. In fact,
this is the premise of Hanson, Anderson, and Macomber’s 1994
experiment investigating nonlinearities in harpsichord string
dynamics [17]. However, depending on the material properties
of the string, some of the actuation current may be dissipated
as heat in the string’s internal resistance, introducing thermal
expansion of the string and causing it to lengthen and reduce its
tension. This brings the frequency of the string down causing
it to no longer match the frequency of the open-loop actuation
signal [24].
The resistivity of some conductive metals is shown in Figure
4 5. Metals such as yellow and red brass are much less resistive
than iron and steel, which means they are more robust to string
detuning. It should be noted, however, that heat treatment or
work-hardening of the string material affects resistance [2, 12],
where annealed metals will typically have higher conductivity
than hardened metals. Heat-treating or other processes that in-
crease the strength of a metal string are often required for strings
to withstand the tensions typically found in musical instruments,
so it is fair to assume any wire intended for stringing instruments
will have slightly greater resistivity than in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Resistivity of conductive materials used in
musical instrument strings (as reported by the CSNDT
dataset by Eddy Current Technology Incorporated)
The intensity of detuning is proportional to its heat buildup
and therefore proportional to the resistivity inherent to the string:
𝑄 = 𝐼2𝑅𝑡
where 𝑄= heat buildup, 𝐼 = electric current, 𝑅= resistance, and 𝑡
= time. Though this formula suggests that the string may heat up
and continue to detune indefinitely as electric current is applied,
there is an element of heat dissipation into the surrounding air
and any other materials the string is in contact with6. In other
words, for a real system, the detuning effect from heat buildup
eventually finds equilibrium with the heat dissipation, stabilizing
the tuning for a given electric current at a given room tempera-
ture.
To minimize the effects of string detuning, the following rec-
ommendations are made:
• Minimize resistivity of the string : Highly conductive
materials such as brass will be more resilient to thermal de-
tuning. Thicker diameter wire of the same material allows
for a larger cross-sectional area, also increasing conduc-
tivity.
• Minimize the current through the string : Though this
will yield a lower actuation force on its own, a similar
actuation force can be achieved by bringing the permanent
magnet closer to the string or using a stronger permanent
magnet to increaseB. However, also note that the center of
string has a wider displacement than near its termination
points, meaning a magnet can only get so close before
buzzing.
• Or, if infinite sustain is the goal, then introduce closed-
loop feedback as outlined in the following section.
3.2 Closed-Loop String Actuation
If one’s goal is to sustain vibrations of the string, a form of closed-
loop feedback can be implemented to improve actuation effi-
ciency and create a sustain that is robust to pitch change by
sensing the string’s own vibration and using that signal for actu-
ation. The following section outlines practical considerations for
such a system.
6It should be noted that for the relatively low-power (5 Watt, 1 Amp maximum)
systems explored in this paper, a given string’s heat buildup was usually imper-
ceptible to the touch and posed no apparent danger to the musicians, strings, or
instruments involved.
3.2.1 String Vibration Sensing.
To achieve an infinitely-sustaining feedback system, some method
of sensing the string’s vibration is required. Probably the most
popular method for sensing string vibrations is an electromag-
netic coil such as a guitar pickup. However, as mentioned previ-
ously, this method of sensing is only applicable to ferrous strings
such as iron and steel because pickups rely on the magnetizabil-
ity of the sensed string. For non-ferrous strings, other sensing
methods are possible. For example, a piezo pickup could be used
to sense a string’s force [4, 16], or an optical pickup can be used
to sense the string’s position [4, 17, 35? ] as seen in Figure 5.

3.2.2 Signal Processing for Better Phase Coherency.
As hinted above, not all sensors sense the same property of a
sound-making element. When feeding a string sensor’s signal
back into itself, one may find it beneficial to consider what exactly
the sensor is measuring: a string’s position, velocity, or accel-
eration? The implications of the sensing method on feedback
actuation may not be initially obvious, but careful considera-
tion and signal processing can increase system efficiency to use
less power and increase headroom before detuning occurs. For
Lorentz Force actuation, using a signal proportional to a string’s
own velocity appears to be most effective.
Position Signal: Optical sensors are a less common form
of vibration sensing than coil or piezo pickups in the realm of
musical instruments, but they have been explored commercially7,
academically [4, 17, 35], and by hobbyists [? ] alike. This sensing
method produces a voltage proportional to the displacement of a
string from its resting, unperturbed position on one of its two
vibrational axes.
Actuating a string with its own position signal can achieve
an infinite sustain, but this is not a particularly efficient use of
power to sustain resonance. Pushing a child on a swing set is a
wonderfully intuitive analogy to a string sustainer, where the
pusher adds external energy to the system to maintain the reso-
nance of the swinging child. If one were to push the child with
an increasingly greater force as it gets further from the resting
center point (as in, using the child’s position to dictate pushing
force), the inefficiency immediately becomes apparent: while the
child is on their upswing, the pusher starts out pushing gently,
gradually pushing harder as the child moves further from the rest-
ing point of the swing. However, even once the child has reached
the peak and begins to swing backwards, the pusher continues to
attempt to push forward through their downswing, resisting the
child’s return. This half-cycle repeats in the other direction and
7https://www.light4sound.com and

The Sparksichord NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia
resonant motion might be sustained, but a considerable amount
of unnecessary work is being performed.
Velocity Signal: Instead consider the scenario where the
swinging child is pushed with a force proportional to their trav-
eling velocity: as they approach the peak of a swing cycle, slow
down, and change directions, the pusher eases off and changes
the direction of their push as well. The force from the pusher
is now supporting the motion throughout the entirety of each
resonant cycle, pushing the hardest when the child is moving
fastest.
Much like the swing set example, it is more efficient to sus-
tain a string’s vibrations by only adding energy to the string
while it is already in motion. By taking the first-order derivative
of a position reading and feeding that back into the string, we
observed that this could yield the same sustained volume at a
fraction of the actuation power. However, we reiterate that sus-
tain was absolutely possible without differentiation – this is not
a fundamental requirement but rather a form of optimization
(and an especially useful one if a system is experiencing detun-
ing issues or power limitations). Solenoid coil sensors such as
guitar pickups need no further processing to achieve low-power
sustain because the sensed signal is already proportional to the
appropriate velocity signal, explaining why this processing can
typically be ignored in a feedback system that uses coils for both
sustaining and actuating.
Acceleration Signal: Another common form of sensing used
in musical instruments is a piezo-electric element. These sen-
sors output a voltage proportional to the force exerted by the
string if the string is sitting directly on the sensor (as is done in
[4, 16]), which is proportional to the acceleration of the string.
Presumably, this signal could be integrated to achieve a velocity
signal.
3.2.3 Closed-loop Sensor and Magnet Placement.
In the case of closed-loop feedback actuation, sensor placement
and magnet placement both play critical but less predictable roles.
Similar to open-loop actuation, placing the magnet near the nut
or bridge favors and emphasizes higher harmonics, and towards

the center of the string tends to emphasize lower harmonics.
The result of sensor placement is similar, with sensing towards
the center being more fundamental-heavy than sensing near the
nut or bridge. In practice, sensing towards the center of a string
can prove impractical since this is where the displacement of a
vibrating string is greatest. For example, an optical sensor with
a limited working range may produce a distorted signal when
placed more centrally. Overall, the harmonic result of a closed-
loop sustain can vary drastically with sensor placement, magnet
placement/polarity, and actuation signal polarity (e.g., inverting
the magnet’s pole can damp out the fundamental frequency and
emphasize a higher harmonic instead, similar to an eBow’s ‘har-
monic’ mode). Although Co-location of the sensor and magnet
should theoretically yield the most predictable and controlled
version of infinite sustain (as explained and demonstrated by
Ierymenko and Berdahl [6, 20]), practical experimentation with
placement is effective for exploring timbre, and the nonlineari-
ties introduced by non-collocated control, sensor distortions, and
analog circuitry may yield sonically desirable feedback.
3.3 Dynamic Control via Amplitude
Limitation
Amplitude limitation placed in the feedback loop can add a level
of control and dynamics to the string sustain so that feedback is
not simply On or Off. Note that this is different from simply con-
trolling the gain of the feedback loop, but is instead an amplitude
limiter – a special case of compressor – that prevents feedback
from building over a threshold, where the threshold becomes the
parameter that can be controlled dynamically.
This introduces an additional loop of feedback that provides
the system awareness of a string’s current vibrational amplitude
as seen by the optical sensor via a volume detector. Consequently,
the loop only adds energy to the system when the current am-
plitude measurement is below the threshold value to the vol-
ume comparator, and stops adding energy when has reached the
threshold value. The result is the ability to control the amplitude
of sustained vibrations on a string (Figure 6).

4 Case Study: The Sparksichord
In the summer of 2023, University of Michigan School of Music
Associate Professor Dr. Joseph Gascho reached out inquiring if
the same concepts used in the Magnetic Resonator Piano [ 23]
could be applied to a harpsichord. The initial goal of the Spark-
sichord was to use the existing keyboard interface to control
the sustaining of the string corresponding to each string. Suc-
cessful experiments on multiple different harpsichords strung
in brass followed with several iterations of analog electronics
development. Once ready to augment a full harpsichord, a 1970’s
Zuckermann ‘Z-Box’ Harpsichord already owned by the second
author became the subject of our augmentation. Audiovisual
documentation of our specific implementation can be found in
the accompanying github repository8, alongside our PCB design
files, bill of materials, LTSpice circuit simulations, and more.
4.1 System Overview
The Sparksichord is a practical implementation of a 4-octave,
48-channel Lorentz Force sustainer system. Though only 48 of
its 57 strings are actuated, all of its strings are brass opposed
to a more traditional split of brass, iron, and steel. Its original
keyboard is continuously sensed with optical sensors to control
the volume of each string’s actuation.

Figure 7: Full system diagram for one string of the Sparksichord
A diagram of the signal flow of each string actuator channel is
shown in Figure 7. In addition to being controlled by the harpsi-
chord’s own keyboard manual, it can alternatively be controlled
with on-board potentiometers or control voltages from external
sources such as modular synthesizers via 3.5mm mono jacks.
The strings can either be in sustain mode , where they are fed a
signal from their respective optical pickups, or audio actuation
mode, where an arbitrary audio signal can be fed into the string.
Each channel can be fed an independent signal via 3.5mm mono
jacks, or a global stereo signal can be sent to all 48 channels of
the board, where each channel can be switched to the 1st (’left’)
or 2nd (’right’) audio channel via a 3.5mm stereo jack. While a
key press for a given channel activates the sustainer feedback
in sustain mode , the same key press control allows an external
arbitrary audio signal to excite its respective string when inaudio
actuation mode . The mode is can be changed with the flip of the
’mode’ switch, which is an independent control for each string.
4.2 Optical String Sensing
An array of ITR20403 optical sensors is used to individually sense
the vibrations of each string, and the sensing circuit for each
channel is similar to the schematic described by Dave Corsie
(https://www.davecorsie.com/optical-pickup-blog). The sensors
are mounted on an aluminum rail that is fastened to the harpsi-
chord’s original jack rail (Figure 9).

4.3 String Signal Processing, Power Amplifier,
& Power Resistors
Figure 8 depicts one of the four 12-channel circuit boards. Each
channel of the board contains an optical gain, differentiation, and
limiter circuit. Various jacks, switches, and potentiometers allow
a player/composer flexibility in how each string behaves.
The op-amp differentiator circuit in Figure 10 is used for ob-
taining our string velocity signal, where R18 and C3 are essential
for differentiation and R15 and C5 are added for circuit stabil-
ity. The voltage-controlled limiter circuit was based on a diode
compression circuit designed by Moritz Klein9. Thorough doc-
umentation detailing the details of its implementation can be
found online10, and our implementation is provided in Appendix
A.
Figure 10: An op-amp preamplifier and differentiator
To actuate each string, a PAM8406 Speaker Amplifier IC was
used, paired with a 2Ω 10W power resistor in series with each
string. Many speaker-driving power amplifiers are designed to
drive a load of 4Ω-8Ω as a typical speaker’s voice coil is expected
to be. The PAM8406 IC is one such amplifier, and it is designed
to shut itself off for its own protection when it detects a load
<2Ω. When the (+) and (-) terminals of the chip’s speaker outputs
are connected to each end of a string, an especially conductive
instrument string may appear as a short circuit and put the chip
into shutdown mode. A workaround was identified by placing
a power resistor in series with the conductive string to create a
total resistance >2Ω. Depending on string’s resistance (which is a
function of length, diameter, and material conductivity), resistors
on the order of 0.5Ω-2.0Ω are all reasonable so long as the total
resistance of the string + power resistor is >2Ω.

4.4 Adjustable Magnet Rail
It was identified early in the augmentation that magnet position
was important and being able to adjust the position of each
magnet would be desirable. Therefore, a rail that contains 24
neodymium magnets in 24 parallel slots was designed and laser
cut out of layers of clear acrylic and plywood. Each magnet is
sufficiently close enough to 2 brass strings each to allow actuation
and sustaining to occur (Figure 11). The slots allow for the magnet
positions to be adjusted by sliding a magnet or piece of steel
closely over a given magnet (Figure 12). Though this arrangement
does not maximize the Magnetic Flux B through each string, it
increases the stability of the magnets so they are not trying to
pushing one another away, and this arrangement should ensure
long-term stability of their magnetic strength.

4.5 Optical Key sensing
An array of 48 QRD1114 optical reflectance sensors were installed
beneath the keyboard manual, resting at the end of the key levers.
The sensors work using the same principle as the optical pickup
sensors, though these are arranged to measure the infrared re-
flectance off of a nearby object rather than an object obstructing
its view. As the keys are unpressed, the back of the lever rests very
close to the optical sensor, maximizing reflectance and activating
the optical sensor so that its output voltage is nearly 0𝑉. As a key
is depressed, the back of the lever is further away from the sensor,
reflecting less infrared light back to the sensor and raising the
output voltage of the sensor. The compression/limiter circuitry
that enables dynamic range in the playing of the Sparksichord
anticipates a control voltage range of approximately 0 Volts to
3.3 Volts, where 0V allows no actuation to occur and 3.3V allows
for full actuation. To obtain the desired voltage swing from the
QRD1114 sensors as a key is pressed, the back of each key lever
was first painted black, and then a small dot was carved out of
the black paint approximately where the sensor rests under the
key. The circuit for a single channel can be seen in Figure 13.
This arrangement and sensing method is nearly identical to the
keyboard scanner used in the MRP [ 25] which consists of an
array of QRE1113 Optical Reflectance sensors over the keys of
any piano. The pictured system is permanently installed rather
than removable, and is designed specifically for the spacing of
these keys since harpsichord key widths are not standardized.
The sensor array can be seen in Figure 14.

5 Discussion
5.1 Comparison to other systems
It is difficult to directly compare styles of actuation as they have
different requirements and implications, although we attempt to
describe some pros, cons, and considerations in Table 1.
The Sparksichord closely resembles other electromagnetically-
actuated instruments such as the MRP; both are keyboard instru-
ments with an array of strings use electromagnetic actuation.
However, the design challenges and choices made to create the
Sparksichord and MRP are deeply entangled with their inherent
properties prior to augmentation. For example, the iron frame
and metal bridges of a piano means its steel strings are electrically
connected, and consequently Lorentz Force actuation of a piano
would require significant mechanical overhaul, design, and recon-
figuration to implement. Conversely, the wooden nut and bridge
of the harpsichord means every string is already electrically iso-
lated and more practical for Lorentz Force actuation. Furthermore,
the brass strings of the harpsichord are considerably more elec-
trically conductive than the steel of pianos and therefore offer
greater tuning stability at the electrical current values needed
for actuation and sustain. Although it is not uncommon to see
all-brass harpsichord stringing schedules – particularly in Italian
harpsichords – we had restrung the Zuckermann harpsichord in
all brass. However, after experiencing a few of the higher octave
strings breaking when bringing them up to pitch and a brief
consultation with Zuckermann Harpsichords, we decided to tune
the whole instrument a major third down.
5.2 Analog Circuits, Materials, Feedback, and
Chaotic Behavior
5.2.1 Analog Circuitry.
This project was implemented using exclusively analog circuitry
primarily due to the first author’s background and comfort with
analog design, and secondarily for the potential benefits of analog
design for feedback actuation. To have the best chance at phase-
coherence between the sensing method and actuation method,
there would ideally be no time delay between them. Digital sys-
tems, however, introduce a time delay that will shift the phase
response with respect to frequency due to their inherent process-
ing time. Ultra-low latency processing optimized for audio (as
offered by some microcontrollers or purpose-built FPGAs) may
be used to mitigate this latency and introduce the opportunity for
the flexibility and control of a digital system. Professional-grade
compressors and limiters are designed to minimize undesirable

audio distortion, and parameters such as a limiter or compres-
sor’s attack, release, and ratio are dialed in to mitigate distortions
and non-linearities. However, the limiter circuit implemented is
relatively simple, and we opted to use a fast attack and 100% ratio.
Simulations of our diode-based compression circuit with these
settings reveal that the feedback is subject to harmonic distortion,
but when implemented in a real setting it accomplished the goal
of dynamic control. The choice to remain entirely in the analog
domain afforded a cheap and fast implementation compared to
attempting to work with 48 channels of digital audio, but this
limited our ability to prototype different feedback schemes.
5.2.2 Material-Oriented Interaction and Design.
Discussion surrounding material-oriented interaction [27] has
become commonplace in NIME, and this work is no exception.
Many musicians and practitioners are already intimately familiar
– perhaps explicitly or implicitly – with the properties of an non-
actuated string; the relationship between its length, weight, ten-
sion, etc. to its expected timbral quality and harmonic response
when plucked, struck, or bowed. However, the introduction of
electromagnetic feedback suddenly reveals the string’s otherwise
less-observed properties, such as conductivity or magnetic per-
meability, or unnaturally exaggerated harmonic modes. Due to
the nature of using permanent magnets rather than wired elec-
tromagnetic coils, Lorentz Force actuation invites musicians to
manually handle the magnets, bringing them near strings to ini-
tiate actuation in the same touchless and quasi-magical manner
that has promoted continued fascination with the Theremin. Of-
fering the magnet to different points along the length of a string,
adjusting proximity, or flipping the orientation of the magnet of-
fer especially interesting vantage points to dynamically modulate
the system’s behavior. Depending on the actuation current, fre-
quency, and magnet size, one may even feel the actuation signals
noticeably vibrate the magnet in their grasp11. We also discov-
ered an intriguing mode of interaction while fine-tuning optical
sensor placement, where shifting the optical sensors slightly such
that they enter the nonlinear extremes of their operational range
and encourage the feedback to settle into higher harmonics of the
string, or in some cases creating a rich, droning timbre that peri-
odically swirls between harmonics on the order of seconds. The
response of the feedback can at times be slow, with graceful swells
11We feel obliged to remind readers to practice safety when handling permanent
magnets, as we have personally experienced the occasional finger pinching (not
to mention the numerous frights as unattended, forgotten, or misplaced magnets
enthusiastically and explosively embrace one another and, in some cases, crack,
shatter, or spark
and decays within the harmonic profile. At other times, changes
can be immediate and dramatic, responding to sub-millimeter
changes in sensor placement and drawing parallels to the practice
of no-input mixing (NIM) [28–30].
5.2.3 Leaning away from control, inching towards chaos.
It seems many earlier feedback instruments/devices such as the
Magnetic Resonator Piano [23] and the Moog Guitar [20] share
a common desire to hyper-control feedback by parameterizing
controls. In recent years, however, there has been an influx of
vibrotactile feedback instruments and practitioners that embrace
chaotic, unpredictable behavior, many of whom cite this unpre-
dictability as precisely what makes it so exciting and engaging
[28, 29].
Playing with self-resonating feedback instru-
ments demands that I pay close attention. The
most satisfying feedback music seems to be at
the thresholds and breaking points, and these
are rarely stable. And this is a good thing, be-
cause stability (or equilibrium) actually means
death, where uncertainty, chaos and contingent
connections are the realm of the living.
– Paul Stapleton, in [15]
For many of these practitioners, improvising is particularly
fruitful and perhaps the highlight of their systems [30], and simi-
lar sentiments are shared by those engaging with complex feed-
back in musical instruments [ 11, 14, 26, 38, 39]. Lorentz Force
sustain offers a new vantage point for exploring chaotic feedback,
and informal experiments with Lorentz Force actuation and opti-
cal sensing patched into the feedback path of a no-input mixing
has been promising.
6 Conclusion
This paper has presented the theory behind Lorentz Force ac-
tuation/sustain and has offered practical considerations for im-
plementation within a musical context. After outlining the fun-
damental ingredients needed to build a sustainer or feedback
instrument of this style, we shared technical details of our multi-
channel sustainer harpsichord. We hope this document serves as
a reference, empowering practitioners with a toolkit for design-
ing new musical augmentations and inventions surrounding this
style of string actuation, and we leave readers with reflections
on how Lorentz Force actuation has the potential to lead to new
paradigms of actuated instrument design.

8 Ethical Standards
This stage of the research is focused on technical development
and testing by the authors, so institutional ethics review for hu-
man subjects research has not yet been necessary. Electrical safety
should be considered with any actuated instrument, though the
risks in this setup are low given low power supply voltages and
internal short-circuit protection in the amplifiers. Any future
extensions of this work to historical harpsichords would need
to consider issues of conservation and of the inevitable tensions
between historical and experimental performance practices.
