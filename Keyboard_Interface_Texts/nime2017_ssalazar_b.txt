ABSTRACT
The Fragment String is a new digital musical instrument de-
signed to reinterpret and reect upon the sounds of the in-
struments it is performed in collaboration with. At its core,
it samples an input audio signal and allows the performer
to replay these samples through a granular resynthesizer.
Normally the Fragment String samples an acoustic instru-
ment that accompanies it, but in the absence of this input it
will amplify the ambient environment and electronic noise
of the input audio path to audible levels and sample these.
This ability to leverage both structural, tonal sound and
unstructured noise provide the instrument with multiple di-
mensions of musical expressivity. The relative magnitude of
the physical gestures required to manipulate the instrument
and control the sound also engage an audience in its perfor-
mance. This straightforward yet expressive design has lent
the Fragment String to a variety of performance techniques
and settings. These are explored through case studies in
a ve year history of Fragment String-based compositions
and performances, illustrating the strengths and limitations
of these interactions and their sonic output.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Fragment String (Figure 1) is a new digital musical in-
strument designed to reinterpret and reect upon the sounds
of the instruments it is performed in collaboration with. To
that end, its core is a granular resynthesis engine applied to
sampled live acoustic input. The parameters of the granu-
lar resynthesis are controlled by two strings that are pulled
from the body of the instrument and moved about in space.
In our experience of performing with the instrument, the
resulting interaction is accessible, nuanced, and engaging of

the body, easily understood by beginning performers, while
enabling subtle layers of musical expression for seasoned
practitioners. The relative magnitude of the physical ges-
tures required to manipulate the strings and control the
sound also engage the audience in its performance.
The Fragment String raises interesting questions related
to performative aesthetics of digital music instruments. As
it is fundamentally a sampling instrument, Fragment String
requires additional instrumentation or sound generation mech-
anisms for it to operate in a musical setting. Given a com-
plementary sound source to work with, it is then able to
achieve its own sonic identity derived from its input; with-
out this, it fails to achieve reasonable criteria for an expres-
sive musical instrument.
However, the Fragment String was designed with one ad-
ditional source of input sound: the background noise of its
environment and its own electronic circuits. Using a dynam-
ics processor, the Fragment String amplies these to read-
ily audible levels when no instrumental input is detected,
sampling them for granular playback. While these sonic
materials are generally insuﬃcient to produce an adequate
musical performance on their own, they do aﬀord the instru-
ment a distinctive, whispery \voice" that provides contrast
with instrumental sonic materials.
Together these characteristics have produced an instru-
ment that is straightforward to learn but oﬀers depth in
multiple dimensions of musical expressivity. As such, the
instrument has been used in seven individual musical works
spanning the past ve years, developing a small but mean-
ingful repertoire. Each of these compositions has explored
diﬀerent facets of the instrument's sound-producing capa-
bilities and interactions. These musical works have also
placed the Fragment String in a number of roles: that of
an ensemble instrument, that of a single Fragment String
performer with accompaniment, and that of a performer

playing an acoustic instrument and Fragment String simul-
taneously. Through these compositional and performative
experiences, many of the merits and drawbacks of the Frag-
ment String's design have been made evident.
2. BACKGROUND
The aesthetics and philosophy of instrument building un-
derlying Fragment String are rooted in the principles advo-
cated by and practiced by Dan Trueman, Perry Cook, and
Curtis Bahn. Trueman's BoSSA [ 14] augmented a spherical
array of speakers with sensors mapped to musical synthesis,
fusing into a single object its gestural inputs and its means
of acoustic sound projection. As a digital music instrument,
the BoSSA heralded a return to a more classical acoustic in-
strument paradigm, in which sound directly emanates from
the instrument being performed itself. These ideas were fur-
ther explored in the musical duo \interface," a collaboration
between Trueman and Bahn, the former of whom performed
with BoSSA and the latter of whom projected the sound
of an extensively customized electric bass through a num-
ber of spherical and hemispherical speakers in close prox-
imity [ 1]. Trueman considers the concepts underlying these
eﬀorts and similar work with the Princeton Laptop Orches-
tra [ 11] using two criteria, sonic presenceand performative
attention [12]. Sonic presence concerns itself with how the
sound of an instrument is contextualized acoustically with
a greater electroacoustic ensemble. Performative attention
considers how much eﬀort and attention a digital music in-
strument asks of its performer, how hard or easy is it to
play, and if it can enable the development of \virtuousity."
Ruviaro's denition of a musical instrument complements
these considerations, considering presence, movement and
gesture, and historical context as the dening qualities of a
musical instrument, digital or otherwise [ 10].
The systems described above were necessarily tethered
to external computers to perform the relatively heavy pro-
cessing tasks associated with analyzing sensory input and
synthesizing the resulting audio. More recently, technolog-
ical developments such as the BeagleBoard, Raspberry Pi,
and other single-board computers have allowed the body of
a digital musical instruments to physically encompass the
entirety of gestural input, acoustic output, and the compu-
tational activities associating the two, obviating the need
for a thicket of cables running back to a \real" computer.
The advantages of these systems for digital musical instru-
ment design have been discussed by Berdahl and Ju [ 2, 3]
and Moro et al. [ 7].
The development of Fragment String was directly inspired
by the trend of appropriating game controllers as the basis
for digital musical instrument designs. In particular, a per-
formance of Anne Hege's From the Waters(2012), by the
Princeton Laptop Orchestra, inspired explorations into the
use of the Gametrak golf gaming controller towards musical
ends. In From the Waters, the ensemble members pulled at
and shifted around a single loop of rope tethered to multi-
ple of these controllers in a ritual-like performance. While
many computer music works, intentionally or not, draw at-
tention to the technology underlying them, From the Wa-
ters seemed to use its technical implements to in fact con-
ceal the role of technology in its production, placing in the
foreground the activities of the performers and the musical
results thereof. This quality can be partially attributed to
the work's creative use of the Gametrak controller, which
remains obscure in the eld of computer gaming interfaces
but nonetheless provides interesting and unique gestural op-
portunities for digital musical instrument designers. These
manifold possibilities have been explored and documented
extensively by Freed et al. [ 4], Trueman [ 13], Rotondo et
al. [ 9], Huberth and Nanou [ 6], and Jinshuo Feng in his
Line of voice and string(2016).
The practice of amplifying the acoustic presence of a
space with or without instrumental sound present is well-
established in the history of 20th century music. Alvin
Lucier's I Am Sitting in a Room (1967) is perhaps the
best known example, in which subsequent recordings of
the piece's text are ltered through the titular room, ac-
centuating the its distinctive resonant properties. Gordon
Mumma's Hornpipe (1967) incorporated two small micro-
phones attached at a solo horn player's hip, distanced from
the horn itself; custom electronics would automatically sam-
ple and replay the sound of the horn in space. As stated
by Mumma, the musical results of this process were highly
dependent on the acoustic properties of the space itself [ 8].
3. MOTIV ATION
The Fragment String was borne of several intersecting de-
sires in creating musical instruments for the Stanford Lap-
top Orchestra [ 15]. One of these was to study and introspect
the sounds of the real world on a small scale, and to incor-
porate these activities into a musical piece for a computer
music ensemble. This was further intended to manipulate
live sound in real time, making transparent the nature of
the sound processing and enabling a mechanism for dynamic
musical interplay between acoustic and digital instrumen-
tation.
Another desire that motivated the Fragment String was
to create an instrument that could engage a concert au-
dience more eﬀectively than a wall of laptop screens. As
discussed by Henke [ 5], live computer-generated music, by
default, lacks clarity into the actual processes of its per-
formance. Listeners at a computer-generated music concert
often have no insight into the techniques being employed by
its performers, and perhaps these processes would be overly
abstruse or uninteresting to the audience in any case. While
computer technology has allowed entire virtual symphonies
to be called up with little or no exertion on the part of a
performer, the elusive link between physical presence, ges-
tural action, and musical output has arguably persisted in
computer music performance.
As touched on by Trueman [ 12] and Smallwood [ 11], cre-
ating an instrument for laptop orchestra often involves cre-
ating an entirely new interface for musical expression, com-
posing a work for that new instrument, and teaching its me-
chanics to a group of performers. Composers of works for
laptop orchestra do not have the luxury of performers who
have dedicated multiple decades to their chosen instrument;
in the experience of one of the authors, often an ensemble
will have only practiced with a new digital music instru-
ment for a few weeks before taking to the stage. There-
fore the basic functionality of a digital musical instrument
for laptop orchestra must often be easy to understand and
generally not require an exceptional number of rehearsals
to perform the tasks required by the composition it is in-
tended for. On the other hand, this should not be used as an
excuse to make digital music instruments that lack depth,
nuance, or expressivity that might only be discovered after
some amount of practice. Care is needed to balance a new
instrument's required skill and the musical potential of its
sonic inventory.
The circumstances of composing for laptop orchestra guided
the initial development of the Fragment String, but it soon
become evident that the instrument might be used in smaller
musical groups (Section 5 discusses these eﬀorts).
382
4. INSTRUMENT DESIGN
The basic design of Fragment String is two strings drawn
from a box that is typically seated on the ground at the
feet of the performer. An input source, typically an acous-
tic instrument sampled through a microphone or pickup, is
recorded by the Fragment String continuously. Each string
records this input into its own separate buﬀer of audio. Up
to ten seconds of continuous audio is recorded; beyond this,
samples will be overwritten starting with the earliest. The
instrument eﬀectively samples up to the most recent ten
seconds of input.
Drawing a string upwards and pulling it out of the instru-
ment's housing will cause the corresponding buﬀer to stop
recording and enter playback mode. In this mode, the string
plays back the current contents of its buﬀer, at a gain ex-
ponentially proportional to the length of string drawn. The
buﬀer does not automatically advance its position in the
recorded sound; instead, it freezes the current position in
place and replays a cluster of fragments around the play-
head. The string can also be moved forward away from the
performer or backwards toward the performer to respec-
tively advance or move back the playback buﬀer position.
At all times the performer is in control of the buﬀer posi-
tion; the instrument simply plays back a cloud of fragments
surrounding the current position. Moving the string left or
right adjusts the playback rate of the individual fragments,
granting pitch control of the sample.
Figure 2: Diagram of operation of a single string.
Returning the string to the fully withdrawn position will
stop playback and resume recording for the corresponding
buﬀer. The previous contents of the buﬀer are entirely
cleared and a new buﬀer of sampled audio up to ten seconds
in length is accumulated. The two strings are independent
of each other; in addition to recording and playing separate
buﬀers, one can record while the other plays, or vice versa,
or both can record or both play, according to the musical
intent of the performer and/or composer. As summarized in
Figure 2, moving the string up and down activates playback
and controls gain, forward and backward controls the cur-
rent playback position with the sample, and left and right
adjusts pitch.
The audio input of the Fragment String is processed with
extreme dynamic range compression, such that if no in-
strumental input has been received recently the low-volume
noise of the input signal is amplied to audible levels. This
captures both electrical noise from the analog signal path
and the ambient sound of the space, captured through the
instrument microphone or pickup. If one string is playing
while another is recording, and no instrumental input is
present, the instrument will eﬀectively sample itself ltered
through the reverberant characteristics of the performance
space.
This design has led to an instrument fundamentally about
exploring and probing the sounds of individual instruments
in addition to the intricate and often-ignored sounds of
space and electronic noise. Fragment String gives its per-
former direct control over the recreation of samples of these
sounds, with the goal of directing these explorations towards
musical ends.
4.1 Performance Techniques
This instrumental design has led to a number of standard
techniques for performing with the Fragment String. By ad-
vancing the string forward at a suitable rate, the performer
is able to play back the sample similar to how it sounded
originally. The string can be held in one place to maintain
a constant drone, eﬀective when used in tandem with the
acoustic instrument playing oﬀ of the drone. In this gesture,
the string can be slowly raised and lowered to vary the dy-
namics over time, and can also be pulled out to the left or
right to adjust the pitch and register of the drone if that
is musically desirable, up to an octave lower or higher than
the original sample. As mentioned previously, the ambient
environmental sound and line noise of the system can be
sampled and replayed at readily audible volumes, creating a
texture that contrasts with the tonal, acoustic instrumenta-
tion rather than reinforcing it. By alternating the left and
right strings between recording and playing, the sampled
sound can be \traded" back and forth between the buﬀers,
ltering it each time through the speaker, the acoustic en-
vironment of the performance space, and the microphone
input. This last technique can be used with either instru-
mental samples or ambient noise samples.
4.2 Technical Implementation
At the technical core of the Fragment String instrument
is a software program that samples from an audio input
device and regranularizes the sample in response to user
control. This program is implemented in the ChucK audio
programming language [ 16]. The Fragment String software
is functionally agnostic to what its actual audio source ac-
tually is, be it a built-in laptop microphone, line input, or
full outboard audio interface with professional microphone.
Various iterations of the Fragment String have employed all
of these.
The standard \rst-edition" Fragment String consists of a
laptop computer running the core software, a Shure SM57
microphone connected to an audio interface providing audio
input, and either stereo output to the house sound system or
six-channel output to a hemispherical speaker. Variations of
this arrangement were used in the bulk of the performances
described in Section 5.
More recently, a\second-edition"Fragment String was de-
veloped to unite its modular parts both physically and con-
ceptually (Figure 1). For this, an enclosure was developed
to house the Gametrak controller, a Raspberry Pi single-
board computer to run the software and mediate the various
hardware components, a USB audio ADC with built-in mi-
crophone preamp, an Arduino to process input and output
gain knobs, and an audio daughterboard for stereo audio
output. This rstly resolved the practical issue of needing
to plug in some form of all of these components when set-
ting up for a performance and needing to disconnect and
transport all of these when breaking down afterwards. It
secondly resolved the aesthetic issue of the instrument be-
ing divided into disparate, loosely connected parts; bringing
these together into a single box in a sense\promotes"it from
an ad-hoc assembly of hardware and software to a musical
instrument that might be reasoned about as such.

5. PERFORMANCE AND COMPOSITION
Since the instrument's inception in 2012, a number of works
for ensemble, duo, and trio incorporating the Fragment
String have been composed and performed. Initially, the
Fragment String was intended as an instrument to be used
by multiple performers in an ensemble, but it has since
proven to work well in smaller-scale settings for two or
three performers. Through these various manifestations of
the Fragment String in performance and composition, the
instrument has developed a broad palette of musical tech-
niques, motives, and eﬀects.
5.1 Muted Voices(2012)
The rst composition to use the Fragment String was Muted
Voices for solo violin and Fragment String ensemble (Fig-
ure 3). Muted Voices comprises a solo violinist and nine
to eleven laptop performers with Fragment Strings. Each
Fragment String samples an audio signal from the violin,
mediated by a single pickup or microphone whose signal is
distributed to the computer instruments. These sounds are
replayed over individual six-channel hemispherical speakers
situated alongside each Fragment String.
The performers are split into inner and outer groups, the
former consisting of three or four performers and the latter
comprising the remaining ensemble members. These groups
are spatially arranged with the soloist such that the solo per-
former is in the center of the stage, the inner group is closest
to the soloist, and the outer group is further out surround-
ing the inner group. A conductor leads these performers
continuously throughout the piece using a set of invented
gestures indicating various performance techniques of the
Fragment String. The conductor is also responsible for en-
suring the ensemble performers and soloist are in sync.
Compositionally, Muted Voicesconsists of eleven stanzas,
each mostly under a minute in duration and each provok-
ing the solo violinist and ensemble performers to interact in
varying ways. These stanzas are arranged to support the
piece's overall musical progression through ebbs and ows
of sonic textures. The opening stanza of the piece utilizes
one of the basic techniques of the Fragment String, gently
replicating the violin's opening statement among only the
inner group of performers. The next stanza brings in the
entire ensemble of performers to repeat the violin's passage,
and then the inner group brings in samples of the non-
instrumental sound, ltering the original sample through
the Fragment String, through the space, and through the
Fragment String again in a sort of musical game of \tele-
phone." These sorts of interactions are further explored in
successive stanzas; near the piece's midpoint, the groups of
Fragment String players perform several exchanges of sam-
plings of the space without the solo violin, recursively l-
tering the ambient sound of the hall and the constituent
electronic systems' own internal noise.
Overall, the work fullled its composer's goals of balanc-
ing both acoustic and electronic elements in a spatialized,
musically meaningful interplay. A casual survey of audi-
ence reaction after the performance suggested some level of
engagement with the piece both aurally and visually. Fur-
thermore, the overall sonic textures created in the work were
able to be varied to a satisfactory degree, suggesting possi-
bilities for additional works using the instrument.
5.2 Fragment String(2012)
The eponymous work involving Fragment String was its de-
but as an instrument for a single performer within a duet,
in this case with piano. The composition was again divided
into eleven stanzas, each exploring diﬀerent types of inter-
play between the piano and Fragment String. Stanzas that
heavily leaned on sampling the piano were puncuated at
certain points with a stanza that exclusively sampled the
ambient space, complemented with droplets of piano g-
ures, dividing the overall structure of the piece into three
sections. These developed into a climax just after the piece's
midpoint, in which the piano and Fragment String reached
their greatest point of intensity, with the Fragment String
being diﬀused across an 8-channel spatialization. (This is
the only work thus far that has spatialized the Fragment
String beyond two audio channels.)
5.3 Side Two(2012)
Side Two was a trio for digitally-processed guitar, laptop
performer, and Fragment String, developed as an unstruc-
tured improvisation. The Fragment String's input was a
mix of the guitar and a revolving sequence of unparticular
patches run on the laptop, and its ability to re-render and
dissect these jumbled, arbitrary sources was limited. It is
diﬃcult to view the Fragment String's role as a success in
this work.
5.4 Telematic Improvisation(2014)
Telematic Improvisationwas developed as a networked piece
between a digital cello (\celletto") player in Stanford, Cali-
fornia, and a pipa player and computer-based performers
in Beijing, China. One digital performer used her cus-
tom \wheeletto" digital musical instrument, while six other
performers were equipped with the Fragment String. The
pipa was miked and connected to each Fragment String in-
put, providing a backdrop for interlinking improvisations
between pipa, wheeletto, and celletto.
384
Figure 4: Search for Life(2014).
5.5 Search for Life(2014)
Search for Lifeis a work for found objects and laptop en-
semble (Figure 4). Two of the piece's performers construct a
percussive soundscape using found objects from the streets
and markets of Beijing, China, where the work was devel-
oped and premiered. These sounds are further manipulated
by passive digital processing as well as six Fragment String
performers, who operate the instrument with chopsticks at-
tached to the end of each string. The Fragment String setup
for each performer uses the built-in laptop microphone of its
host laptop as well as an individual six-channel hemispher-
ical speaker for sound emission, giving a localized acoustic
identity to both the input and output of the instrument.
Here, the Fragment String provides a steady, unsettling
backdrop to contrast with the staccato sounds of the found
objects. Initially, a toy that spins a short, thin tube through
the air, generating a whirring sound, is sampled by the Frag-
ment Strings, prolonging the whirr and distributing it across
the space. Later on, the Fragment Strings sample the more
percussive, transient sounds of the performers, abstracting
them from their mundane familiarity by examining their
constituent parts.
The physical aspect of Fragment String was used to pro-
nounced eﬀect in Search for Life. After the whirring toy is
sounded and carried around the space for several seconds,
the Fragment String performers in unison shoot upwards,
raising their arms to bring the strings to their maximum
length and thus maximum volume. Similar gestural eﬀects
are employed throughout the piece, making evident the link
between movement and sound.
5.6 Improvisation for Trumpet and Fragment
String (2016)
Improvisation for Trumpet and Fragment Stringis an im-
provisitory duet between trumpet and Fragment String (Fig-
ure 5). It does not have a predened structure or form,
instead relying on dynamic listening and response on the
part of both performers. In a performance of the piece in
November 2016, the trumpeter put down the instrument
to play via mobile phone \The Diﬀerence Between Hear-
ing and Listening," 1 a lecture by Pauline Oliveros, who had
passed away a week prior; the audio of this recording was
fed into the input of Fragment String. Overall, the piece
has lent itself towards further introspection into the nature
of improvisatory performance involving Fragment String.
In an acoustic chamber ensemble, the musicians will often
breathe and move together, taking visual as well as aural
cues as a means of anticipating and responding to one an-
other. Although a digital musical instrument, the gestures
1https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QHfOuRrJB8
inherent to Fragment String very closely mimic those of
acoustic instruments, making it an engaging and satisfying
instrument for electroacoustic collaboration.
When at rest, Fragment String is in a listening state.
Much like an acoustic instrument, it produces no output
until it is physically interacted with by the performer. Fur-
thermore, it requires continuous physical input from the
performer in order to produce continuous sound. Unlike
some digital instruments that function autonomously after
being activated by the performer, every sound produced by
Fragment String is the direct result of a physical gesture.
Additionally, in order to transition to new source material,
at least one of the strings must momentarily return to its
neutral \listening" state. This momentary reset is reminis-
cent of, for instance, a wind player taking a breath or a
string player changing bow direction.
These acoustic instrument-like properties contrast with
many electronic instruments that function by constantly
producing sound, requiring a performer to carve out silence
or actively stop the sound. Instead, in Fragment String
as with acoustic instruments, physical gesture equals sound
activation. From the perspective of the acoustic instrumen-
talist, this results in a natural improvisation experience; it
is very easy to read the body and gestures of the Fragment
String player to understand where they are going with a
musical thought. This is also facilitated by the association
of larger gestures with larger sounds and vice versa, a facet
often overlooked in electronic music performance.
Fragment String is capable of outputting a range of sounds
and gestures broad enough as to not limit the acoustic per-
former (by boxing them into a particular tonal center, for
example). Furthermore, the ability of Fragment String to
sample extra-musical room sounds and \silence" freed the
trumpet player from feeling the need to drive the piece by
constantly playing, or from feeling responsible for seeding
new input material in order to provide musical development
or variation.
5.7 Meeting (2016)
Meeting is an improvisatory piece for two multi-instrumentalists,
one playing trumpet and Fragment String, and the other
playing piano and auxiliary percussion. The piece is a slowly
unfolding exploration of texture and density, making use of
extended techniques and extreme dynamic range. The mi-
crophone capturing input for Fragment String is placed at
a fair distance from the performers, with the goal of us-

String (2016).

ing the entire room as sampling input. This resulted in an
output from Fragment String that was considerably more
obfuscated than normal, in which the instruments and en-
vironmental sounds blended together to form a cloud-like
wash of texture. Furthermore, this is the rst and only
work in which a performer simultaneously performed with
Fragment String and another instrument.
During the performance, the trumpet player is seated
with Fragment String positioned on the oor next to them,
allowing them to interact with the strings with their left
hand while holding the trumpet in their right. While per-
haps not the most eﬃcient means of playing the trumpet for
prolonged periods of time, it is common practice to period-
ically remove one hand from the instrument in order to use
mutes or turn pages, so this was a fairly natural interaction
to adopt.
The main limitation of this setup is that it is diﬃcult to
take advantage of the independent control of the strings,
with only one hand available to interact with them. That
being said, once the strings were in the players left hand,
it was possible to loop them through the 3rd valve ring (or
simply thread them between ngers of the left hand) and
return to a natural trumpet playing position with typical
range of motion. Once engaged, even subtle movements
inherent to playing the trumpet (both side to side and ver-
tically) would pull on the strings, resulting in slight changes
to Fragment Strings output.
Following the performance of this piece, a number of au-
dience members reported enjoying the physical gestures re-
quired in order to play Fragment String. Given the results
of the performance, the Fragment String oﬀers interesting
possibilities for use by a single performer with an acoustic
instrument.
6. CONCLUSIONS
The Fragment String is a new digital musical instrument
that samples its input and allows a performer to replay
these samples using transparent, organic gestural control.
Its ability to sample both instrumental sounds and the am-
bient noise of its electronics and environs aﬀord it a breadth
of musical expressivity. The directness and magnitude of its
control interface enable it to be easily understood by begin-
ning performers and by audiences, while allowing a depth of
technique and practice to be developed with the instrument
over time. These elements have been explored over a vari-
ety of works for ensemble, trio, and duo, revealing through
practice the advantages, caveats, shortcomings, and future
possibilities of the instrument.
