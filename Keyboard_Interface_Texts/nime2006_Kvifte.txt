ABSTRACT
This paper discusses the need for a framework for describ-
ing musical instruments and their design, and discusses
some possible elements in such a framework. The frame-
work is meant as an aid in the development of a coher-
ent terminology for describing, comparing and discussing
diﬀerent musical instruments and musical instrument de-
signs. Three diﬀerent perspectives are presented; that of
the listener, the performer, and the constructor, and vari-
ous levels of descriptions are introduced.
Keywords
Musical instrument design, mapping, gestures, organology.
1. INTRODUCTION
In the literature on musical instruments and musical in-
strument construction, one central theme is the relation or
mapping between gestures1 used to control an instrument
and the resultant sounds. In later years, an increasing
number of papers describe aspects of such gesture-sound
relationships, many of them basing the discussion on spe-
ciﬁc examples of newly constructed controllers and/or in-
struments. In many cases, however, these discussions do
not address more general principles, and even if the in-
struments described are interesting, the discussions do not
necessarily add to a broader understanding of musical in-
strument construction. Part of the problem is a lack of
consensus on terminology, and this paper is an attempt
to start a discussion of necessary, fruitful and convenient
terminology in the study of musical instrument descrip-
tion and construction. Through this, we advocate a ﬁeld
of study which might be calledtheoretical organology.
The construction of new instruments and mappings raises
a number of considerations. One set concerns the listener:
What kind(s) of sounds do we expect when we see a cer-
tain gesture? What kind(s) of gestures do we imagine
when we hear certain sounds. Another set concerns the
performer: What are intuitive and natural mappings in
1”Gesture” is here deﬁned as body gestures, i.e. physical
movement.

the instrument? What are exciting mappings that stimu-
late creativity?
This is not to say that new mappings should always fol-
low such expectations, but a better knowledge of gesture-
sound relationships would certainly help in both making
mappings that both conform to, and possibly also violate,
our expectations. In both cases a set of conceptual tools
are needed; and to be able to draw on the great number of
studies that have been, and will be, published, we need to
start discussing to coordinate the terminology being used.
2. THREE PERSPECTIVES
There is of course a close connection between overall
perspective and terminology. We have already mentioned
two diﬀerent perspectives, that of the performer and that
of the listener. A third is that of the instrument construc-
tor. The following sections will present three models of
an overall performer-instrument system corresponding to
these three perspectives; and how they can be described.
2.1 The listener
Seen from a listener’s perspective, it is important to
be able to characterize the general relationship between
gestures and the emerging sound (Figure 1).
Gesture Musical sound
Figure 1: Gesture - Sound
The musical sound may also invoke some kind of listener
activity, for example dancing, foot tapping or applause.
Figure 2 presents this distinction of Gesture P(erformer)
and L(istener).

Figure 2: Musical sound also evoking new gestures
The gestural activity of the audience may in turn inﬂu-
ence the musicians and their gestures; and we will have a
closed loop of information ﬂow (Figure 3).

In this paper, where we focus on the description and
construction of musical instruments rather than the in-
terplay between musicians and audience, this larger loop
is not in the center of attention. We will rather concen-
trate on how the listener perceives the interplay between
the musician, the instrument, and the resulting sound, as
seen from a smaller or greater distance. We want to char-
acterize how the actual connection between gestures and
musical sound, i.e. themapping, is perceived (Figure 4).

Mapping
Figure 4: Model of the listeners perspective
Seen from a distance, smaller details of ﬁnger move-
ments will probably not be as important as larger bodily
movements, and one may not be able to distinguish easily
between sound-producing gestures and other movements.
Purely expressive and/or optional gestures may neverthe-
less be experienced as relevant to the sound by the audi-
ence, and it is not obvious where to draw the analytical
line. As Wanderley et. al observe: “[...] clarinetists’ ancil-
lary gestures are not randomly produced or just a visual
eﬀect, but rather they are an integral part of the perfor-
mance process.” [10, 98]
To account for this, descriptions of the mapping between
gesture and sound at this level might therefore include
several levels of resolution.
2.2 The performer
In a model of the performer’s perspective, we add a de-
vice and include the feedback. The performing subject is
only implicitely represented in the ﬁgure, as the agent per-
forming the Gesture, and receiving the Feedback (Figure
5).

Figure 5: A ﬁrst approximation of a model of the
performer’s perspective
Several models building on this basic scheme have been
proposed. One rather abstract model is found in [7], and
includes just the performer’s perceptions and intentions
about the playing on the one hand, and what is called the
instrument control on the other (Figure 6). Implied in the
model is that the feedback from the instrument control to
the performer is in terms of sound, understood as music.
This model is focused primarily on the performer, to the
extent that the instrument as such is not present; only the
parts of the instrument that are sensitive to control. These
are calledcontrol organsin this model, and we will use this
term to denote instrument parts like keyboards, buttons,
ﬁnger-holes etc., as well as sensors of various kinds that
are put to use for controlling sound-producing hard- and
software.

Choi’s model (Figure 7) is a bit more detailed, as the
instrument here also includes the sound-producing parts,
and the instrument control, here calledinterface, is exem-
pliﬁed to a certain extent. Note that both these models
only present auditory feedback; none of them take haptic
or tactile feedback into account.

sical instrument. After [2]
An even more abstract model is found in [5], as shown in
Figure 8. In this model, performer actions and input de-
vices correspond to the control actions and control organs
in Figure 6. Here, the sound producing device is included,
but the performer and feedback loops are not shown. This
model highlights the mappings between performer actions
and the sound producing device as a possibly rather com-
plex system of connections.
A more comprehensive model should include the map-

pings ”gesture – control organ” and ”control organ – sound”,
but in the musical information ﬂow, the inner workings of
the sound module is not of interest to the performer, so
that part is reserved for the constructors perspective.
We also ﬁnd it important to explicitly show the feedback
from the diﬀerent parts of the system. The performer may
receive and use feedback from his own gestures, from the
contact with the control organs of the instrument, as well
as from the actual sound produced (as illustrated in Figure
9). Sometimes the feedback is essential — it is literally
impossible to play a theremin without hearing the sound
and pitches produced. In other cases feedback may be
helpful, but not essential, like the visual feedback from a
piano style keyboard, as is illustrated by e.g. professional,
blind pianists.
2.3 The Constructor
The constructor needs a far more detailed view of the
system than the listener and performer presented in the
previous sections. There are several models in the litera-
ture, each focusing on diﬀerent aspects. A relatively com-
prehensive model might look like the one in Figure 10.
This model suggests that the mappings may be viewed
as chained: the output of one mapping is the input to the
next. Also, the phenomena to be described are quite di-
verse; from space-time trajectories (gestures), to interface
layout, to sound synthesis descriptors, to descriptions of
sound as music.
This model is quite similar to the one found in [1], where
the interesting concept of ‘related–to–perception’ parame-
ters is introduced, (Figure 11), but slightly more explicit in
the number of descriptions and mappings. Unlike Arﬁb’s,
however, the model in Figure 10 does not say anything
about actual parameters to form the descriptions, or about
the mappings between them.
2.4 Technical vs. musical construction, or
the role of information and energy
In models of the kinds shown here, we will ﬁnd accounts
of both information ﬂow and ﬂow of physical energy, and
it is not necessarily obvious whether Figure 10 refers to
information or energy, or both.
One reason for this, is that the concept of ‘energy’ is
used in many diﬀerent ways, both as a concept of physics,
but also to describe perceived qualities of music, like when
we talk about ‘energetic playing’, ‘forceful sounds’ etc.
On closer inspection, it is obvious that the upward ﬂow
in the ﬁgure refers to information exclusively, and not to
physical energy, as the only entities ﬂowing arefeedback
descriptions. This is not to say that physical energy is
not involved in the process, but only to point out that
what we are interested in, also concerning energy, is the
information conveyed.
Striking a piano key requires a performer’s energy, and
this energy is musically relevant since it determines the
force with which the hammer strikes a string, which in
turn determines the energy of the sound produced, which
in turn determines the energy reaching the ears of the per-
former and listener. This energy, however, is not the same
as perceived loudness, when loudness is seen as a musical
parameter. While the physical energy level decreases with
the square of the distance from the sound source, the per-
ceived musical loudness may be almost invariant over quite
a distance from the sound source. For the performer, the
actual energy used is less interesting than the diﬀerence
in energy needed to produce a diﬀerence in a perceived
musical parameter.
In general, as far as Figure 10 is seen as a model of
music-making, one should only be concerned with infor-
mation. The musical construction of an instrument is a
matter of information processing. However, for the con-
structor, a piano key must be made so that diﬀerences in
output levels, corresponding to musically meaningful dif-
ferences, are physically feasible for the performer. And
the chain of energy that carries the information around
the circuit must be geared to the equipment used at the
diﬀerent stages.
Such considerations may be kept separate from the mu-
sical construction of the system, and we believe the musical
construction will become clearer if this separation is made.
3. PARAMETERS
3.1 Parameter types
The parameters involved in the description of a musi-
cal instrument may be organized in the following general
types:
 Gestural parameters
 Technical parameters
Proceedings of the 2006 International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME06), Paris, France
222
 
Figure 11: Mapping chain after [1]
 Musical parameters
Typically, the input parameters of the whole system will
belong to the ﬁrst type, while the output will, as argued
above, best be described in terms of musical information.
The diﬀerent types of parameters must be described in
diﬀerent ways, and the challenge is to ﬁnd ways to con-
nect the descriptions to ﬁnd common or corresponding
properties in the diﬀerent kinds of description.
3.2 Parameter description
In this section, we will concentrate on properties that
are valid across diﬀerent kinds of parameters and their de-
scription in detail. This concerns level of speciﬁcity, the
distinction discrete/continuous, and the concept of mea-
surement levels. These are all considerations that may
be helpful when looking for how properties of parameters
at one point are reﬂected in properties of parameters at
another point in the chain.
3.2.1 Levels of speciﬁcity
It is obvious that there is a need for descriptions on
diﬀerent levels, or with various degrees of detail. The ges-
tures used by performers might be best described in rather
broad terms in the perspective of the listener, while one
will need a far greater amount of detail when describing
them from the performers perspective and the constructor
may need even more detail.
3.2.2 Musical parameters
One of the real challenges, is to deﬁne relevant descrip-
tions of musical output. At a very general level, the param-
eterspitch, loudness, timbre and duration may be used.
As soon as one wants more speciﬁc descriptions, however,
there is a large number of possible descriptions, and mean-
ingful descriptions are very much depending on musical
style, as well as on experience with the instrument in ques-
tion.
The descriptions needed, develop with experience, and
with development of new instruments. From the very start
of synthesizer construction, a large number of new param-
eters, especially for timbre, became available for explo-
ration and incorporation in musical practice through new
user interfaces. More recently, a similar development con-
cerning musical manipulation of time in various software
packages, widens our musically relevant parameters in the
ﬁeld of rhythm, tempo and time.
In this context, we will touch upon only the most general
level.
3.2.3 Levels of measurement
One way to characterize parameters in a general way, is
through the concept of levels of measurement [4]:
 Nominal level: Values may only be distinguished
from each other, and not ordered.
 Ordinal level: Values may also be ordered in a se-
quence.
 Interval level: Values may be ordered, and there is a
way to measure distance between values.
 Ratio level: Values may be ordered; distances mea-
sured, and there exists an absolute zero value, so that
division and multiplication of values are meaningful
operations.
At a general level, these four levels may be associated
with the four general musical parameters in the following
way:
 Nominal level: Timbre. There is no generally ac-
cepted way to characterize and organize timbre, but
it is still possible to diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent
instruments, and it is possible to construct scales for
aspectsof timbre (e.g. brightness).
 Ordinal level: Loudness. It is obvious how to order
loudness levels, but not necessarily how to describe
preciseintervals of loudness.
 Interval level: Pitch. Musical pitches are ordered
into classes with perceptually meaningful compara-
ble distances, like half tone, whole tone etc. But
there is no meaningful zero point.
 Ratio level: Durations may be ordered and mea-
sured, and there is an obvious zero (no duration),
and ratios are meaningful — a half note is half the
duration of a whole note.
The implication for the control of musical instruments
is that an input parameter has to be on at least as high a
level of measurement as the output parameter it is meant
to control. But there is not always a need for controlling an
output variable at the maximum level, as will be explained
in more detail below.

3.2.4 Discrete vs. continuous parameters
The perception of the four general musical parameters
may be described as having two diﬀerent dimensions, dis-
crete and continuous. The discrete dimension is tied to
categorization or sets of concepts; the continuous to grad-
ual variations. Pitch may be perceived both as belonging
to discrete pitch-classes (c, d etc),and as a continuous
entity as in vibrato and glissandi. Similar considerations
may be done for the three other general parameters (See
e.g. [3] and [7]).
There are several implications of this for the connection
between input (gestural) parameters and output (musi-
cal) parameters (Figure 12). First of all, a continuous
output parameter needs a continuous input control to be
controlled in detail. But it is also possible to use a discrete
input totrigger a preprogrammed continuous variation of
output like a vibrato on an synthesizer. On the other hand,
a discrete output may be controlled by a discrete input,
like pitch classes controlled by a keyboard, but there are
also numerous examples of a continuous controller control-
ling a discrete output parameter, like a trombone slide con-
trolling discrete pitch classes (as well as continuous pitch
variations).

Figure 12: Combinations of discrete and continu-ous input and output
The various combinations of discrete and continuous
variations for input and output for diﬀerent musical pa-
rameters give diﬀerent demands and possibilities for the
performer. This is generally acknowledged by performance
teachers and students, even though we have little general
knowledge on the eﬀects of diﬀerent combinations.
3.3 The description of mappings
3.3.1 The mapping chain
In the three perspectives discussed above, the mapping
chain was described in increasing detail; with only one
mapping from gesture to sound in the listeners perspective,
to a chain of ﬁve diﬀerent mappings in the constructors
perspective.
All the mappings in the last chain will at some point
have to be described during the construction of an instru-
ment, but they will in a sense be subordinate to the overall
gesture–sound mapping, that might be called thedeﬁning
mapping for the instrument. It is this overall gesture–
sound mapping which deﬁnes the identity of an instru-
ment, and this is what we will focus on in the following
sections.
3.3.2 Basic mapping strategies
There are three basic approaches to the actual mapping.
The traditional way is to describe and construct a ﬁxed
or static mapping, where the relations between input and
output parameters stay the same. Traditional acoustic
instruments are usually well suited to such descriptions.
Another possibility is a variable mapping, where map-
pings may be changed by the performer. Most commercial
synthesizers are good examples of this approach.
Finally, mappings may be the outcome of a dynamic
(learning) process where the performer can choose the ges-
tures, or the mapping is modiﬁed by the actual behaviour
of the performer (e.g. [1] and [9]).
All three cases need a common way of describing map-
pings.
3.3.3 A general mapping description problem
Several authors mention that mappings may take dif-
ferent forms with regard to how many input parameters
are controlling how many output parameters. In [7], the
term ‘coupling’ is used, diﬀerentiating between ‘control
couplings’ and ‘sound variable couplings’, corresponding
to the many-to-one and one-to-many examples in Figure
13 respectively (see also [1] and [5]).

Figure 13: Examples of many-to-one and one-to-
many mappings of input to output.
While there are a number of high-level characterizations
available, there is a need for a more detailed typology of
mappings. Traditional acoustical instruments may be a
good starting point, because they represent a quite di-
verse set of possibilities that are well known through long
practice.
One way is to make general overviews of mappings for a
number of instruments, where control actions are mapped
to the generalized musical parameters as described above.
In [7], this is done for 23 instruments, and a few general
points are made (one example in Figure 14).
With such overviews, it might be possible to create ‘ges-
tural ensembles’ based on the gestures used to control
an instrument. ‘Bowing’, ‘string-stopping’, ‘ﬁnger-hole-
ﬁngering’, ‘piano-type-keyboarding’, ‘concertina-buttoning’
etc. might be examples of such ensembles. Such entities
will represent a speciﬁcation of the control of single in-
struments, and at the same time be useful over a range
of instruments; possibly useful also as a basis for a more
general typology of gesture–sound mappings in musical in-
struments.
Also relevant to such a typology, is the more detailed
model found in [8], where an analysis of how a single mu-
sical tone — a musicalevent — is controlled, is used to
develop terminology for the description of what is called
‘musical control space’. Here, a musical event is broken

down into ﬁve phases, calledSelective preconditioning, Be-

gories introduced for each phase.
All these approaches, however, raise a general problem.
While input parameters may be relatively well-deﬁned ges-
tures, the same is not the case with output parameters.
As discussed in section (3.2.2), meaningful descriptions of
musical output in more detail depends heavily on musical
style and experience with the musical instrument being
discussed.
This means that development of a more general map-
ping theory should be closely connected to development
inmusic theory. Without some kind of consensus on rel-
evant musical entities, what they are, and how they are
related, no coherent theory of mappings is possible.
4. CONCLUSIONS
As is obvious from the brief literary overview in this pa-
per, there is no general agreement on terms for describing
musical instrument design and mapping. This holds on
almost every level of description, and almost every aspect
of the models presented here. We believe that a com-
mon set of descriptors could be valuable for both analysts
and constructors in the ﬁeld, and may also help to unify
various models being proposed, as well as clarifying real
diﬀerences of opinion.
This paper has not addressed questions of how gestures
can be formalized. This is discussed further in in [6].
