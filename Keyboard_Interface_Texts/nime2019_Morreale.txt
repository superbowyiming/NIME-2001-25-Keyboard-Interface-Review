ABSTRACT
This paper introduces the Magpick, an augmented pick for
electric guitar that uses electromagnetic induction to sense
the motion of the pick with respect to the permanent mag-
nets in the guitar pickup. The Magpick provides the gui-
tarist with nuanced control of the sound that coexists with
traditional plucking-hand technique. The paper presents
three ways that the signal from the pick can modulate the
guitar sound, followed by a case study of its use in which
11 guitarists tested the Magpick for ﬁve days and composed
a piece with it. Reﬂecting on their comments and experi-
ences, we outline the innovative features of this technology
from the point of view of performance practice. In partic-
ular, compared to other augmentations, the high tempo-
ral resolution, low latency, and large dynamic range of the
Magpick support a highly nuanced control over the sound.
Our discussion highlights the utility of having the locus of
augmentation coincide with the locus of interaction.

1. INTRODUCTION
In virtually all musical instruments, the set of gestural fea-
tures that contribute to the production of sound is bounded
by the physical constraints of actuation. In the case of the
guitar, even if we were to consider the movements of the pick
solely, only those involving an interaction with the strings
(e.g. plucking and releasing the string, sliding on the string)
actually have an eﬀect on the sound [23]. Many other nat-
urally occurring gestures, the so called ancxillary gestures,
could potentially be used to control sound production [6,
23]. For instance, continuing with the example of the gui-
tar, the movements of the pick pre- and post-pluck and the
movements of the pick above the strings could be used as
performance material.

Figure 1: The Magpick is composed of two parts: a
hollow body (black) and a cap (brass).
The challenge is to ﬁnd ways to sense the movement of
the pick with respect to the guitar with high resolution,
high dynamic range, and low latency, then use the resulting
signal in a way that is compatible with existing guitar tech-
nique. Ideally, the pick should also be minimally invasive
and should not require additional hardware to be installed
on the guitar.
The Magpick (Figure 1) is an augmented guitar pick (plec-
trum) that consists of a hollowed custom-designed pick with
several loops of wire embedded within it. When the pick
moves within an ambient magnetic ﬁeld, such as that cre-
ated by the permanent magnets in an electric guitar pickup,
an electromotive force (voltage) is induced in the coil, which
is proportional to the rate of change in magnetic ﬂux. In
the context of guitar playing, this signal is related to the
speed of movement, the angle of the pick with respect to
the guitar body, and the proximity of the pick to the pick-
ups. As a consequence, the voltage generated in the wire
embedded in the pick de facto provides information about
the gestures of the plucking hand.
The wire is connected to a small preampliﬁer embedded
in a box that can be worn on the wrist. The output of
the preampliﬁer is connected to a Bela audio processor [10],
where it is combined with the signal from the guitar to
produce a new output signal that modiﬁes or extends the
sound of the guitar. This solution accurately responds to
the speed, location, and intensity of the pick movements
in the pickup area with a wide dynamic range. Especially
important is the fact that the signal in the pick is also gen-
erated by motion above the strings (not touching them) as
well as by strums and plucks.
In the next section we present existing attempts to aug-
ment guitars and guitar picks, then in Section 3 we detail
the technological implementation of the Magpick. In Sec-
tion 4 we present a user study with 11 guitarists, who used
the Magpick over a period of 5 days. The ﬁndings and impli-
cations are discussed in Section 5, and Section 6 summarises
the contributions of this paper and presents possible future
directions.

2. RELATED WORK
The Magpick is situated within an approach to digital in-
strument design where a focus on subtlety, nuance, or con-
trol intimacy [24] takes priority over the navigation of high-
dimensional parameter spaces. Tanaka [18] observed of the
subtlety of acoustic instruments that “the clarity of interac-
tion then goes beyond the simple question of parameter and
event mapping of ‘what controls what’ to a more high-level
analysis of how diﬀerent gestural inputs are used to derive
the diﬀerent types of articulative signals.” A recent trend
has been the development of instruments with continuous
audio-rate sampling of relatively few control signals (often
only one) [22, 12, 17], from which a rich gestural language
can translate into the articulation of complex signals whose
musical output is readily grasped in an enactive way [24]
even if the digital system makes no attempt to segment or
classify the gestures producing the signals.
Turning speciﬁcally to the guitar, the potential of tech-
nology to extend its possibilities has a long commercial and
academic history. Particular emphasis since the early 1980’s
has been given to augmenting the guitar rather than the
pick [15], including Zeta Mirror and Roland GK-series MIDI
guitars using hexaphonic pickups, or the more recent Moog
Guitar and Vo-96 that electromagnetically actuate the gui-
tar strings. Electromagnetic string actuation, which ﬁrst
came to prominence in the guitar world with the 1978 EBow
[1], remains a regular topic of research at NIME [8]. The in-
terested reader can ﬁnd a recent review of augmented guitar
systems in [11].
With respect to augmented guitar picks, there is a long
history of various sensors being integrated into picks, mostly
using force, bend and vibration sensors, or electrical con-
tacts with the strings. One of the ﬁrst examples of sensor-
augmented guitar pick dates to 1977: The Raymond Lee Or-
ganization patented a guitar pick containing a microphone
[4]. A 2014 patent of an augmented guitar pick [3] shows a
physical pick design containing a cavity to hold an electronic
sensor. In 2007 Vanegas presented at NIME a MIDI pick
that uses a force-sensing resistor on a guitar pick to control
musical events via MIDI [21]. In order to control diﬀerent
aspects of the performance, the player has to vary the pres-
sure on the guitar pick. Although this is a clever solution
to control the augmentation from the pick itself, it obliges
guitarists to learn and perform unconventional gestures.
The most recent augmented guitar pick is the PLXTRM
by Vets et al. [23]. PLXTRM is a sensor-enabled guitar
pick that includes an accelerometer, a piezo vibration sen-
sor, and a copper surface intended to make electrical contact
with the strings. It is used with a guitar pickup featuring a
separate audio output for each string and with a digital sig-
nal processing system designed to detect gestures from the
pick. By comparison, the Magpick uses a diﬀerent sensor
technology that works with any pickup and does not require
any additional installation on the guitar.
The Magpick works by sensing changes in magnetic ﬁeld.
Electric guitars have one or more pickups below the strings
in the area where guitarists typically strum. Each pickup
contains a set of high-strength permanent magnets that pro-
duce an ambient magnetic ﬁeld around the pickup that ex-
tends above the strings. The motion of the Magpick through
this ﬁeld generates an electrical signal that provides infor-
mation about the gestures of the guitarist’s plucking hand
in the vicinity of the pickups.
3. TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN
The pick itself contains a hollow channel with 4 loops of cop-
per magnet wire around the interior perimeter (Figure 2).
Figure 2: The architecture of the Magpick system.
By Faraday’s Law, a change in the magnetic ﬂux through
the loop enclosed by the wire will generate an electric volt-
age proportional to the rate of change. This is the same ba-
sic principle that underlies every magnetic pickup, including
the pickups in the electric guitar, but its application in the
Magpick presents an engineering challenge for two reasons.
First, the signal of interest is generated by the movement of
the Magpick relative to the permanent magnets in a nearby
guitar pickup. The Magpick is operated by human hands,
so its speed of motion will be relatively low compared to the
velocity of a vibrating string. Second, the Magpick contains
only a few turns of wire, instead of the hundreds or thou-
sands of turns found in most magnetic pickups. Since the
generated voltage is proportional to both the rate of change
of magnetic ﬂux and to the number of turns, the output
of the Magpick will be much smaller than other magnetic
pickups, on the order of microvolts.
3.1 Sensor Design
To maintain a usable signal-to-noise ratio with such a small
signal, two specialised ampliﬁer circuits were created of dif-
ferent topology. Figure 3a is a non-inverting proportional
ampliﬁer of gain (1+R2 /R1) = 304. The OPA1612 op-amp
features an extremely low voltage noise density of
1.1nV/
√
Hz. R1 and R2 are thin ﬁlm resistors, with the
smaller than usual 3.3Ω value of R1 minimising the Johnson
(thermal) noise in the feedback path. Because the Magpick
has a source impedance of <1Ω, Johnson noise is negligible
in the source signal itself. The proportional ampliﬁer pro-
vides an output voltage that scales with the velocity of the
Magpick relative to the pickup magnet. It is suitable for
detecting high-frequency transient events such as the snap
of the pick following plucking a string.
To detect slower, larger motions such as waving the Mag-
pick above the magnets, a diﬀerent ampliﬁer topology is
required. Figure 3b is an inverting leaky integrator with a
corner frequency of 1 /(2πC2R4) = 0 .7Hz. By integrating
the incoming signal, the output provides an approximate
measurement of the total quantity of motion of the Magpick.
The ADA4522 zero-drift (chopper) op-amp is chosen for its
extremely low input oﬀset voltage (5µV) and low 1/f noise,
allowing very high gains at low frequencies without being

and proportional (in orange) signals. The three
peaks correspond to three upward plucks of a single
string, with increasing speed of the plucking hand.
swamped by noise and drift. The low source impedance of
the Magpick allows a small input resistor R3 to be used
(6.8Ω), and the same input signal can simultaneously drive
both ampliﬁers.
The ampliﬁed signals (which we’ll now refer to as pick-
signals) are connected to two analog inputs of a Bela em-
bedded audio processing board [10], which was adopted for
its extremely low latency [14]. The signal from the electric
guitar (guitar-signal) itself is connected to a third input. In
the Bela board the three signals are combined using audio
computation (details in the following section) to generate
the signal to be sent to the guitar ampliﬁer.
3.2 Sound Design
The most signiﬁcant features of the pick-signals are: (i)
they are created only when the guitarist strums over the
pickup area (as opposed to over the fretboard, for instance);
(ii) they also respond to pick motion above the strings (not
necessarily touching them); and (iii) they sense the intensity
of movement with a wide dynamic range.
We spent several months studying the characteristics of
the proportional and integrator signals (Figure 4 compares
the two signals for a speciﬁc gesture) and to combine them
with the guitar-signal to create interesting musical output.
In this section we present three classes of possible combina-
tions, which are schematically represented using Pure Data
in Figure 5 (video examples can be found as supplementary
material).
3.2.1 Envelope control
The most direct combination of the pick-signal with the
guitar-signal is a simple multiplication of the two (Figure
5-left). The product of the multiplication is a signal whose
amplitude is controlled by the pick-signal and whose spec-
tral content is that of the guitar-signal. As a result, the
sound of the guitar is unchanged except for the volume,
which depends on the intensity of the pick-signal and thus
on the way in which the pick is interacting with the magnetic
ﬁeld of the pickups. The resulting sound can be described
as a volume swell: the attack and release of the notes are
always gradual as they are in eﬀect controlled by the Mag-
pick approaching (attack) and leaving (release) the pickup
area, which is never a sudden action.
The integrator preamp was used in this case given its ca-
pability to detect low-frequency gestures. In this condition,
air-strumming above the strings in the pickup area results
in a tremolo eﬀect: the signal created in the Magpick alter-
nates a high signal (when the hand moves perpendicularly to
the string, upwards or downwards) with a low signal (when
the hand stops its movement to invert the strumming di-
rection). In practical terms, this condition allows guitarists
Figure 5: Pseudocode showing the three classes of
sounds.
to control the envelope of the sound by moving the pick
above the strings after the strings are plucked. As an ex-
ample, to achieve a gradual attack, a guitarist would pluck
the string(s) on the fretboard and slowly move the plucking
hand holding the Magpick over the neck pickup. Then, she
could air-strum above the strings to control the sustain.
3.2.2 Effect control
In this condition, the output is a combination of: (i) the
guitar-signal sent to the output unprocessed plus (ii) an ef-
fected version of the guitar-signal with one or more param-
eters controlled by the pick-signal. Figure 5-centre shows
a pseudo-code for a reverb eﬀect in which the pick-signal
is used to control a parameter of a reverb like the reverb
time. The resulting eﬀect can be compared to a reverb pedal
whose room size level is determined by the interaction of the
pick with the magnetic ﬁeld of the pickups (pick-signal).
For the study described in the next section, we devel-
oped an audio-eﬀect, which we named harmonised delay,
that combines a typical delay with additive synthesis. This
sound is created by delaying the guitar sound and adding its
harmonic partials as identiﬁed by an FFT. To start with,
the eﬀect is triggered when the pick-signal goes above a
certain threshold. Then, the intensity of the pick-signal in-
ﬂuences two eﬀect parameters: the number of the generated
partials and the delay interval between them.
This solution allows guitarists to control the speed of
the arpeggios directly from the pick: the more intense the
strumming the higher the frequencies that are reached and
the shorter the delay between them (in a range from 0 to
255 ms). Consequently, a high pick-signal reaches high fre-
quencies and produces brighter harmonic sounds. The pro-
portional preamp was used for its rapid transients. This
eﬀect indeed relies on a fast peak detection of the signal
amplitude to determine the resulting sonic output.
3.2.3 Playing the pickup
In the third class of combinations, the guitar-signal is sent
in output unprocessed; in addition to this, the pick-signal
controls the volume of another sound source, which might
or might not depend on the guitar-signal. For instance, in
the case shown in Figure 5-right, the pick-signal controls the
volume of a noise source. Independently of the guitar sound,
which does not even need to be active, the movements of
the Magpick over the pickup area create their own sound,
giving the impression of being playing the pickups .
For our study we developed a sound design that we called
scrambled delay. The last 5 seconds of the guitar-signal
are stored in a buﬀer. Then a portion of the recorded audio
is randomly selected and played back at the original speed.
67
Figure 6: A close up of the wrist box, which contains
the preamp board.
The length of the selection varies each time randomly be-
tween 1 and 2 seconds. A fade-in and fade-out envelope is
also added to each played-back sound to improve the homo-
geneity of the output. Two of these played-back buﬀers are
active at the same time. The volume of the eﬀect is con-
trolled by the pick-signal using the integrator preamp. This
sound can be used as a sort of reversed delay on top of what
a guitarist is playing or might even “record” a short phrase
as per normal playing and then play it back, scrambled, by
moving the Magpick above the pickup area.
3.3 Physical design
The design and craft of the pick needed to take into account
two practical aspects. First, the pick had to be made of
durable material, due to constant friction with steel strings.
Second, it had to allow the magnet wire to be embedded
inside of it and a cable to come out of it. The shape of the
pick was designed through a series of iterative prototypes.
We initially used paper and clay prototypes, and we later
moved to 3D printed models. The ﬁnal shape (Figure 1)
resulted in a quite thick object that comines the familiar
aspect of a pick with an idiosyncratic aesthetic and allows
enough space for the coil to be embedded. At the same
time, the pointy shape with a thin tip allows fast picking.
The pick has a hollow cavity, covered with a cap, to allow a
copper wire to be wound inside. We tested several materials
for 3D printing or injection moulding, and the ﬁnal choice
was informed by durability and grip quality, as well as by
aesthetic and tactile components. In the end, we produced
picks with diﬀerent combinations of the two parts (i.e. the
hollow body and the cap) in acrylic, brass, and sandstone,
which diﬀered in feel and weight.
In the present implementation, the preampliﬁer is built
on a small printed circuit board that is external to the pick,
which was placed in a small 3D printed box that is strapped
to the guitarist‘s wrist or hand (Figure 6). The Bela pro-
cessing board was embedded in a custom-designed box with
two surface-mounted audio sockets connected to the board
for connecting the guitar (line in) and the ampliﬁer (line
out). The box also hosted a third socket to connect a cus-
tom made cable attached to the wrist box (Figure 7).
4. USER STUDY
We conducted a user study to investigate the potential of
the Magpick to extend the creative possibilities of electric
guitars. We recruited guitarists through email, newsletters,
and social media. We sought participants of varying gender,
cultural background, musical style, and skill level. We em-
ployed a snowball sampling method, in which participants
were asked to recommend others. 11 participants were re-

cruited (8M/3F, 4 nationalities, average age 40.3). Each
was assigned one of three sound designs: volume swell, har-
monised delay, or scrambled delay.
4.1 Protocol
The whole study lasted ﬁve days and was approved by the
ethics board at Queen Mary University of London and per-
formers were paid £50 for their participation. On the ﬁrst
day, participants came to the university to collect the Mag-
pick kit; then for three successive days they tested the
system at home and the last day they brought back the
kit. During the collection day, we presented our partici-
pants with the Magpick and connected it to the guitar they
brought along and to a guitar amp. We let them try out
the system for 10 minutes without giving them any infor-
mation about its nature and we then explained them how
it worked.
We asked participants to use the Magpick one hour a
day for three consecutive days. Each morning we contacted
them with a speciﬁc task to perform with the Magpick for
that day. On day 1, we asked them to explore some creative
uses of the pick. On day 2, we asked them to prepare a short
piece of 2 minutes or less using the Magpick and to send
over a video of them performing it 1. On day 3, we asked
them to notate the piece they composed the day before. We
intended these activities to oﬀer them some sense of purpose
and to collect material for our inquiry.
The ﬁfth day participants came back to return the kit
and we performed a video-recorded exit interview. We pre-
pared a set of questions that we hoped would stimulate dis-
cussions about their experience with the Magpick and we
asked participants to comment on the piece they recorded
while playing back their video from day 2 (video-cued recall
method), and to explain their notation. The interview was
conducted by one of the authors who is an electric guitar
player; this common interest and background helped engage
the participants as peers.
4.2 Analysis
The analysis of the data integrates the transcripts of the
interviews with the analysis of the playing techniques they
exhibited in the piece they sent over on day 2, as indepen-
dently analysed by two researchers. The interpretation of
this data evolved with several iterations of thematic analy-
sis. A deductive approach was adopted: we had pre-existing
coding frames through whose lenses we aimed to read our
research exploration.

tary material.

5. FINDINGS
In this section we elaborate upon the innovative uses that
guitarists made of the Magpick with a reference to the new
knowledge that is generated for the design of augmented
instruments. Given space constraints, further discussions
on the beneﬁts and drawbacks of the Magpick from the
point of view of human factors and performance practice
will be included in a dedicated publication.
5.1 Subtlety of interaction
Most participants were impressed by the extremely sub-
tle control allowed by the Magpick on the musical out-
put, which can’t usually be achieved by any other means.
William2 (who used the volume swell sound design), re-
ported: “ I just really like the ﬁne response of it. You can
get a lot more out of this in terms precision and speed. You
can‘t get that much with a pedal ”.
This subtle control is made possible by the precise sens-
ing of the pick movements that is directly transformed into
musical material. Notably, our participants did not have
to undergo a long re-learning process to use the augmenta-
tive potential of the Magpick. Rather, its potential of being
seamlessly integrated in typical guitar technique was evi-
dent from their ﬁrst encounter with the Magpick. During
the 10 minute explorations, some guitarists discovered at
least part of the new interaction possibilities, which usually
manifested as a moment of epiphany visibly marked by body
language indicating surprise, facial expressions, and/or ex-
clamations such as: “ Aha!”, “I see, I see... ”. After the
epiphany, three guitarists switched within seconds to mak-
ing music with the newly discovered behaviours. Thomas
(volume swell ), for instance, less than 5 seconds after the
epiphany, strummed a chord and controlled the rhythm by
waving his hand above the neck pickup.
The characteristic of being seamlessly integrated in ones’
performance practice is particularly important for the dis-
course around dimensionality that has been discussed in our
community [24, 18, 25]. The Magpick has a relatively simple
behaviour that has a high degree of detail and immediacy.
What the Magpick senses is a combination of pick position,
speed, and angle but it is not easy to describe compactly
in words. Nonetheless, guitarists managed to embody this
new technology within seconds and use its creative potential
straightaway. This ﬁnding suggests an approach to instru-
ment design and augmentation that diﬀers from a pursuit
of high-dimensional control and from attempts to create a
computational system that has an intelligent conceptual un-
derstanding of what the interaction means.
5.2 Locus of augmentation = locus of interac-
tion
William oﬀered another important comment related to in-
novative aspects of the Magpick: “ It‘s really interesting to
have that control in your hand. You got this eﬀect right in
your hand you can use if you want very subtle changes or
like extremely aﬀected sounds. It’s just right there, and you
can just move the pick and it responds, as opposed to pedals.
You can get a lot more out of this in terms of response as
opposed to trying to get your foot kind of all over the place.
It’s just really the convenience and easier adjustability just
by moving your hand ”. As several other participants, he
particularly enjoyed the double function of the Magpick that
worked both as a pick and as a device to control the aug-
mentations/eﬀects with. On this respect, Isla ( harmonised
delay) reﬂected: “I can control something at the same time
as playing when it comes oﬀ and on: that‘s the advantage ”.
2We will refer to participants using pseudonyms.
The augmented aspect of the Magpick can be controlled
by interacting with the hand-pick-guitar system as one nor-
mally would, with minimum adaptation (e.g. pick angle
and position, plucking intensity). In other words, in the
Magpick the locus of augmentation coincides with the locus
of interaction. The locus of interaction is on the pick, an
object that guitarists traditionally use to pluck the strings,
thus they have already internalised the sensorimotor skills
to control its subtleties. By contrast, devices that guitarists
normally use to control eﬀects are either operated by a
part of the body that guitarists have less precise control of
(pedal), force guitarists to stop performing and move their
hand in a diﬀerent position (knob), or require that they hold
a diﬀerent object that completely occupies the hand and is
only dedicated to the augmentation and not to the normal
interaction (EBow).
The co-location between interaction and augmentation is
a promising area of exploration. Some augmentations use
audio from the original instrument to drive feature extrac-
tion and resynthesis [19, 16]. Other augmentations co-locate
new sensors on top of existing parts of the body used to play
the original instrument (e.g. TouchKeys [9] which adds po-
sition sensing to the keyboard, or the control of digital ef-
fects through the guitar whammy bar [5]). More commonly,
the augmentation is controlled using parts of the body or
dedicated movements that are typically not employed for
this purpose (e.g. manipulating potentiometers [7], but-
tons or touchpads [2], proximity and pressure sensors [20]).
In these cases, the musician cannot rely upon established
sensorimotor skills and has to undergo a process of refamil-
iarisation, which is a deterrent to instrument uptake [13].
Coincident loci of interaction and augmentation also of-
fer guitarists visual and proprioceptive information on the
intensity of the eﬀect. Isla explained that when she wanted
to increase the level of the eﬀect she would just move closer
to one of the pickups, where the pick-signal is higher.
5.3 Effect ready to hand
When using the Magpick, guitarists do not have to decide
when to activate and deactivate the eﬀect, which is rather
always ready to hand. Two participants noted that the
intensity of the eﬀect can be gradually controlled in all in-
termediate levels by means of strumming position and in-
tensity. With traditional pedals this can be achieved only
with an expression pedal or by adjusting the knob on the
pedal, both options causing disruptions on the performance.
Having the eﬀect ready to hand lent the augmented as-
pect of the Magpick to be meaningfully used even for a few
instants, too. With this respect, William reported: “ With a
pedal I think it’s more like: Ok, I’m going to put this pedal
on and use it for a while. This (the Magpick) lends itself to
short changes in it ”. The analysis of the videos of guitarists’
pieces gave support to this idea: ﬁve of them clearly used
the augmentative potential of the Magpick just for a few
seconds to embellish the piece. James ( playing the pickup )
discussed: “I used it to trigger the eﬀect at the end of some
phrases. I played three chords and then I wanted to trig-
ger this eﬀect to create an atmospheric thingy after the last
chord. Then I went back back to a dry eﬀect to triggered the
eﬀect again after three chords. I liked activating the eﬀect
at the tail of what I was doing and being dry in the mid-
dle”. Isla had a similar use of the Magpick. In her piece she
mostly kept her plucking hand in between the pickups (no
eﬀect) and moved it on top of the bridge pickup (maximum
eﬀect) only at the end of the phrase to “ lift up the piece ”.
Having a continuous control on the sound directly on the
plucking hand allowed participants using the volume swell
condition to have continuous control over the sustain of the
69
guitar. This would be normally achieved by operating an
expression pedal, which cannot be used for fast and subtle
changes. With our technology, the envelope of the sound
can be controlled by air-plucking the Magpick on top of
the strings after a string is plucked. This property was
particularly appreciated by all the participants that had
the Magpick set with this sound design. Thomas compared
the feature of controlling the sustain of the note to bowing
the violin: “ You have the kind of control, like bow playing.
You can keep the note and change the shape of the sound.
This is really important ”.
6. CONCLUSION
We presented a new technology for electric guitars that em-
beds our own aesthetic and values, which are shared by
other designers of new DMIs [13], centered on exploring nu-
ances in music performance. In comparison to guitar and
pick augmentations that trigger events or add multiple di-
mensions of control, the Magpick explores the subtleties of a
single signal source within the pick through high-bandwidth
sensing. The signal behaviour contains a certain amount
of redundancy, whereby varying combinations of proximity,
angle, speed, and quantity of motion produce similar instan-
taneous outputs. This redundancy ultimately helps enable
a wide variety of distinctive performance techniques that
might have diﬀerent trajectories over time or interact with
traditional technique in diﬀerent ways. That the locus of
augmentation corresponds to the traditional locus of actua-
tion (i.e. the plucking hand) forces an integration of gestu-
ral language between traditional and extended techniques,
while the sound design that modiﬁes the guitar signal and
maintains the status of the augmented guitar as a single
instrument rather than the ﬁrst step toward a ‘theme park
one-man band’ [18].
As we developed the Magpick as a research explorations
there are several technical improvements that are possible,
some of which have been mentioned by the participants of
our study. In particular, the pick could be made wireless,
embedding the preampliﬁer circuitry along with a battery
(or even remote RF power), with a wireless transmitter
sending the Magpick-signal to an external sound processing
device. The Magpick-signal could also be provided directly
to the performer as a control signal for other eﬀects or in-
struments, such as through CV (control voltage) control for
modular synths, or through a user-programmable board.
