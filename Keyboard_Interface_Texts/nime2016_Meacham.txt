ABSTRACT
The“Laptop Accordion”co-opts the commodity laptop com-
puter to craft an expressive, whimsical accordion-like instru-
ment. It utilizes the opening and closing of the laptop screen
as a physical metaphor for accordion bellows, and the lap-
top keyboard as a musical buttonboard. Motion is tracked
using the laptop camera via optical ﬂow and mapped to con-
tinuous control over dynamics, while the sound is generated
in real-time. The instrument uses both skeuomorphic and
abstract onscreen graphics which further reinforce the core
mechanics of “squeezebox” instruments. The Laptop Accor-
dion provides several game modes, while overall oﬀering an
unconventional aesthetic experience in music making.

1. INTRODUCTION
Historically, electronic musical interfaces have appropriated
existing hardware in unexpected but expressive ways. By
exploring interactive elements on traditional musical instru-
ments and imagining their possible analogues on commod-
ity hardware, we can take advantage of existing musical
gestures and potentially recontextualize them. Designing
for widely-available computing devices beneﬁts from a low
barrier to entry (in terms of cost and experience) and famil-
iarity to the user, as well as new aesthetic and expressive
possibilities. These motivations led to the Laptop Accor-
dion (LA), which takes advantage of the simple opening-
and-closing action of nearly every modern laptop, utilizing
its front-facing camera as a primary input to the interface.
The interactions associated with the traditional instrument
are transferred to the digital artifact, combining a recog-
nizable instrument with an everyday computing device and
resulting in a whimsical, unconventional musical interface.
Given the simplicity of the idea, the ubiquitousness of lap-
tops, the proliferation of laptop orchestras, and the physical
similarity of opening and closing a laptop to that of an ac-
236
Figure 2: The Laptop Accordion (LA) tracks the

ical metaphor for the stretching and compression
of accordion bellows and the keyboard as a but-
tonboard. These inputs are mapped to real-time
generated audio.
cordion bellow, it is surprising to us that this idea has not
been implemented (or at least documented) before. (For
better or for worse, it seems somebody should have made
a laptop accordion by now!) As Perry Cook pointed out,
“existing instruments suggest new controllers” [1]. Further-
more, the ethos of musical design for the physical laptop is
well documented by Fiebrink et al. [2], and can be extended
to the approach of designing “backwards” from the device
in what Ge Wang calls “inside-out” design [3], as exempli-
ﬁed by physical mobile-phone instruments like the iPhone
“Ocarina.”
The LA draws from such systems of thinking about music
interaction design, setting aside the all-too-familiar physical
paradigms of the laptop—a user sitting in front of their
laptop as terminal and display—and (literally) turns this
notion on its side. The LA asks its user to rotate the laptop
90 degrees, face the screen away, hold it in a speciﬁc manner,
and engage with it on uncannily familiar physical terms. As
such, the laptop is recast into something else: a strange-yet-
familiar, whimsical musical interface.
Facing the screen and keyboard away from the user sug-
gests new forms of interaction (particularly with an “audi-
ence,”rather than the typical one-screen-one-user paradigm)
and UI challenges. Discussions of new musical interfaces of-
ten question the traditional laptop-based performance setup
where a performer faces the audience with a laptop in front
of them, engrossed in the information on the screen. A
time-honored complaint about this performance aesthetic is
that the performer looks as though they “might as well be
checking their email” rather than actively participating in
music creation. Furthermore, traditional DAW-based pro-
duction environments have become so ubiquitous that the
notion of a laptop as a physical instrument rather than a
software interface, sequencer, synthesizer, or processor of
musical data can be diﬃcult to conceive. This nearly un-
shakable stereotypical role of the laptop is what renders the
LA a compelling exercise in interaction design.

2. RELATED WORK
The design for the LA was inspired by previous notable
reappropriations of the physical laptop for musical ex-
pression. The Small Musically Expressive Laptop Toolkit
(SMELT), for instance, provides tools for developers to use
the physical interfaces of the laptop as controllers, including
the keyboard, microphone, and for those laptops with sud-
den motion sensors, the accelerometer [2]. In this work,
Fiebrink et al. articulated an ethos of co-opting laptop
hardware to transform the laptop into physical musical in-
terfaces (“don’t forget the laptop!”), and directly inﬂuenced
the use of a laptop hinge as a physical vehicle of expression.
In a less physical sense, live coding [4, 5] has re-examined
the aesthetics of live laptop performance.
The iPhone “Ocarina” [3] was designed almost purely by
working backwards from the available sensors and capabil-
ities on a smartphone, leveraging multitouch, accelerome-
ters, microphone, graphics, sound synthesis, and even net-
working and global positioning to craft a coherent musical
artifact. It made for an uncanny computer-mediated re-
envisioning of a real-world instrument.
As an augmented musical interface, Cook and Lieder’s
SqueezeVox [6, 7] provided additional context for an
accordion-style music controller. This notable set of
computer-mediated controllers didn’t so much co-opt the
laptop, but the accordion itself by augmenting it with
various sensors mapped to synthesis parameters. The
SqueezeVox project featured multiple instruments (named
Bart, Lisa, Maggie, and Santa’s Little Helper) that explored
using the physical accordion interactions as a controller for
singing synthesis.
The game modes of the LA, meanwhile, took direct
inspiration from the expressive and proactive interaction
paradigms in music games like Smule’s “Magic Piano” [8]
and, to a lesser extent, from the more reaction-based map-
pings of video games like Guitar Hero [9] and Rock Band
[10]. The ability to play a complex song with one’s own
pacing (such as in Magic Piano) is a design goal that was
factored into the LA, where diﬀerent diﬃculty levels aﬀord
a low barrier of entry as well as a high skill ceiling.
Finally, the laptop orchestra paradigm has further pro-
liferated the design of laptop-based musical interfaces [11],
and provides an ecosystem for continued development and
performance with the laptop [12, 13, 14].
3. DESIGN
The core mechanic at the center of the LA is the use of
the laptop hinge to simulate bellow movement, and the key-
board as a stand-in for the right-hand manual. The opening
and closing of the laptop screen is tracked in real-time by
computer vision analysis and motivated many design deci-
sions in creating the instrument. A primary goal was to
tap into the user’s notion for the action of an accordion
(whether based on prior experience with the instrument or
a passing familiarity) to minimize the learning curve.
A user familiar with the interaction of an accordion can
use the same gestures on the LA and expect a similar re-
sult. For users with no conception of an accordion, a brief
experimentation with the keys and screen rotation provides
an understanding of how to control its main musical param-
eters, dynamics and pitch, as well as the expressive and me-
chanical capabilities of the instrument, including polyphony
and using the keys or bellows to create diﬀerent articula-
tions, staccato or legato, just as would be the case with a
traditional acoustic accordion. Since the physicality is pre-
served, one can experiement with LA in the same manner
as the “real thing”.

Figure 3: Skeuomorphic bellows design.
Upon beginning the program, the laptop screen renders
a skeuomorphic representation of accordion bellows that
stretch and compress when the screen rotates or there is
movement in front of the camera. In this context, skeuomor-
phism refers to design cues that imitate the original instru-
ment, but are no longer “necessary” to perform the task of
sound production—whereas bellows are mechanically fun-
damental in acoustic accordions, the LA simply utilizes the
image of bellows to refer to the original functionality of the
instrument and as a vehicle for visual communication. The
immediate feedback provided by this skeuomorphic system
clues the user into the usage of the instrument without ex-
plicit directions, leaving them to explore the accordion on
their own terms.
As a tool for encouraging user engagement with the pro-
gram, skeuomorphism ties the virtual and the real accor-
dions together, creating a meaningful metaphor for begin-
ners without being explicit about the intended method of
playing the instrument. Secondly, the orientation of the
bellows on the screen (stretching and compressing along the
height) suggests a particular orientation of the laptop which
is more consistent with how one would hold an actual ac-
cordion, rather than sitting on a table or lap.
Figure 4: Alternate, non-skeuomorphic design.
A second visual style was created as an experimental, non-
skeuomorphic alternative to the accordion bellows, while
still retaining the graphical motion cues from before. In
particular, the graphics are comprised of a ﬁeld of particles
on a dark background that stretch and compress at the same
rate as the skeuomorphic accordion bellows. The intention
of this mode was to provide similar feedback for the motion
of the instrument without harkening back to the original in-
strument, allowing for a diﬀerent relationship between the
synthesis of accordion sounds and the associations these al-
ternative visuals might suggest.
Furthermore, an overlay interface gives visual feedback of
the keys being pressed (the basis for various game modes)
and allows selection of various musical parameters such as
scale, key, and pitch bend, as well as program parame-
ters, such as graphical style, fullscreen toggling, game mode
switching, and the pitch mapping layout.
Figure 5: Keyboard overlay in “Free Play” mode.
A laptop’s keyboard is congruent with a typical “button-
board” arrangement on an accordion-like instrument, but as
an input to a digital instrument aﬀords easy reprogramma-
bility of scales or other functionality. Traditional accordions
are, of course, limited to the notes they were constructed
to play, such as a diatonic scale in a single key. In its de-
fault state, the LA matches this capability, but the digital
nature of the instrument means that it can be extended for
a wide variety of musical styles. For example, playing along
with an ensemble can be simpliﬁed for a beginning user by
matching the key and limiting notes to a pentatonic scale,
but an advanced player could utilize the full chromatic key-
board, simply by remapping the keys.
In addition to the construction of the instrument and in-
terfaces, three modes of play were implemented in order
to aﬀord varying levels of skill and musical output control.
(1) Free play mode is the most similar to playing an actual
accordion. In this case, the keyboard is simply mapped to
the scale and key of the user’s choice, and the output pitches
directly correspond to the keys pressed while moving the
bellows. (2) Play through mode, by contrast, disregards the
conﬁgured key mapping, instead stepping through the MIDI
notes of a particular song, where any key press advances the
state to the next group of contemporaneous notes. The du-
rations of notes correspond solely to the length of each key
press, from key down to key up. (3) Finally, hard mode is
functionally equivalent to play through mode, but requires
users to step through a song by pressing a particular key,
indicated to the user in an interface reminiscent of games
like Guitar Hero.

4. IMPLEMENTATION
As with an acoustic accordion, sound production is primar-
ily contingent on two parameters: volume is controlled by
the rate at which the bellows are stretched and compressed,
and pitch is controlled by the buttonboard. These both have
corresponding mappings to the laptop itself, where bellows
rate is congruent with screen rotation rate and the button-
board is functionally identical to a keyboard.
Keeping with our interactive design goals, the sound out-
put of the instrument is a synthesized accordion, imple-
mented with SoundFont synthesis and MIDI controls using
the Fluidsynth library. The use of SoundFonts provided
acceptable real-time timbres while abstracting away many
complexities in sound production, allowing us to focus on
playability.
The main technical challenge of the LA is calculating
a good measure of screen rotation, which is accomplished
using the front-facing camera. The application is built
within the OpenFrameworks library, and utilizes a built-in
OpenCV (computer vision) add-on as well as a user-created
add-on, OfxCv. Together, these implement feature extrac-
tion and the tracking of an input image to calculate its
optical ﬂow, or the movement of image pixels between two
frames.
The OfxCv add-on utilizes an implementation of the
Lucas-Kanade algorithm for estimating optical ﬂow [15].
Using a recursively-built pyramidal representation of two
successive images, the algorithm approximates vector dis-
placements between tracked feature points, whose average
is a good predictor of motion in front of the camera, or,
in the LA case, the movement of the camera itself. Using
optical ﬂow for musical input can be traced to projects such
as SoFA, which used optical ﬂow to detect facial movement
[16]. Useful overviews of these algorithms can be found in
[17, 18].
As a brief technical note, the feature extraction step is not
strictly necessary, and algorithms [19] exist to compute the
so-called “dense optical ﬂow,” taking into account the move-
ment of all pixels between images. Considering all points
has the potential to oﬀer more accurate estimates of cam-
era motion, but in practice we found these procedures to be
insuﬃciently performant on many laptops, while the chosen
algorithm, which considers only extracted feature points,
seems to oﬀer a good blend of performance and accuracy.
The calculated velocity vector (with some conditioning)
controls the MIDI channel velocity, which is congruent to
the compression rate of an accordion’s bellows. Given the
goal of utilizing only sensors found on a typical laptop, this
calculation does not rely upon any external or non-standard
components.

5. EV ALUATION
The LA can be evaluated just as any new musical instru-
ment, since at its core it is a translation of an actual ac-
cordion. Since squeezebox-style instruments are already
well-deﬁned, the success of the LA can be gauged by its
emulation of the intrinsic musical aﬀordances of those in-
struments, as well as the presence of any new expressive
aﬀordances. As with a typical musical controller, quali-
ties of a useful invention include versatility, expressiveness,
learnability, and the intangible traits that result from the
idiosyncrasy of the instrument.
Since the target platform for the LA is unspeciﬁed con-
sumer hardware, its responsiveness is subject to hardware
speciﬁcations, the calculation of optical ﬂow, and operating
system latency, all of which may vary across systems. Two
speciﬁc metrics we found to be important were keyboard
latency and any bounds on simultaneous keypresses. Over-
coming these limitations would be a primary step in devel-
oping virtuosity on the instrument. Furthermore, while the
physical keyboard layout is ﬁxed and optimized for typing,
it is trivial to arbitrarily program keys to with respect to
scales, keys, or other novel pitch mappings.
Using optical ﬂow to track the opening and closing of the
laptop introduces some latency, which we estimate to be in
the 100 to 200 millisecond range. Fortunately, the latency
of this component, with proper ﬁltering, is less impactful
than the keyboard latency, which accounts for the primary
point of articulation in the sound and is far more responsive
(as a matter of hardware and software design).
Optical ﬂow, in essence, controls the volume envelope:
when the laptop screen is in motion, the user would still
need to press a key to begin the sound. The envelope value
at the point of articulation controls a note’s velocity, and
subsequently provides continuous control to further mod-
ulate the volume, making a variety of nuance possible. In
our informal user trials, participants report the main bellow-
and-buttonboard interaction to be natural and responsive.
The physical resistance of the screen hinge emulates the
feedback from air compression in traditional accordion bel-
lows, and presents an interesting opportunity to enhance
the perceived embodiment of the instrument. At the same
time, a practical question remains on structural wear-and-
tear of the laptop screen hinge under the stress of repeated
opening and closing. While this hasn’t caused issues in our
experiments, one should be mindful of the possibility.
Our existing repertoire of LA music includes The
Star-Spangled Banner , Auld Lang Syne , Erik Satie’s
Gymnop´ edies, Bach’s G Major Cello Suite , Vittorio Monti’s
Czardas, Claude Debussy’s Clair de Lune , Nikolai Rimsky-
Korsakov’s Scheherazade, Mozart’s Rondo Alla Turca (the
“Turkish March”), and the ever-popular Twinkle Twinkle
Little Star . The ﬂexibility of the instrument means that
the sky is the limit when it comes to play through mode—
any tune that lends itself to arrangement on the accordion
can be translated into a MIDI ﬁle and played with ease.
Performance with the LA is a largely unexplored arena,
but the possibility of novel performance practices was ap-
parent during the development of the instrument. In par-
ticular, since the camera tracks whatever features it sees,
waving a hand in front of the camera can be congruous to
opening and closing the laptop lid. Other actions, such as
moving in space or rotating one’s body provide similar in-
put, opening up a multitude of performance opportunities,
as well as suggesting the LA equivalent of a “palm mute”
gesture, where the camera is purposefully covered to prevent
unwanted motion detection.
Finally, the LA seems to be accessible for new users, while
providing a signiﬁcant skill ceiling for those who wish to
239
practice its various modes; a series of carefully-designed vi-
sual cues, for instance, teaches the instrument’s mechanics.
This range of diﬃculty can be adjusted between simplicity
for novices on the one hand, and on the other, sensitivity
for users advanced enough to exploit it. Above all, per-
haps, there is inherent charm in watching a performer hold
a laptop sideways and play a tune with it.
6. FUTURE WORK
Moving forward, there are several avenues for exploration
and improvement. The Laptop Accordion can beneﬁt from
more accurate simulation of the accordion sound, and exper-
imentation with abstract (non-accordion) sounds that lend
themselves to the interaction. In both cases, the instrument
could become a professional tool or a more fully realized ob-
jet d’art . Options for improved synthesis veracity include
physical modeling of the acoustic instrument or reproduc-
tion of samples from a variety of real-life instruments (such
as concertinas or accordions from diﬀerent time periods).
User studies would be extremely useful in determining the
capabilities of the LA with respect to skeuomorphic feed-
back and the possibility of virtuosity. Interesting topics
for study would be the preference of performers and audi-
ences for various interfaces (skeuomorphic or not), as well as
the system performance requirements to enable a virtuoso
player in pushing the instrument to its limits.
Cross-platform compatibility and modularity is another
distinct goal for the future, enabling more types of users
to experience and iterate on the software. While the ini-
tial artifact was intended as an exercise in design, future
projects could use the LA paradigm as a generalized con-
troller for other sounds (e.g. singing synthesis, like the
SqueezeVox). Options for increased modularity—in tandem
with the goals for sound production—include interchange-
able synthesis modules, as well as frameworks for driving
other engines (e.g. via MIDI or OpenSoundControl).
On a more mechanical level, the calculation of the aver-
age optical ﬂow is a relatively complex and expensive op-
eration, and therefore is not very well suited to slower de-
vices. Research into algorithms that provide good tracking
with lower computational cost (and possibly lower latency),
or even modiﬁcations to the current system, might extend
usability to older or low-cost devices, enabling a larger user-
base and the possibility of inexpensive musicianship. In ad-
dition, modiﬁcation of the synthesis system (as mentioned
above) could result in speed gains while lending additional
ﬂexibility in implementation.
Finally, while a range of music is currently being played
on the LA, the possibilities aﬀorded by instrument-speciﬁc
works are broad and of signiﬁcant interest. Considerations
such as networking and ensemble play are rich for explo-
ration, as is the use of the screen for the display of work-
speciﬁc artistic content. As previously noted, laptop orches-
tras like Stanford’s SLOrk provide an excellent incubator for
the vast possibilities of the instrument. We look forward to
creating dedicated works for the LA in exploring the possi-
bilities of various ensembles.
7. CONCLUSIONS
We designed, implemented, and evaluated an accordion-like
instrument based on the core components of a traditional
laptop. Our eﬀorts made use of oﬀ-the-shelf image process-
ing algorithms to track the motion of a laptop’s screen, serv-
ing as an analogue to the compression of accordion bellows,
which is in turn mapped to the volume of the synthesized
sound. The net result was a piece of software we found to
be accessible yet nuanced for musical expression.
Moreover, by prioritizing user experience and aesthetic
satisfaction in designing the Laptop Accordion, we devel-
oped an artifact that is functionally pleasing to use, and
aesthetically quirky. We believe that more potential for
musical expression exists in the tasteful, creative repurpos-
ing of existing technology, and we look to continuing this
line of design inquiry for future work.
