ABSTRACT
Awareness of playing movements can help a piano student
to improve technique. We are developing a piano pedagogy
application that uses sensor data of hand and arm move-
ment and generates feedback to increase movement aware-
ness. This paper reports on a method for analysis of piano
playing movements. The method allows to judge whether
an active movement in a joint has occurred during a given
time interval. This time interval may include one or more
touches. The problem is complicated by the fact that the
mechanical interaction between the arm and piano action
generates additional movements that are not under direct
control of the player. The analysis method is able to ig-
nore these movements and can therefore be used to provide
useful feedback.
1. INTRODUCTION
In the book “Famous Pianists and Their Technique” [8],
Gerig provides an extensive survey of the diﬀerent schools
of piano playing and teaching that have evolved over the
last centuries.
The early clavier methods [8, p. 9–34] can be charac-
terized by a passive arm and active ﬁngers. Arm move-
ment is used to change the horizontal position of the hand.
Some arm and hand movement is used for chord playing.
This technique is appropriate for the harpsichord, which is
a predecessor to the piano and has a very light touch in
comparison. The loudness of the generated sound is mainly
predetermined by the action of the harpsichord and can only
minimally be changed with force. However, an application
of large force results in typically unwanted percussive noise.
Therefore, ﬁnger activity is preferred over the forces of the
stronger arm.
The modern piano has a heavier touch and the percus-
sive sounds are less noticeable. Despite of this, playing
technique remained nearly unchanged during the transition
from harpsichord to piano. The so-called ﬁnger school had
a culmination in the work of Czerny (1791–1857) [8, p. 103–
120]. Czerny’s ` etudes, which to the present day have a place
in the curriculum, are eﬀective for training ﬁnger indepen-
dency and for becoming accustomed to reoccurring musical
patterns like scales, arpeggios, etc.

Deppe (1828–1890) was one of the ﬁrst inﬂuential peda-
gogues to put emphasis on the role of the arm [8, p. 229–
270]. Deppe contributed only few written records about his
method but his teachings were spread by his students. After
Deppe’s death, a multitude of books that emphasized the
functions of the arm were published. The most inﬂuential
follower of that trend was Karl Maria Breithaupt (1873–
1945), whose name is connected to the school of weight
technique [8, p. 329–359]. An important aspect of the Bre-
ithaupt’s method is the use arm weight to execute touches.
Breithaupt has been criticized for marginalizing the role of
the ﬁngers. He saw ﬁngers main function to be to transduce
arm forces to the keys. Furthermore, he has been criticized
to overly emphasize the role of weight and muscle relaxation
and to marginalize the role of active muscle work.
Ortmann (1889–1979) [8, p. 407–445] was one of the ﬁrst
to examine piano technique with scientiﬁc methods. For
this purpose he used various devices, some of them he in-
vented himself, to record playing movements. One of his
contributions is to conciliate ﬁnger and weight school. Both
the advantages of ﬁnger activity and arm activity should be
used. Fingers are ideal when speed is needed but lack the
strength and control of the arm. The arm on the other hand
lacks the speed of the ﬁngers because of its inertia.
The exercise book “20 Lessons in Keyboard Choreogra-
phy” [1] by the piano pedagogue Seymour Bernstein con-
tains a collection of movement lessons. Each movement
lesson starts with a brief description of the movement and
provides exercises subsequently. The exercises are typically
small pieces enriched with various notation marks to indi-
cate the movement (see Table 1).
The notation marks in Bernstein’s exercises can be
grouped according to the timing of the described movement.
There are marks that relate to a single touch (movements 1
to 6), marks that relate to movements that span several
successive touches (movements 12 to 14), marks that de-
scribe preparatory movements that occur before a touch
(movements 15 and 16), and marks that describe a prepara-
tory movement followed by a touch movement (movements 9
to 12). Movements that relate to a single touch can be an-
alyzed with the Probabilistic Arm Model (PAM) [11]. This
paper presents a method to analyze movements that span
several successive touches.

[4]. Wristen et al. studied compared movements when sight-

is used for tone production and extraneous movements be-
tween concert pianists, piano teachers, and students [5].
Goebl & Palmer studied the role of tactile information
gained when hitting the key from above for timing accuracy
[9]. Loehr & Palmer studied the eﬀects of mental chunking
[13] and ﬁnger independency [14]. Furuya et al. analyzed
octave repetition movements by calculating the inverse dy-
namics of the arm [7]. This allows to assess the gravita-
tional, key-reaction, limb interaction, and muscular torques
that are present in the arm and ﬁnger joints. A further
study examined diﬀerences in proximal-to-distal coordina-
tion of playing movements between novices and expert pi-
anists [6].
2.2 Instrument performance mining
Peiper et al. developed a method that distinguishes
ﬁve bowing patterns using electromagnetic motion cap-
ture data, namely d´ etach´ e, martel´ e, staccato, spiccato, and
legato [17]. The patterns are distinguished by a decision tree
based on geometric features, like initial bow position, and
movement features, like velocity, acceleration, and move-
ment continuity.
Rasamimanana et al. developed a method to distinguish
three bowing patterns based on accelerometer data, namely
d´ etach´ e, martel´ e, and spiccato [18]. Minimal and maxi-
mal acceleration and velocity during a bow stroke are de-
termined and used for classiﬁcation with k-NN. For this
purpose the velocity signal is computed by integrating the
acceleration signal.
Young developed a method to distinguish six common
bowing techniques, namely accented d´ etach´ e, d´ etach´ e lanc´ e,
lour´ e, martel´ e, staccato, and spiccato [22]. The classiﬁca-
tion is based on 6DOF inertial bow movement sensing and
measurement of vertical and lateral bow forces. The di-
mensionality of the sensor data is reduced using principal
component analysis. A stroke is classiﬁed in the resulting
low-dimensional space using k-NN.
A method to distinguish German and French drum grip
was developed by Bou¨ enard et al. [3]. The method iden-
tiﬁes characteristic local extrema of the stick trajectory in
the movement signal. The grips are distinguished using k-
nearest-neighbor (k-NN) based on the timing and the height
of the extrema of the stick trajectory.
3. PROBABILISTIC ARM MODEL
We coin conscious, goal-directed movements as primary
movements. Examples for primary movement in piano play-
ing are the movements of the ﬁngers, hands, and arms that
are used to press down the keys, reposition the hands, or
make a communicative gesture. Secondary movements are
movements that are not directly controlled. They are the
inevitable byproducts of the primary movements and are
due to the mechanical interaction with the piano action and
anatomical constraints of the body. The Probabilistic Arm
Model (PAM) [11] models primary and secondary move-
ment and is the basis for the analysis method described in
Section 4. Therefore, it will be brieﬂy reviewed here.
The human arm has mainly seven degrees of freedom.
When a note is played, the amount of movement in each
joint is computed from sensor data over a ﬁxed time interval
of 0.08 s. These measurements, which are denotedF1 to
F7, are composed of primary (M Pi ) and secondary ( MSi)
movements and measurement error (Ei):
Fi =MPi + MSi + Ei (1)
The sum of secondary movement and measurement error is
modeled as normally distributed, i. e.,MUi +Ei ∼N(µi,σi).
The mean µi and standard deviation σi of the distribution
are computed by evaluating an automatically learned func-
tionf. Because a primary movement in a joint can generate
secondary movements in other joints f is a function of the
primary movements of all other joints. The function f also
depends on the velocity of the pressed key ( Fv), which is
computed from the MIDI signal. As true measurements of
primary movements are not available,f is evaluated using
F1 to F7 as approximations for the primary movements.
(µi,σi) =fi(MP1,...,MPi−1 ,MPi+1 ,...,MP7,Fv) (2)
≈fi(F1,...,Fi−1,Fi+1,...,F7,Fv) (3)
The function f can be learned through maximum likeli-
hood estimation from a data-set of examples (see [11] for
details). By evaluating the learned function f the mean µi
and standard deviation σi of the secondary movement can
be determined.

that are spread over several notes. The method is based

on the output provided by PAM. PAM is used to compute
the mean and standard deviation of the secondary move-
ment for all notes that occur between the beginningt− to
the end t+ of the examined time interval (see Figure 1).
The determined means and variances for joint i are denoted
µi(1),µi(2),...,µ i(N) and σi(1),σi(2),...,σ i(N), where
N is the number of touches in the analysis interval. The es-
timation of secondary movement by PAM for a touch refers
to the movement during a short time interval that ends
when a note-on event is reported by the keyboard. The be-
ginning of that time interval for the n-th note is denoted
b(n)and the end, e(n).
A movement in joint i is recognized if the movement
Fi,total that is accumulated from t− to t+ exceeds the to-
tal mean of the secondary movement µi,total more than a
constant c times the total standard deviation σi,total, i. e.,
if Fi,total > µi,total ± c⋅σi,total. The total mean and the to-
tal standard deviation are computed from the means and
standard deviations of the single notes, which are provided
by PAM. When no note is played, the secondary movement
is set to zero since there is no mechanical interaction with
the piano action. In Figure 1, no secondary movement is
expected during the time intervals [t−,b(1)), (e(1),b(2)),
(e(2),b(3)), and (e(3),t+].
Let mi(t) be the sensor angular rate of the movement in
joint i, then Fi,total is the integral from t− to t+ of mi(t).

In the following two possibilities of computing the total
mean µi,total and total standard deviation σi,total will be
explained: a restricted version and a generalized version.
The restricted version requires that the beginningt− and
the end t+ does not intersect any interval [b(n),e(n)]. The
generalized version however does not require this.
In the restricted version the total mean of secondary
movement is computed by

according to the way of adding normally distributed random
variables.
The mean µi(n) and the standard deviation σi(n) of the
secondary movement of the n-th note refer to the secondary
movement accumulated over the time intervalb(n) to e(n).
In order to compute µi,total and σi,total in the generalized
form, it is necessary to distribute the valuesµi(n) and σi(n)
over the continuous time interval given byb(n) to e(n). For
this purpose, µi(n,t) and σi(n,t) are introduced. They are
the continuous mean and standard deviation in joint i based
on the PAM analysis of the n-th note.

The distribution of a random variable that is generated
by adding normally distributed random variables is also a
normally distributed random variable. The mean of the
new distribution is given by the sum of the original means,
i. e., µsum = ∑i µi, and the standard deviation is given by
σ2
sum = ∑i σ2
i . In order to distribute the mean and stan-
dard deviation computed by PAM over the time interval
[b(n),e(n)], the following equations, which are continuous
counterparts of the previously discussed formulas, have to
be satisﬁed:

b(n)
µi(n,t) dt=µi(n) (7)
/integral.disp
e(n)
b(n)
σi(n,t) 2 dt=σi(n)2 (8)
Therefore, µi(n,t) and σi(n,t) are computed in the time
interval from b(n) to e(n) as follows:
µi(n,t) =µi(n)/slash.left(e(n)− b(n)) (9)
σi(n,t) =σi(n)/slash.left
/radical.alt1
e(n) − b(n) (10)
Outside the time interval [b(n),e(n)] the continuous mean
µi(n,t) and the continuous standard deviation σi(n,t) are
set to zero.
The continuous mean µi(n,t) and the continuous stan-
dard deviation σi(n,t) are needed to handle eventual tem-
poral overlaps between secondary movements. The estima-
tion of the secondary movement of a note n by PAM refers
to the time interval[b(n),e(n)]. For two notes these time
intervals can either be separated in time or overlap. If the
time intervals overlap, the secondary movement generated
by the two touches are superimposed.

5. EV ALUATION
To determine the accuracy of serial analysis, the proposed
method was evaluated based on recorded movement with
our inertial sensors [10] and MIDI data from a pianist. The
pianist played small musical motifs without primary move-
ment of the arm and the same motifs but with forearm
rotation movement that was spread over several touches.
Since pitch, rhythm, loudness, and articulation can be var-
ied, there exist a prohibitively high number of combinations
so that the serial analysis has to be evaluated with exem-
plary motifs. The used motifs (see Figure 2) were modiﬁed
according to parameters that have a distinct inﬂuence on
the movement:
Number of notes:The ﬁrst motif contained four notes,
the second, six, and the third eight notes. The motifs,
which were played with the right hand, begin with as-
cending intervals, which may be played with supina-
tion, and end with the equal amount of descending
intervals, which may be played with pronation. Since

secondary movement is generated through mechanical
interaction with the piano action, a greater number
of interactions leads to a greater amount of secondary
movement, which makes primary movement detection
more diﬃcult.
Loudness: When playing louder, the amount of secondary
movement is increased because the secondary move-
ment is linked with the amount of mechanical interac-
tion between the arm and the piano action. Therefore,
the motifs were played with diﬀerent loudness: piano,
mezzoforte, and forte.
Tempo: The tempo has an eﬀect on the primary forearm
rotation. When playing faster, the rotation is per-
formed with greater speed. Furthermore, the over-
all size of the movement could be reduced at greater
speed, which would make primary movement detec-
tion more diﬃcult. The motifs were recorded at diﬀer-
ent tempos. The quarter note was played with 60, 100,
140, and 180 beats per minute. To generate a record-
ing that produces signiﬁcant overlaps in the analysis,
the player also arpeggiated the motifs. The player
sustained the highest and lowest note. The ascending
and descending intervals were then played in rapid
succession.
The mentioned variations result in 45 combinations. Each
combination was repeated 10 times with and 10 times with-
out forearm rotation movement so that 900 samples were
recorded in total.
In the four-note motif, the following movement was used:
The player begins to supinate shortly after playing c. The
e ﬂat and f sharp are played while the forearm supinates.
Shortly after the note f-sharp is reached, the player re-
verses the movement direction and plays the e-ﬂat and c
with pronation. The six- and eight-note motifs are executed
similarly. The player supinates when playing ascending in-
tervals and pronates when playing descending intervals.
To use the method, it is necessary to deﬁne the analysis
interval [t−,t+]. For detecting the supination movement,
the beginning of the analysis intervalt− was deﬁned halfway
between the ﬁrst and second note of a motif. The end of the
analysis intervalt+ is the onset time of the highest note. For
detecting pronation movement, t− and t+ were placed cor-
respondingly, the beginning of the analysis interval t+ was
deﬁned halfway between the highest note and the following
note. The end of the analysis intervalt+ was deﬁned as the
onset time of the lowest note.
A primary movement was detected if the total move-
ment Fi,total exceeds the total mean µi,total more than
a four times the total standard deviation σi,total, i. e., if
/divides.alt0Fi,total − µi,total/divides.alt0> c⋅σi,total with c = 4. The results are
shown in Table 2.
