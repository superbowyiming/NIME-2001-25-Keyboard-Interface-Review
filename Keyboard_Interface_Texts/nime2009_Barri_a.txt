Abstract
This paper introduces the new audiovisual sequencing 
system “Versum” that allows users to compose in three 
dimensions. In the present paper the conceptual soil from 
which this system has sprung is discussed first. Secondly, 
the basic concepts with which Versum operates are 
explained, providing a general idea of what is meant by 
sequencing in three dimensions and explaining what 
compositions made in Versum can look and sound like. 
Thirdly, the practical ways in which a composer can use 
Versum to make his own audiovisual compositions are 
presented by means of a more detailed description of the 
different graphical user interface elements. Fourthly, a 
short description is given of the modular structure of the 
software underlying Versum. Finally, several foresights 
regarding the directions in which Versum will continue 
to develop in the near future are presented. 
Keywords: audiovisual, sequencing, collaboration. 
1. Introduction
Versum is an audiovisual sequencer. Whereas most se-
quencers such as Ableton Live and Logic use two-dimen-
sional images to represent sequences of notes and 
sounds, Versum uses three-dimensional representations 
and allows the user to edit and run the sequence in three 
dimensions. For example, the sounds represented in 
Versum can not only be heard from left to right, they can 
also be heard from right to left, from up to down, form 
back to forth, in a spiraling motion, etc.  
2. Philosophy
2.1. Breaking down barriers 
Versum was born out of a need to break down the 
barriers that usually exist between an electronical 
musical composer and his audience. I felt that by letting 
the audience literally see how the composer works and 
how the composition is constructed, great value could be 
added to the listening experience.  
 Wanting to have the audience understand what’s 
going on in a composition however does not imply that 
the goal is to make all musical and visual events 
predictable. On the contrary, having the audience create 
expectations based upon their understanding of the 
perceived audiovisual structures can provide the basis for 
surprises, which are caused by the composer’s decision 
to deny these expectations. Both these expectations 
themselves and how they are resolved (or not) influence 
the way people perceive tension in music [1]. 
2.2. Audiovisual tension 
Perceived melodies and rhythmical patterns can instigate 
expectations in the listener with regard to future musical 
events. Musical tension can be created when the 
composer plays with these expectancies, by denying 
them at some times and realizing them at others. To 
paraphrase music theorist Leonard Meyer: when 
expected events do not occur, or when they are delayed, 
these expectancies produce a state of suspense in the 
listener. It is this suspense that music cannot do without 
[2].
 In Versum the listener has not only his ears to base 
predictions upon, but also his eyes. Therefore Versum 
enables the composer to create expectancies and build up 
tensions that are specifically audiovisual. 
2.3. Spatial relationships 
In clinical experimental settings spatial relationships 
between sounds have frequently been shown to interact 
with perceived musical attributes in systematic ways. 
Also the composer Hector Berlioz (1806-1869) has 
argued that the disposition of instruments in space should 
be considered an essential part of the composition [3]. 
Within Versum, the composer can easily make use of - 
and experiment with - the musical implications of spatial 
distributions of sounds, with clear visual feedback that 
enables the composer to keep track of the different 
positions where the sounds are coming from. 
3. Seeing and hearing Versum 
3.1. Entities
Within Versum, compositions consist of routes being 
traveled through a virtual universe. When viewing and 
listening to a composition, the software shows the 
viewpoint of the actor - a virtual moving camera with 
virtual microphones attached - in an infinite space. This 
can be seen in the Actor Window (see Figure 1). As the 
camera travels through this space, it travels past sound-
emitting three-dimensional shapes called entities.

Figure 1. The three windows of Versum
The closer an entity is, the bigger the amplitude of it’s 
sound, as recorded by the actor’s microphones. The 
sounds recorded by these microphones are then sent to 
their respective speakers, for the listeners to hear. Also, 
the perceived direction from which the sound comes will 
be the same as the direction in which the entity  is 
visually located. Every entity has parameters that 
influence both the sonic and the visual output, making 
sound and image analog to each other. For instance, 
smaller entities produce a sound with a smaller amplitude 
than bigger entities do and an entity depicted with a less 
smooth surface will produce a more noisy sound.  
 The user of Versum can place these entities anywhere 
in the virtual universe and can define relationships 
between them in terms of motion. For instance, entity A
can have entity B  orbiting around it, at a speed and radius 
defined by the user. Entity B may also have another two 
entities orbiting around it, and so forth. 
 In summary it is the combination of the properties 
and positions of entitiesand the position of the actor that 
determines the whole auditory and visual experience. 
3.2. Sound speed 
Versum also has a built in sound speed, meaning that 
each entity’s sound is delayed by a time proportional to 
the distance it has from each of the actor’s microphones. 
When the actor travels past entities, the distance of an 
entity to the microphones will decrease or increase with 
time, and so will the delay time of the sound.  When the 
distance will decrease or increase at high speeds, this 
changing of delay times will cause a clearly audible 
Doppler effect, increasing a sense of movement in the 
listener. At lower speeds the increasing and decreasing of 
sound delays will cause subtle phasing effects, thus 
bringing slight variations and liveliness to otherwise 
more static and monotonous sounds. 
4. Versum’s windows 
4.1. The Control Window 
Versum generates three output windows in total (see 
Figure 1). The Actor Window, through which the 
viewpoint of the actor can be seen, has already been 
discussed above. Then there are also two graphical user 
interface windows: the Control Window and the Navi-
gator Window. The Control Window contains interface 
elements which enable the user to set specific parameters 
of the entities such as pitch, noisiness, low pass cutoff 
frequency, etc. 
 The Navigator Window contains a two dimensional 
map, similar to the kind of map a radar would provide, 
depicting a portion of the virtual universe. The Navigator 
Window allows the user to zoom in and out, allowing for 
both very detailed and very broad views of the positions 
ofentities. Within this map entities can be easily added, 
deleted, copied, dragged and selected by using the mouse 
and several keyboard shortcuts. The Navigator Window 
also allows the user to quickly and easily move the 
position and camera angle of the actor, thus changing 
what can be heard and seen in the Actor Window.  
5. Future development 
An objective for the near future is to create the 
possibility of having multiple composers work within the 
same instance of Versum simultaneously. This would 
mean that each composer has his own interface and his 
ownactor to hear and see the virtual universe with. 
Thanks to the fact that the internal software of Versum 
actually consists of several modules working together, 
and the fact that these modules communicate via network 
protocols, there is no necessity for all of them to run on 
the same computer. One could therefore have multiple 
interfaces running on separate computers connected to 
the same instance of Versum via network cables or a 
wireless network. Composers could then work together 
on populating a virtual universe with entities, creating 
their own constellations or edit those of each other. 
 When this feature is implemented, Versum’s ability 
to have several actors roaming within the same space 
would mean that audience members could see and hear 
the same instance of Versum from different auditory and 
visual perspectives simultaneously, with each actor
travelling a separate path and generating a unique 
composition in the process.
