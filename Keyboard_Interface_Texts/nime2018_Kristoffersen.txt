ABSTRACT
In this paper we present a novel digital eﬀects controller
for electric guitar based upon the whammy bar as a user
interface. The goal with the project is to give guitarists
a way to interact with dynamic eﬀects control that feels
familiar to their instrument and playing style.
A 3D-printed prototype has been made. It replaces the
whammy bar of a traditional Fender vibrato system with
a sensor-equipped whammy bar. The functionality of the
present prototype includes separate readings of force ap-
plied towards and from the guitar body, as well as an end
knob for variable control. Further functionality includes a
hinged system allowing for digital eﬀect control either with
or without the mechanical manipulation of string tension.
By incorporating digital sensors to the idiomatic whammy
bar interface, one would potentially bring guitarists a high
level of control intimacy with the device, and thus lead to
a closer interaction with eﬀects.

1. INTRODUCTION
The primary aim for this project was to focus on the user
experience of eﬀect control for guitarists, and coming up
with design solutions that are tailor-made for this particular
instrument.
The whammy bar became the interface of choice due to
several factors concerning control intimacy, [19] embodi-
ment, [7] multimodal feedback, and compliance with visual
guitar aesthetics, as well as a sense of familiarity for gui-
tarists regarding gestural control. The impression is that
an incorporation of digital sensors to a well known inter-
face, would create a high level of control intimacy with the
device, and thus lead to an embodied interaction with ef-
fects. Using the whammy bar as an interface also allows

eﬀects to be controlled right at the onset/attack of the ex-
citation of the string, as well as bring a strong multimodal
feedback (haptic, visual, and aural) to the player.
Using a whammy bar for expressive eﬀect control provides
an interface that exploits the ﬁne motoric capabilities of the
hands, which are the main tools for musicians interacting
with their instrument. This puts timbral manipulation at
the forefront as a musical parameter, and due to the design
of the whammy bar, it does not create a sizable compro-
mise to normal guitar playing, as it allows for usage along
with regular right hand guitar techniques. There is also the
important factor of transparency, as in the degree of expe-
rienced match between the input and output of a device.[9]
Since the interface is designed as a general digital controller,
the aural feedback from the system is inevitably determined
by the player rather than the designer, but due to the ar-
guably strong haptic and visual feedback from the whammy
bar interface, a certain level of transparency is guaranteed.
2. CONTEXT
In this section we aim to show the project in a broader
context to clarify the motivation behind our research. We
will give a brief introduction to instrument augmentation,
eﬀect control, and the whammy bar system, as well as some
insight into 3D-printing technology, which was the chosen
production method for the prototype.
2.1 Augmented instruments
This research project is part of a larger augmented instru-
ment paradigm, where developers share the goal of ﬁnding
new ways for the musician to interact with their instrument
by transcending current design limitations.
There have been numerous research projects regarding
augmentation of many diﬀerent instruments, like [21, 3, 17,
26, 25, 28], and there have also been quite a few guitar-
oriented augmentation projects, and in speciﬁc within the
NIME community in recent years. [16, 6, 23, 5, 2, 11, 10]
Other equally important and relevant research to this
project, is the vast amount of general theory on product
design and human-computer interaction, (e.g. [20, 1, 13])
and more speciﬁcally theory relating to how instruments
and controllers are to be designed for the highest musical
value. [19, 8, 18, 12, 24]
2.2 Effect control for guitar
The possibilities for what guitarists can control have ad-
vanced considerably in recent years, both with hardware
(e.g. Kemper Proﬁler 1), and software (e.g. Positive Grid
BIAS FX2), but the fashion in which one controls these nu-
merous musical parameters available, have not seen much

development among conventional guitar players. The ﬂoor
based controllers still reign the market – both for discrete
eﬀect changes, and expressive control (expression pedals),
and this is probably due to that both hands are occupied
with playing in most conventional guitar playing techniques.
In recent years we have seen a growth of innovative com-
mercial eﬀect controllers being made, both add-on controllers
(Guitar Wing3, Aalberg AERO4, Source Audio Hot Hand5,
REVPAD6, and ACPAD 7), as well as guitars with built
in sensors like the Sensus Smart Guitar 8. This develop-
ment may be due to technological advances like Bluetooth
LE and more compact microprocessors, which have made
digital controllers more practically positioned on the gui-
tar itself, but it also suggests that there is great interest
in ﬁnding new user interfaces for guitarists to interact with
eﬀects.
When using the feet for timbral manipulation, it arguably
puts eﬀect control at the “periphery of the playing tech-
nique”.[16] The very concept of using the feet for gestural
control, points more towards a universal design, meaning it
is equally accustomed to other hand-played instruments.[14]
From a semantic perspective, one could argue that a gui-
tarist who uses ﬂoor based controllers is playing two in-
struments at once, as neither the physical construction nor
the gestural control of the pedals have any relation to the
deﬁnition of a guitar.
2.3 The Whammy Bar
The mechanical whammy bar is an example of an augmen-
tation of the guitar that has become widely embraced. Since
its introduction in the 1950‘s, the whammy bar has become
a standard peripheral on many guitars – the most famous
being the Fender Stratocaster. Its success can be boiled
down to two main factors: Characteristic aural results, and
a user interface that guitarists ﬁnd intuitive, enjoyable, and
easy to integrate with their playing style.
As far as we know, the whammy bar or a similar kind of
user interface, has yet to be used as an interface for gen-
eral eﬀect control for guitar. There are however related
products, like the electronic whammy bar on the Ibanez
IMG20109, and the Virtual Jeﬀ electronic pitch controller10.
This research project diﬀers in that it combines the mechan-
ical whammy bar system with digital control of any musical
parameter, as well as expanding the performance gesture
possibilities of the whammy bar user interface.
2.4 3D-printed hardware
3D-printing, or rapid prototyping, was used to make a func-
tional prototype of the whammy bar eﬀect controller, and
the choice was based on the several new possibilities this
technology yields. Rapid prototyping allows for a lean de-
velopment model, meaning that a product can be reﬁned
and improved through several iterations based on user feed-
back.[22] Making smaller batches of a product is far more
convenient compared to traditional production processes, as
one is not dependent on costly injection molds. It also al-
lows for greater ﬂexibility in product customization based
on individual user needs.[4] In addition, 3D-printing makes
global cooperation more convenient by way of sharing 3D-

models, PCB designs and simulation data, as well as 3D-
printing experiences and know-how, all which could favourably
aid the development process of the whammy bar digital ef-
fect controller.
3. THE DESIGN OF THE CONTROLLER
In this section we present the current 3D-printed prototype
in greater detail – how it functions and the intentions behind
the diﬀerent design choices. We also give brief suggestions
for possible eﬀect mappings.
3.1 Functionality
The prototype is designed to replace the vibrato arm on
a traditional Fender vibrato system with a sensor equipped
arm. The functionality of the present prototype is presented
in this chapter. See ﬁgure 1 for a depiction of the current
prototype, and please visit the referenced web link for a
video demonstration of the prototype.[15]
Figure 1: The current prototype of the controller
with explaining terms.
3.1.1 Two modes
The controller includes a hinged system allowing for digital
eﬀect control either with or without the mechanical manip-
ulation. This was seen as an important design choice, as
being forced to combine the mechanical and digital eﬀects
would limit the player‘s sonic possibilities considerably. In
both modes, a separate reading of data towards and from
the guitar body is possible, allowing for diﬀerent eﬀect set-
tings in either direction.
In the locked mode, the angle between the longer part
of the bar and the shorter end (placed in the bridge hole)
is ﬁxed. In this mode the guitarist is free to either use
the whammy bar purely for its mechanical eﬀect, or with
an added digital eﬀect. Example eﬀect mappings: The me-
chanical pitch shifting can be made more extreme by adding
a digital pitch eﬀect on top.
Using the unlocked mode means that the mechanical sys-
tem is not aﬀected by the player‘s use of the whammy bar,
thus the interface becomes a purely digital eﬀect controller.
Example eﬀect mappings: Sustain or swell.
An important aspect of the design in the unlocked mode
was the implementation of a spring system, as this would
allow the player to feel a type of haptic feedback similar to
a mechanical whammy bar system (see ﬁgure 2 and 4).
3.1.2 End knob
The prototype is equipped with an end knob that brings
variable digital control through a twisting motion. This
gives the unit an extra gestural control input compared to
the mechanical whammy bar. The choice of this added func-
tionality was based around two main factors:
•Having the knob in close proximity to both the right
hand and the whammy bar itself, maintains a low
latency between intention and action.
353
•Many whammy bars already come with a tip, thus
adding one for digital control would not breach any
established guitar aesthetics.
Haptic feedback was an important criterion for the user
interface as a whole, and since a rotary switch has a more
limited haptic response compared to the whammy bar with
springs, a tactile surface was designed for the guitarist to
maintain orientation without the need for a visual cue (see
ﬁgure 2). Example eﬀect mapping: Change of eﬀect preset.

surface. Right: Close up of the torsion spring.
3.2 Technical setup
As the main point of focus for this project was on user ex-
perience and not on the technical setup, we did not experi-
ment with innovative sensor technology, nor was this seen as
necessary to digitally measure the data from the guitarist‘s
playing. All that was used were two potentiometers and two
force sensitive resistors. To accommodate the small size of
the whammy bar, the sensors had to be as small as possible,
while at the same time yielding a satisfactory result in data
reading.
The two force sensitive resistors were placed on either
side of the short end of the bar to measure the applied force
from the guitarist‘s hand onto the vibrato arm (in locked
mode). Two sensors were needed in order to register force
from either upwards or downwards movement of the bar.
In the unlocked mode, a potentiometer takes over the
reading of data. The potentiometer is connected to an axle,
which again connects the two main parts of the arm (short
and long), and this results in a data reading that is propor-
tional to the up and down movements of the long arm.
A similar potentiometer is used to read movement of the
end knob. The present potentiometer has no indents, which
arguably makes it more suited for expressive control rather
than discrete changes (e.g. change of eﬀect preset).
An Arduino Uno was used to connect the sensors to a
computer running Ableton Live and the Arduino Max4Live
device from the Connection Kit bundle. This allowed for
an easy, yet eﬀective and functional, setup (See ﬁgure 3).

4. FUTURE WORK
Future work will focus on improving diﬀerent aspects of the
prototype to make it ready for user testing. First step is to
reprint the prototype with a more durable and stiﬀ material
(e.g. carbon ﬁber). Other improvements include a smaller
electronic circuit, wireless data transmission, a new design
for eﬃcient switching between locked and unlocked mode,
as well as better haptic feedback in the unlocked mode.
The idea for the latter is to install a spring system with
calibration of tension in accordance with the tension in the
mechanical vibrato system. Another goal is to make the
design adaptable to other common vibrato systems, as well
as to be used purely as a digital controller add-on for guitars
without a mechanical vibrato system.
4.0.1 Expanded functionality
During the research period, it became apparent that the
whammy bar as a user interface has an innate potential
that is not fully exploited in the purely mechanical systems
of today. By implementing sensor technology, this potential
can be brought to life. The current prototype hints at this
with the end knob control, as well as separate data reading
when pushing the vibrato arm towards and away from the
guitar body. Here we present two additional performance
gestures that have been found promising for eﬀect control:
•Linear motion along the length of the whammy
bar. A variable eﬀect control based on where on the bar
the ﬁnger touches. Example eﬀect mappings: A high pass
ﬁlter or overdrive to complement and enhance the change
in timbre when plucking the strings at diﬀerent distances
from the bridge.
•Circular motion of the whammy bar around its
pivot point in the bridge hole. With a digital read-
ing of this motion, it would allow the guitarist to use
the whammy bar for eﬀect control while performing tech-
niques like strumming, as the bar would follow along the
same axis as the gestural movement of the hand.Example
eﬀect mapping: The circular motion can be used to con-
trol volume swell. This eﬀect could also work favourably
354
in conjuction with the mechanical vibrato.
For a demonstration of these two possible features, see
referenced video at 1:50. [15]
5. CONCLUSION
In this research project we have made a functional proto-
type of a digital eﬀect controller based on the vibrato arm as
a user interface. The main goal was to design an expressive
digital eﬀect controller that feels accustomed to guitarist‘s
conventional playing styles, and thus bringing an uninter-
rupted interaction between timbral control and other mu-
sical parameters. Through the ﬁne motoric capabilities of
the hands, the interface also allows for an advanced level
of eﬀect control, and thus complies with the ideal of a “low
‘entry fee’ with no ceiling on virtuosity”.[27]
With further work, we aim to make a prototype that is
suitable for more widespread user testing among guitarists,
which certainly would beneﬁt the development process of
the whammy bar digital eﬀect controller.
