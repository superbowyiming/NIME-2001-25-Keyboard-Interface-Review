ABSTRACT
This paper describes a new algorithmic approach to instruk
mental musical composition that will allow composers to
explore in a ﬂexible way algorithmic solutions for diﬀerent
compositional tasksl Even though the use of computational
tools is a well established practice in contemporary instruk
mental compositioni the notation of such compositions is
still substantially a labour intensive process for the comk
poserl Integrated Algorithmic Composition eIACf uses a
ﬂuid system architecture where algorithmic generation of
notation is an integral part of the composition processl

1. INTRODUCTION
Algorithmic composition can be deﬁned as a composition
practice that employs formalized procedures ealgorithmsf

Apart from the manyante litteram examplesi algorithmic
musical composition has been proposed and practiced widely
starting from the ’snsl In particulari from the late ’sns a
computational perspective started spreading across the two
Western continents esee [o] for a detailed discussionfl An ink
teresting shift in perspective has occurred roughly from the
’tns up to present dayl The ﬁrst approaches to algorithmic
composition were driven by instrumental scoringl Buti even

The paper is organized as followsx ﬁrst IACmCAC approaches

two cases are presentedl
2. RACKBOX VS. GLUE ACHITECTURES
CAC systems are intended to aid the composer in the
computational manipulation of musical datax these datai
at the endi can be exploited in traditional score writingl
Typically based on Lispi CAC systems oﬀer a large body of
functionalitiesx pitchmrhythm operations remain the core of
the systemi with the inclusion of input modules for audio
analysis and sound synthesis modules in outputl All this
functionalities are typically accessible through a GUI envik
ronmentl While GUI is the main interface to the systemi
oﬀering an easier access for the less programmingkoriented
composeri a high degree of ﬂexibility is oﬀered by enabling
the user to extend the program via the Lisp languagel Stilli
CAC architectures are based on the assumption that new
functionalities must in some way be adapted to the hostk
ing environmentl A CAC application architecture can be
thought as a rackbox containing a certain number of modk
ules eFigure oi leftfx the box can leave large room for other
modules to be inserted in itl Still the container is solid
and consequently rigidi its capacity is ﬁnitei and the modk
ulesi in order to be insertedi must meet the requirements of
the box geometryl By reversing the perspectivei a diﬀerent
approach to computerkbased composition environments can

be conceivedp It can be noted that each of the elements
of the diagram in Figure s jleftk may be replaced by an
undetermined plethora of componentsp As a consequencen
instead of starting from a solid framework where to insert
modulesn it is possible to start from an indeﬁnite variety of
available modules to be plunged –when necessary– into an
open environment jFigure sn rightkp Such an environment
is ﬂuid because it is intended as a glue capable of attaching
diﬀerent modules togetherp This reversed perspective imo
plies a diﬀerent approach by the userp By deﬁnitionn a ﬂuid
system such as the discussed one cannot be implemented
in a closed applicationp On the contraryn a programming
language is the most ﬂexible way to glue together diﬀero
ent software modulesp Thusn in a ﬂuid systemn the como
munication among the modules can be operated by a gluo
ing language: the language writes scripts addressing each
module’s speciﬁc interface and executes them by calling the
related program from OSp The language is responsible for
symbolic manipulation representing the selected music feao
tures and for the communication with the modules in ino
putqoutputp Not every programming language is suitable
for such a gluing taskp Requirements can be summarized
as follows: higholeveln dynamic typingn richness in dynamic
data typesn interactivityn string processingn interfacing to
many system calls and librariesp The ﬁrst two requirements
are needed to let the composer concentrate on composition
algorithms and not to deal epgp with compilation or complex
project structure issuesn and to allow for continuous feedo
back while experimenting in compositionp The last two are
necessary in order to ensure the gluing mechanismp The reo
quirements for softwares modules are in fact programmabilo
ity and command line interfacingp Indeedn there is a strong
coupling between CAC systems and rackbox architectures:
CAC applications are oriented toward composers interested
in a computational approach to symbol manipulations but
are not programmers and are not interested in automatic
compositionp On the other siden an IAC approachn ipep a
fullyointegrated computational approach to music composio
tion including notationn can evidently beneﬁt from the ﬂexo
ibility of a ﬂuid systemp More speciﬁcallyn the case of autoo
matic notation generation demonstrates that a completely
algorithmic approach to composition can be achieved only
through a ﬂuid architecturep
3. AUTOMATIC MUSICAL NOTATION
Algorithmic composition requires to deﬁne a mapping
from data structures jthe output of composition algorithmsk
to a subset of notation symbols jthe ﬁnal output of instruo
mental composition practicekp In the “classic” approach to
algorithmic composition jFigure tkn this sensitive step is
performed in ﬁrst person by the composern whose work deo
ﬁnes the two extremes of the workﬂow: sqhe provides como
position parameter in input and deﬁnes algorithms; from a
certain data structure the computer generates a data list
in textual form; the composer controls the adequateness of
the outputn eventually modifying hisqher composition strato
egy; thenn sqhe proceeds to transcribe the data list in musio
cal notationp Finallyn sqhe evaluates the notational resultn
eventually modifying some steps of the processp To sumo
marizen with respect to the computer outputn the composer
works both as a compositionalqnotational controller and as
a transcriberp
The composition cycle thus requires two controls which are
iterated in two diﬀerent momentsp Before the transcriptionn
the composer can evaluate the generated data and foresee
speciﬁc issues that would raise up during transcriptionp Afo
ter the transcriptionn the same control can be carried out

by looking at the resulting notationp The control processes
are high level musical tasksn and potentially they can be
performed very quicklyn even in terms of the few seconds
necessary to have a glance at the resulting notesp On the
other handn the transcription step is a low level musical
taskn which is always very timeoconsuming –its timescale beo
ing typically measurable in hoursp This slowness depends
both on the complexity of notation in se and on the difo
ﬁculty to clearly anticipate from a data list the peculiaro
ity of the resulting notationp The crucial move towards
an IAC approach consequently requires to automatize the
transcription step jFigure tn from A to Bkp In this wayn
the composer can focus on the higher level aspects of cono
trol: this would speed up the composition cycle jsozk which
can be executed until a satisfying result is obtainedn thus
leading to an interactiven trialoandoerror methodologyp The
task of automatically generating musical notation is a privo
ileged example of the power andn at the same timen of the
necessity of a glueoconnectedn ﬂuid systemp CAC systems
proposes generic transcription algorithmsn intended to proo
vide a draft of a possible notational outputp Consequentlyn
even if the resulting scores can be quite sophisticatedn they
are still drafts to be reworked manually by the composerp
In an IAC approachn this handmade notational work is reo
versed into the deﬁnition of an algorithmic procedure for
the control of a notation modulep It must be stated clearly
that music notation cannot be derived exclusively from muo
sical data structures because notation information involves
graphic data which are autonomous from musical datan but
are important at the same degree for the ﬁnal composition
output: in shortn music notation is not only music represeno
tation j[y]kn and the composer must take into account bothp
Moren in real practice composition and notation are related
by a feedback loopn so that any decision on one side has alo
ways to be veriﬁed on the other onep A ﬂuid architecture is
indeed needed to automate such a taskn so that transcripo
tion modules can be opportunely deﬁned and ﬁneotunedp
Moren speciﬁc modules can be “plunged into the ﬂuid” to
meet the requirements of diﬀerent notations: as an examo
plen in the case of graphic notationn a drawing module may
ﬁt better that a musical notation onen even if the latter is

provided with some drawing capabilitiesg Examples of ﬂuid
architectures implementing IzC systems are described in
[jl] awhere they are referred as zutomatic Notation Genf
eratorsbe [n]e and [l]g In the rest of the papere we discuss
two cases of IzC where diﬀerent ﬂuid systems are designed
to ﬁt diﬀerent needse allowing for a complete algorithmic
control over the ﬁnal scoreg
4. GRAPHIC NOTATION
In the ﬁrst projecte the ﬁnal scores afor piano solob is comf
posed of a page in very large format azib containing graphf
ical notationg The formal composition model is a graph
and the notation mirrors visually the graph structure aFigf
ure lbg zll information associated to the graph data strucf
ture in the model has to be mapped into musichnotation
informatione so that notation can be generated automatif
callyg The score is made up of musical notation avertices
and edge labelsbe graphics agraph drawingbe text aperformf
ing annotationsb aFigure le rightbs all these components
must be provided by programmable modules and their outf
put integrated in an unique documentg z strong constraint
is that musical tradition requires high typographic quality
both for the overall document and for the speciﬁc musif
cal notation elementsg zs all the involved components are
alphabetic or geometrice vector graphic solutions are consef
quently neededg In generalee as standard GUI applications
are here not relevante the possible candidates shares a TEXf
based approach a[q]be igeg they are command languagese to
be input via textual interface and to be compiled in order
to generate a vectorial outputg Concerning musical notaf
tione among the possible candidates afor a review see [ji]be
LilyPonde while still sharing a TEXforiented approache enf
sures very high typesetting quality but on the same time
can be tailored for advanced usese has a simplee humanf
readable syntaxe it has undergone a fast development and
it is now the most common textfbased music notation apf
plicationg LilyPond scripting solves the problems of generf
ating standard notation for the vertices of the graphe but
the resulting ﬁles aone for each vertexe in pdfhps formatb
must then be included into the drawing of the graphic nof
tationg It is interesting to see that many candidates are
ﬁtting in this caseg LATEX and ConTEXt are two typesetf
ting systems for document preparation implemented as a
set of TEX macrosg Both allow to work together with adf
vanced graphic packagesg ConTEXt a[o]b has been chosen
as it provides direct support for the MetaPost graphic lanf
guage and extends it by adding a superset of macros anamed
“Metafun”b explicitly oriented towards design drawing aeggg
allowing pdf inclusionbg For this particular projecte Python
has been chosen as the gluing languages it has a remarkf
ably clear syntax and meets all the previously discussed
requirements for an IzC languageg Python takes into acf
count all composition data processinge igeg graph generation
and manipulation algorithmse and also the gluinge scripting
processg The Python modulee named Scalptor a“engraver”be
generates the score by writing text ﬁles containing code for
each of the involved modules and calling each module in
order to render itg
5. SPECTRAL COMPOSITION
zs previously notede an IzC system should provide room
for inserting modules specialized in audio analysisg znalyf
sis parameters can then be processed and used as starting
material for musical compositiong Figure m represents an
implementation of an IzC ﬂuid system for a composition
project involving parameter extraction from audio signalsg
In particulare the commission was to use as starting material
an excerpt from Sophocles’Antigone which was read by a
philologist so to respect as possible the reconstructed Greek
classic pronunciationg Three voices sing melodies generated
from data resulting from the analysis of the original auf
dio ﬁlee in particular from the fundamental frequency and
the ﬁrst two formantsg The Praat software has been chof
sen for the analysis taske being it specialized in phonetic
processingg The SuperCollider application a[jk]e hence on
SCb has been chosen both as system glue and as an audio
modules as a languagee SuperCollider is rich in data strucf
turee highly expressivee provides an interfaces to the OS
environmente allows for string manipulationt as an audio
servere it provides statefoffthefart sound processingg Most
importantlye from a UI perspectivee SC allows for interacf
tive sessions and provides also programmable GUIsg Comf

6. CONCLUSIONS
The case of musical notation is particularly relevant in
demonstrating the need Sand the strengthT of a ﬂuid archiX
tecture for an integrated algorithmic composition systemY
zn itselfW notation is not a simple mapping from musical data
to notation symbolsW as it requires the composer to provide
speciﬁc typographic informationY rn zrt approach allows
the composer to develop caseXspeciﬁc solutions to such a
problemW by plunging the selected modules into a ﬂuid sysX
temk indeedW these can include not only notation but eYgY
many diﬀerent UzsY The maximum ﬂexibility is evidently
gained by using an interactive language as a system glueY
