ABSTRACT
This short article presents a reductionist infra-instrument. It concerns a yellow die-cast 
aluminium box only featuring a key switch and a 1/4” TRS balanced audio output as its 
UI. On the turn of the key, the device performs a certain poem in Morse code and via 
very low frequency acoustic pulses; in this way, it transforms poetry into bursts of 
intense acoustic energy that may resonate a hosting architecture and any human 
bodies therein. It is argued that the instrument functions at the very same time as a 
critical/speculative electronic object, as an ad-hoc performance instrument, and as a 
piece of (conceptual) art on its own sake.

Introduction and Background
Albeit not the most prominent trend in NIME research, speculative, post-optimal and 
non market/capitalist oriented approaches to UI design are actively researched and 
discussed in a number of resources. Drawing upon prior veins in experimental 
electronic instruments, concerning e.g. circuit-bending [1] or hardware-hacking [2], 
Bowers and Archer give a detailed account of instruments with restricted interactive 
potential (infra-instruments) in [3]. Therein, they provide a specimen of several such 
cases and  outline a few different construction strategies of sort (e.g. break/restrict an 
existing instrument, include obvious mistakes in the design, etc). 
NIMEs that meant to hinder (rather than expand) music expression, or that are 
intended more as a form of inquiry than expression, are encountered in various other

contexts, too. Ad-hoc approaches to media art and electronics design are discussed in 
[4], [5], [6]. Several cases of minimalist, purposely dysfunctional, user-unfriendly, or 
plain ‘weird’ instruments/interfaces are encountered, e.g., in [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]—to 
give a few examples. Radically reductionist approaches are discussed in [12], wherein 
just one knob is deemed enough to “rule them all”, and [13], wherein raw/literal 
material inquiry becomes a NIME. 
Research veins of sort echo concerns of critical design, concerning experimental 
practices that lie well outside canonical functionality ideals—ones that are generally 
better understood as playful explorations rather than as technological solutions to 
properly defined user problems. Or, as in this case too, concerning what else an 
instrument/interface may be other than merely the means to expanded/enhanced 
musical expression or to some sort of virtuosity. Design research as the means to 
articulate critique and/or to explore the more-than-functional/more-than-optimal 
potential of electronic objects is elaborated upon in great lengths in [14]. Expanding 
upon this body of research, in [15] Dunne advances the idea of interface design as a 
way to conceptualise, inquire, speculate, and, possibly, bring forth alternative 
(imaginary) futures (rather than just as the means to implement the ones that appear 
feasible within a market/capitalist dominated economy).

In tandem with the aforementioned empirical veins and also reverberating concerns of 
critical/speculative design, this short article presents a reductionist infra-instrument, 
intended—at the very same time—as a critical/speculative apparatus and as an ad hoc 
instrument to facilitate a given audio performance. As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2,  
it is made of a yellow die-cast aluminium box and has a minimalist UI: just a key switch 
and a 1/4” TRS balanced audio output to connect to a PA system. On the turn of the 
key, the device performs a certain poem in Morse code with trains of very low 
frequency sonic bursts. The poem is by the author and entitled ‘Sentience’; no further 
information on it are provided, so that only those with the appropriate skills in Morse 
Code would be able to decipher it. Keeping the poem unintelligible to only but a few is 
in-line with the conceptual logic governing the overall design: the instrument is 
radically simple, yet ambiguous in several different respects (as to be further 
explained).

The instrument is meant to be connected to a powerful (array of) subwoofers and, once 
‘unlocked’, let alone perform Sentience in its entirety and unattended. Accordingly, it 
functions as a text to physical energy transformer: converting poetry into bursts of 
physical vibrations that would make a hosting architecture, and any human bodies in 
it, resonate. In this fashion, poetry turns to rhythm that is physically felt through one’s 
body, as well as through space and one’s visceral sensation of it;—yet, the semantics of 
the original meaning are preserved at a structural level. 
Indeed, Morse code is easily recognised as such by the general public as a well 
established means of communication, even if it is largely unintelligible outside very 
specific milieux (such as amateur radio or aeronautical navigation). A certain dialectic 
opposition is forged in this way: clarity of design vs unintelligibility, functional 
ambiguity and some certain awkwardness/absurdity (why reproduce poetry through an 
alphabet most people recognise as such but fail to decipher?). Far from a theoretical 
nuance, this opposition is set out  in material terms and through the instruments’s

overall design. It should be then noted, that the interface and its material qualities, the 
specifics of operation, the selection of this particular poem, and the adoption of Morse 
code are all closely related traits that have emerged simultaneously in the context of 
the very same artistic experiment and as a response to what could be made fit a yellow 
die-cast aluminium box with a key switch and a 1/4" TRS balanced audio output.
Having briefly introduced the instrument and some relevant background context, the 
next sections details its technical implementation; the one after that outlines related 
offshoots and concludes this short article.  
Implementation
The instrument pivots on an ATTny85 micro-controller, programmed to reproduce 
Sentience in Morse code whenever a logical  appears in port pin (hence on, PB) 
1, and then halt. When triggered accordingly, it will generate a train of square wave 
pulses of frequency  with a Morse code dot length  . 
These parameters are programmed with two trimmer resistors and through the 
voltages arriving at PB2 and PB3, respectively and in real time (converted to 8-bit 
integers via the ATiny85 built-in analogue-to-digital convertors). 
Figure 3 illustrates the circuity built around the ATTiny85 chip and in order to convert 
the square wave pulses into a signal that can accurately drive a professional PA 
system. Power comes from a  battery: a TLE2426 IC is used to create a virtual 
reference ground at  (with respect to the negative battery terminal), creating two 
power supply rails at  with respect to this reference ground. Bypass and 
stabilising capacitors are included between the power rails, as well as around each IC 
used.

ATTiny85’s PB0 holds the generated pulses that alternate between digital  ( ) 
and digital  ( ). The subsequent network of stacked RC low-pass filters both 
attenuates and smooths these square waves, turning them to a train of imperfect sine-
waves pulses. The filter topology and the values for  and  are such so 
that a cut-off frequency of around  with a steep curve is achieved. A simple 
source-follower comes next, implemented with a  JFET transistor. The coupling 
capacitor  forms a very smooth high-pass filter with —with the cut-off frequency 
around , that removes any DC before the source-follower stage. This stage 
provides current amplification and, most importantly, lowers the impedance to prepare 
the signal for the next stage—note that the IC used therein has an input impedance of 
just .
The final stage revolves around a THAT1646 output line driver IC. The coupling 
capacitor  blocks any unwanted DC, while  drives any leakage current to DC 
ground, so that the signal swings above and below the reference ground. A  
capacitor is used in parallel with each pair of the balanced audio signal output to 
completely remove any remaining high frequency noise/hiss, so that very clean and 
significantly smoothed low-frequency pulses eventually arrive at the output. (The two 
 resistors are meant to just provide a path to ground when there’s no signal at 
the output.) The output amplitude is at around  , and the output impedance is

. Note that this circuit features no voltage regulation, so that the output’s amplitude 
level would naturally drop significantly as the battery dies out—the device is only 
meant to be used with a fresh battery.
Figure 4 shows the eventual implementation of the circuity inside the instrument, and 
Figure 5 the back of the perforated board used (some components are soldered 
therein). When in a new hosting architecture, the  instrument should be tuned via the 
two trimmers, so that the output pulses are in just the right frequency to resonate the 
space as intended, and so that the Morse code is the one that makes more sense in 
some particular performance context. Once tuned, the device can be then used to 
transmit Sentience when turned on with its unique key. A top view of the built 
instrument is shown in Figure 6.

Discussion & Conclusion
This article presents a reductionist instrument that only features a  key switch and a 
balanced audio output to drive a PA. Despite the evident similarities with related 
empirical research veins, as outlined in the Background  section, there are a few 
important differences to be straightaway noticed. Unlike the case of, e.g. [12], 
reductionist design here does not serve an expansionist agenda, nor does it collapse to 
merely restricting performance potential or fuelling non canonical interaction 
schemata. The key switch is only featured as a humble ON/OFF switch to be used just 
once—in a more dramatic fashion—and not as the means to allow for continuous 
interaction.
While arguably an infra-instrument proper, the apparatus does not fit any of the 
categories enumerated in [3]. The most relevant one is probably the “Take something 
non-instrumental and find the instrument within” (with a DTMF phone dialer and a 
Figure 6

Geiger counter brought up as examples). Something non-instrumental—that is, Morse 
code communication technology—is indeed encountered here; but this is just one out 
of the instrument’s many other idiosyncrasies, and certainly not what makes it makes 
an infra-instrument out of it. There are much more straightforward ways to transmit 
Morse code if that was the main trait—let aside that doing so employing such low 
frequencies is very untypical. The key switch could be thought of, instead, as such a 
prominent non-instrumental aspect; but again, this is just another of the device’s 
features, and certainly not wherein its (infra-)instrumenthood lies (we would still have 
a reductionist instrument if there was a knob instead of the key switch). The latter is 
probably to be found in the particular tension generated when all these material 
characteristics are juxtaposed with one another, as well with the generated audio and 
the unintelligibility of the poem.
Another more or less distinct quality relates with the instrument’s overall minimalist, 
clean and clear-cut design (some have even called it ‘cute’). The device’s appearance is 
largely atypical when considering the experimental NIMEs presented in  [1] , [2], [6], 
[7], [8], [11] ,or [13]—to bring some examples. Clear-cut design is, of course, 
occasionally encountered in an experimental NIME context, but primarily as the means 
to more functional/optimal UIs rather than the contrary. Herein, it is much more 
reminiscent of, e.g., neoplasticism,  early minimalist sculpture, speculative design 
practices encountered in everyday objects, or certain trends in conceptual art. Indeed, 
as is often the case with certain minimalist or conceptualist historical veins, simplicity 
of form alongside some semantic ambiguity (or absurdity) does allow an object (or a 
process) become a probe through which qualities of perception and/or material may be 
foregrounded. 
As a sonic instrument it certainly has a rather ‘strange’ UI. Key switches only 
exceptionally, if at all, appear in either commercial or experimental electronic 
instruments. EMS Synthi100 does feature a key lock, but merely as the main ON/OFF 
switch of an otherwise monstrous modular synthesis system; given the cost of this 
instrument, the key switch’s role must have been to rather restrict access to only those 
entitled to do so (as is often the case with expensive pianos, too). The author is not 
aware of any instrument wherein a key switch is used as the sole, or at least as the 
primary means to  interaction with it. This fact alone ascribes the device announced 
herein a certain ‘uncanniness’. Questions regarding the device’s purpose naturally 
arise, of course. The presence of the audio jack does not help: other than somehow 
generating audio, it is not at all evident what should happen when one turns the key.

More importantly, what does eventually happen when one does so, is both  uncommon, 
and disproportionally intense for such a tiny device: poetry is deconstructed into 
bursts of loud low frequency pulses. It should not be taken for granted that an 
audience would immediately realise that these trains of pulses are an actual text 
transmission that can be properly read and, even those who do realise this fact would 
most likely fail to understand the meaning of it—this remains forever disclosed to all 
but just a privileged few that happen to have the necessary skills. 
Accordingly, there is a prominent element of  ‘drama’, concerning both the 
instrument’s design as well as its being used to facilitate a performance. The logic of 
the UI is both very gestural and dramatic in its minimalism. These qualities are further 
accelerated by the instrument’s physical dimensions and overall appearance that do 
not announce its function and that are rather disproportional to it. The device may be 
deemed  speculative/critical on the level of instrument/interface design alone. There is 
a certain tension between its constituents and its operation, it is evidently a non 
market/capitalist oriented instrument that does look weird and does function somehow 
strangely; more, it looks somehow different even compared to other DIY/experimental 
infra-instruments. On its own sake, a performance with it bears the marks of a more 
conceptual approach to (sound) art: transmitting poetry in a fashion that would cast it 
physically/phenomenologically intense and visceral, yet largely incomprehensible to all 
but some. 
Thence, this device is an ad hoc instrument meant to facilitate a performance as much 
as it is a conceptual statement on its own sake. Summing up, then, it can be said to 
simultaneously embody three different roles: (a) it is a  critical/speculative electronic 
object, questioning some of the norms associated with standard HCI and market-
oriented UIs (and maybe, to some certain extend, also some of the ones associated 
with experimental and post-optimal NIMEs); (b) it is an ad-hoc instrument that 
facilitates an experimental performance with rather prominent gestural/dramatic 
qualities; (c) it can be thought of as a piece of (conceptual) art on its own sake, 
capturing a certain uncanniness in its design and exemplifying a certain tension 
between its individual hardware constituents (pair of keys, key switch, audio output) 
and its related cultural bearings.
