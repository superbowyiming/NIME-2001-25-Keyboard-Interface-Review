ABSTRACT
MM-RT (material and magnet - rhythm and timbre) is a
tabletop musical instrument equipped with electromagnetic
actuators to oﬀer a new paradigm of musical expression and
exploration. After expanding on prior work with electro-
magnetic instrument actuation and tabletop musical inter-
faces, the paper explains why and how MM-RT, through
its physicality and ergonomics, has been designed specif-
ically for musical wonderers: people who want to know
more about music in installation, concert, and everyday
contexts. Those wonderers aspire to interpret and explore
music rather than focussing on a technically correct real-
ization of music. Informed by this vision, we then describe
the design and technical implementation of this tabletop
musical instrument. The paper concludes with discussions
about future works and how to trigger musical wonderers’
sonic curiosity to encounter, explore, invent, and organize
sounds for music creation using a musical instrument like
MM-RT.

1. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIV ATION
MM-RT is a tabletop musical instrument that expands on
an interface for musical expression created by the author in
2011 called DrumTop [25]. DrumTop uses impulses from
voice coils as sound actuation mechanism to turn every-
day objects into percussive musical instruments. The ob-
jective in making DrumTop was to create a simple physical
interface that gives voice to random and found objects, af-
fords self-expression and immediate engagement for novices,
and encourages everyone to explore the musical potential of
their surroundings. With DrumTop, the potential for gen-
erating new sounds was in the hands of the players. Their
creative expressions were stimulated by what they found

.
around them and how they decided to play and combine
everyday objects on the tabletop interface to make music.

installed beneath each pad.
Players are generally very surprised when experiencing
DrumTop for the ﬁrst time. They react with genuine ex-
citement and quickly grasp the basic concept of the system:
you place any objects on any of the 8 pads and choose a
drumming rhythms that you can change interactively. Part
of the attraction for novices lies in the simplicity of the in-
strument that can be used as a percussive drum sequencer.
But this simplicity is also limiting if the players want to or-
chestrate a full range of music with the addition of melodic
and harmonic patterns. One solution is to incorporate a
loudspeaker system that accompanies DrumTop. Our solu-
tion was to keep the aspect of using physical objects and
realize ways to increase sound variation in a similar conﬁg-
uration as DrumTop. This is when we started to develop
MM-RT.
MM-RT employs electromagnetic actuators and small per-
manent magnets to physically induce sound signals into var-
ious artifacts (See Figure 1). Through our experiments with
MM-RT, we found that applying digital sound synthesis
techniques on electromagnetic actuators coupled with per-
manent magnets on physical objects increases the number
of sound variations a player can obtain beyond percussion
sounds. MM-RT can not only be used to generate rhythms
and percussive sounds like DrumTop does, but also be used
to generate drones, melodic patterns, and abstract granular
textural sounds through various objects by making use of
mechanical/acoustic sound synthesis technique [3, 6]. As
Berdahl et al., notes, such technique can also make musical
interactions more intuitive for both players and audience.
Players of MM-RT can directly touch electronic music
with their own hands through any non-magnetic object cou-
pled with a permanent magnet. We experimented with a
wide range of objects and some that work particularly well
include cups, plates, boxes, bottles, vase, jars, paper of plas-
tic containers, tubes, shakers, books, CD cases, teapots,
and etc. The permanent magnet can be coupled in diﬀer-
186
ent ways, either ﬁxed to the surface of the object or simply
enclosed inside the object in the case of boxes, bottles, and
tall jars. When, for example, a non-magnetic box, with a
permanent magnet inside, is placed on top of an electro-
magnetic actuator equipped pad, a sawtooth wave gener-
ated through the actuator can rapidly move the permanent
magnet to bounce and hit the walls of the box, causing
the production of acoustic sounds similar to what a digital
granular synthesis may generate.
MM-RT is designed for interpreting and exploring music
rather than for emphasizing a technically correct realization
of music. In doing so, we target a population that we call
musical wonderers: people who want to ﬁnd out more about
music in installation, concert, and everyday contexts. MM-
RT, a musical instrument for musical wonderers, focuses
on turning our environments into musical instruments and
materials for composition. It assists listening experience
by enabling players to directly touch electronic music with
their own hands.
2. RELATED WORKS
Electromagnets are pervasive and used in electronic devices
ranging from loudspeakers, motors, hard disks, and gen-
erators. In particular, loudspeakers are one of the most
essential tools to researchers, engineers, and artists work-
ing with electronic music. Loudspeakers are very practical
for new musical interface designers, but they also decouple
the actual sound source from the musical interface, leading
audiences and artists to a disembodied experience of music
[5, 8]. Cook notes that this ambiguity in sound production
is caused by the design practice of separating the controller
from the synthesizer which is the case with most modern
digital musical instrument designs [7].
There are exceptions to this design practice. One way is
to co-locate the loudspeaker or transducer with the interface
of musical instruments [22, 26]. Another is to use electro-
magnets to design actuated musical instruments [23]. Since
the core design of MM-RT involves electromagnetic actua-
tors, this section emphasizes on prior works associated with
the use of electromagnets.
2.1 Electromagnetically Augmented Musical
Instruments
In recent years, the NIME community has seen a trend to
apply electromagnetic actuators to augment existing acous-
tic musical instruments. McPherson demonstrates two types
of objects that can be actuated with a magnetic force: ei-
ther a magnetized object or a ferromagnetic object [13].
The actuator design for the augmented instrument may dif-
fer based on the object, but the fundamental technology
and techniques are broadly applicable to both.
Existing augmented musical instruments include, but not
limited to, piano, vibraphone, and drum [2, 4, 19]. Electro-
magnetism in such musical instruments demonstrates the
fundamental techniques in how existing instruments can be
expanded, often with additional sensors. The technical and
aesthetic decisions that the creators made for these elec-
tromagnetic instruments anticipate the future new musical
instruments that incorporate the eﬀect of electromagnetism.
2.2 Musical Interaction using Electromagnets
We also ﬁnd examples of using electromagnetic eﬀect in
designing unique musical instruments/interactions, as op-
posed to simply augmenting existing musical instruments.
Electromagnetic tagging system in Paradiso et al., utilizes
realtime tracking of passively tagged objects with a reader
to create musical interaction [16]. Rowland demonstrates
the use of printed loudspeakers with gloves equipped with
magnets to realize colocated surface sound interaction [21].
Musical interaction created in this project is unique in that
players not only hear sounds but get direct tactile feedback
from the magnet on the glove. These projects show that
electromagnetic eﬀects can also be used to create musical
interactions that are intuitive for musical novices.
2.3 Tangible Tabletop Musical Interface
Tangible tabletop musical interfaces typically fuse physical
and virtual environments with a projector and a camera
to display useful musical information around the physical
artifacts to the players [12, 17]. Players of tangible table-
top musical interfaces often manipulate physical artifacts
on tabletop surfaces to build and modify musical topolo-
gies [10]. These tabletop interfaces enable players to freely
and quickly move around physical objects on a tabletop
surface to progressively aﬀect the sound outcome. The de-
sign aproach in these projects demonstrates ways to visually
guide players in understanding the current musical state of
the system. Tangible scores and the Sound of Touch which
treat a physical interface as a score of a musical instru-
ment and are also fascinating projects to think about how
to explicitly indicate the players the state of the musical
instrument [24, 14].
We recognize that most tangible tabletop interfaces for
musical purpose revolve around the use of computer vision
technology. While the physical object themselves do not
produce sound, they tend to focus on the manipulation of
physical objects to aﬀect the resulting musical outcome.

RT.
3. IMPLEMENTATION
MM-RT consists of four identical areas. Each of them con-
tains a small display for feedback; a button and two poten-
tiometers for controls; and a ﬂat circular area called pad to
place objects (See Figure 2). With MM-RT, any magnetic
or ferromagnetic objects can become musical sound sources.
By placing an object on the pad, it becomes musically acti-
vated in one of four ways called the musical modes: percus-
sion, melody, grain, and microphone input. By playing on
the four pads simultaneously, the players layer sounds into
a complex interactive musical composition.
The dot matrix display is utilized to inform the player
what musical mode a pad is currently in. A button is for
switching between diﬀerent musical modes. Dynamics and
timbre on MM-RT are controlled using knobs which ma-
nipulate electromagnet actuation strength, pulse frequency,
187
and waveforms. Figure 3 shows the cross section of a single
pad on MM-RT. As we can see from the ﬁgure, an electro-
magnet (actuator), control by a waveform, is placed right
beneath the pad so that any objects placed on top of the
pad have a minimal distance to the actuator. The distance
between an actuator and an object can be as close as 3mm
to make best use of the magnetic force.
Figure 3: A cross section of a pad on MM-RT. A
container with a permanent object is used as an
example object a player can put on top of the pad.
3.1 Percussion Pad Design
In order to replicate the percussion mode we had in Drum-
Top, we designed a custom 3D printed solenoid in a pad
format (See Figure 5). This custom solenoid pad contains
a permanent magnet at the bottom so that when the mag-
netic force is applied, the pad is mechanically constrained
to move vertically. The solenoid is designed to move up to
4mm. The surrounding materials of the pad are composed
of masonite board and a neoprene sheet. Each solenoid pad
has four circular velcro points to stay ﬁrmly attached to
MM-RT.
Figure 4: A percussion pad that attaches on top of
MM-RT. A custom 3D printed solenoid is attached
in the center of the pad. (a) A solenoid at rest. (b)
A solenoid actuated.
We experimented with what type of electromagnetic wave-
form the custom solenoid pad mechanically reacts the best
(See ﬁgure 7). In general, the DC oﬀset was set higher than
0 for all waveforms to ensure they stay positive to push
the solenoid upward and avoid pulling down when negative
signals are applied. Using an impulse signal exhibited no
mechanical response on the custom solenoid (Figure 7-a).
We suspect that this is because the time interval of the
impulse is too short for the electromagnets to exhibit any
magnetic force on the solenoid. Applying a half cycle of a
cosine or square wave (Figure 7-b and 7-c) resulted in double
triggering the solenoid where the transient of the waveform
happens. In the case of a cosine wave, the displacement
of the solenoid was reduced by approximately half in com-
parison to square wave. We think that this is because the
transient of a cosine wave is much longer than that of a
square wave and the electromagnet is not capable of ap-
plying the instantaneous force on the solenoid. Sawtooth
wave (Figure 7-d) demonstrated the best result in correctly
moving the solenoid as desired. From this experiment, we
found that the solenoid is sensitive to the transient of the
waveform being used.

ior with diﬀerent electromagnetic waveforms. Red
lines represent the audio signal generated by the
computer and dotted blue lines correspond to the
approximate behavior of the solenoid. Waveforms

tooth.
3.2 Software
MM-RT software consists of three parts: Arduino1, NW.js2,
and SuperCollider 3 (See Figure 4). Arduino, a microcon-
troller designed for building an interactive application, is
responsible for acquiring knob and button data as well as
rendering graphics on 8x8 dot matrix display. An applica-
tion written in NW.js, a Node.js module designed for writ-
ing a desktop application using web technologies, acts as
a bridge between Arduino and SuperCollider to translate
OSC messages to Serial data and vice versa. NW.js also
handles the graphic rendering for the 8x8 dot matrix display.
SuperCollider, a text-based audio programming language,
is responsible for keeping the timing among four pads on
MM-RT and generating the audio signal. The signal from
SuperCollider is then ampliﬁed before reaching the electro-
magnets.
Figure 6: Software Architecture
3.3 Visual Representation of Musical Mode
The tricolor 8x8 dot matrix displays in MM-RT play a major
role in informing the players about the current musical mode
of each pad. In fact, without an object to react to the
electromagnet, the magnetic force generated by a musical

188
mode and its parameters are invisible to the naked eye.
When the force of an actuator is changed with a knob, the
brightness of the display changes to indicate the strength.
As such, a diﬀerent musical mode realizes diﬀerent display
behaviors.
Figure 6 depicts the four display representations simu-
lated in the NW.js bridge application, each one correspond-
ing to one of four musical modes. In the percussion mode
(Figure 6-a), the matrix is divided into rows and columns
to mimic the step sequencer like interface. A green color
indicates on state and a black color represents oﬀ state.
A yellow color cursor is utilized to show which beat a se-
quencer is currently on. The visual representation for the
melody mode (Figure 6-b) functions the same way as the
percussion mode but with added pitch information when
the step sequencer turns to on state. The grain mode is
represented with a sine-like waveform and the frequency of
a generated audio signal aﬀects the horizontal scroll rate of
the display. The microphone input mode displays the am-
plitude level of the microphone input. The amplitude value
is shown with square shapes with changing size in 10 steps.

modes. Modes are: (a) Percussion, (b) Melody, (c)
Grain, and (d) Microphone Input.
4. MUSICAL MODES OF MM-RT
MM-RT players are free to design their own objects. How-
ever, there are some restrictions and guidances on what
type of objects work best depending on the musical mode
of the machine. MM-RT currently has four musical modes
–percussion, melody, grain, and microphone input– to ac-
commodate diﬀerent kind of musical interaction.
4.1 Percussion
The percussion mode inherits most of the functionalities
from DrumTop with one major diﬀerence. In DrumTop,
each pad was represented as a beat in a measure. Since
DrumTop has 8 pads, the total number of beats was con-
strained to 8 beats in which a step sequencer sweep through
in a looping fashion. In the MM-RT percussion mode, each
pad is treated as a separate step sequencer but with one
master clock that syncs the tempo across all pads. The
drum patterns for the pads are preprogrammed and the
players can scrub through diﬀerent patterns using one of
the potentiometers.
In the percussion mode, the object must not be magnetic
as the magnetic force is applied through the added cus-
tom percussion pad described earlier. Since the maximum
displacement of the solenoid is about 4mm, the percussion
mode prefers objects that are ﬂat on the bottom. If, for ex-
ample, an object has a foot that raises the bottom surface,
the tip of the solenoid will not be able to reach the object
and no sound will be produced from the object. We are
also aware that the heavier the object gets, the softer the
resulting sound gets.
4.2 Melody
Just as the percussion mode, the melody mode is also driven
with a step sequencer. In this mode, a pitched sound is gen-
erated. While there are many ways to produce a pitched
sound using waveforms, we are currently using a sawtooth
wave for simplicity and exprimentation. The melodic pat-
terns are also preprogrammed and the players can scan
through diﬀerent patterns using one of the potentiometers.
Since the preprogrammed melodic patterns are described
only with interval relationship, the players have additional
capability to change the root note of the melodic pattern
being played if MM-RT is connected to an external midi
keyboard.
The most eﬀective object the players could use in this
mode is hollow objects such as a box, balloon, and bucket
that resonate well with a speciﬁc frequency. The players
can even add rocks, sands, and beads inside the objects to
physically aﬀect the resulting pitched sound.
4.3 Grain
The grain mode exhibits a granular-synthesis-like behavior
with physical objects. Currently, the audio signal generated
for this mode also utilizes a sawtooth wave between 1hz and
60hz. The player can change the rate of the sawtooth wave
using one of the potentiometers.
A typical conﬁguration of an object in this mode is to use
a non-magnetic closed container with a permanent magnet
trapped inside (See Figure 3 for example). This way, the
magnet is free to move around the container when it is ap-
plied with a magnetic force. We also obtained interesting
results using cups, bottles, and vases that have a tall side
wall so that a magnet cannot easily jump out. Utilizing a
ballon equipped with a magnet creates a surprising sound
eﬀect since the balloon resonates very well around 30 60hz
producing low frequency rumbling.
4.4 Microphone Input
The microphone input mode routes externally generated au-
dio signals directly in to the electromagnetic actuators. The
players are not restricted, but we often use this mode for
real-time cal collaboration with other musicians. This mode
requires practice to reﬁne what objects can be used depend-
ing on what kind of sound is picked up through the micro-
phone being used. Any objects described in the previous
three modes can work in this mode in investigating what
type of objects might work the best. We have so far exper-
imented with taking a cello sound and found that objects
used in the grain mode were most eﬀective in generating
interesting sounds.
5. DISCUSSION
Neuromusic researchers claim that all people are capable
of demonstrating musicality to some extent [18]. This is
an enlightening ﬁnding, but music interaction designers can
still beneﬁt from considering how diﬃcult and rewarding a
music system is to the players of diﬀerent skill levels. This is
because, often in particular with music, an appropriate level
of diﬃculty can lead to a long-term engagement and ﬂow-
like experience, a mental state in which a person performing
an activity is fully immersed in a feeling [9].
On the one hand, easy-to-master music systems can result
in immediate pleasure and fun, but they may prohibit the
interests of players for a further musical evolution [27]. On
the other hand, music systems that are hard to use can
discourage beginners. This design consideration is known as
the low-ﬂoor/high-ceiling criteria [20] and creating musical
systems that satisfy both is a quest for musical instrument
designers.

5.1 Musical Wonderers
Our goal in developing MM-RT is to enable anyone in-
terested in music, regardless of their skill levels, to easily
learn the instrument but also encourage them to develop
advanced skills and sound production through hours of prac-
tice. Such music players focus on the aspects of music in-
terpretation rather than on technically correct realization.
We call such players musical wonderers whom their musi-
cal mental model is set to encounter, explore, invent, and
organize sounds for music creation. To set MM-RT to this
interaction design constraint, we deﬁne a framework that
realizes musical exploration environments for musical won-
derers that feature the following capabilities:
1. Help players think like a composer and musician
2. Turn the environment into musical instruments and
materials for composition
3. Explicitly expose musical parameters through an er-
gonomic interface of a musical instrument
4. Assist listening experience with other sensory modal-
ities to explore sounds
Following this framework, MM-RT reduces the musical
wonderers’ cognitive load and lead them to focus on sounds
as a creative medium to interact with in both short- and
long-term contexts. MM-RT oﬀers the basis of music to the
player including loudness, pitch, timbre, and duration [11].
5.2 Evaluation
As one way to evaluate MM-RT, we have employed the in-
strument in performance contexts. In fall 2016, we per-
formed professionally at the Packard concert hall in Col-
orado College, the University of Vermont Recital Hall in
Vermont, and the Lincoln Center in NY. These performances
were a collaboration between an MM-RT player and a cello
player. MM-RT in these performances also involved the in-
tensive use of theicrophone input mode as it is the most
ideal way to collaborate with other musicians to correlate
the sound event generated from other instruments in real
time.
We have so far conducted the evaluation of MM-RT through
performances which require consideration from four per-
spectives: the audience, the performer, the composer, and
the instrument designer [15]. Digital Musical Instruments
(DMIs) are typically made for musical performances involv-
ing at least an audience and a performer. In this context,
a DMI is typically evaluated by audiences for its aesthetic
quality of music and eﬀectiveness to convey musical infor-
mation. A performer typically evaluates a DMI from its
playability: how challenging the instrument is to master
and how engaging the instrument is to develop virtuosity
with. Furthermore, a performer requires a score or instruc-
tions prepared by the composer who needs to understand
the mechanism of that DMI to be able to write a music piece
for it. In this sense, composers evaluate DMIs in terms of
how robust their musical eﬀect is. Finally, DMI is designed
by an instrument designer who typically thinks through the
design speciﬁcation and playing experience of that DMI in
mind.
Through our three performances, we found two limiting
factors about the current MM-RT design. The loudness
of the acoustic sound generated from MM-RT can be too
soft in a large performance space. To increase the dynamic
range of sounds produced by MM-RT in concert halls, we
employed a pair of microphones to amplify the resulting
sound via loudspeakers. Another limiting factor is the diﬃ-
cultly for the audience to see the subtle musical interaction
from the audience seat in big concert halls.

tween MM-RT and Cello players. Photo courtesy

6. FUTURE WORK
We have thus far mostly experimented MM-RT using an
electromagnetic sawtooth wave for almost all the musical
modes. In moving forward, we would like to continue to
experiment using diﬀerent synthesis methods. For instance,
we think that using a band-limited pulse generator can po-
tentially improve the richness of timbre coming out of a
resonating object when used in the melody mode. Since
the generator is often used for acoustic measurements and
assumed to have ﬂat power spectrum across all harmonics,
applying such signal to a hollow object can bring up the
natural resonant frequency of that object, making the re-
sulting sound closer to how the object will sound in everyday
context [1].
We are also considering the use of core-less electromag-
net to avoid permanent magnets to be constantly attracted
to the core of electromagnet actutor even when it is not
in use. Although not having a ferromagnetic or magnetic
core in the design of electromagnets reduces the eﬀect of
magnetic force, we think that this approach might enable
the instrument to maximize the translation of electrical to
mechanical motion much more eﬃcient in a tabletop con-
ﬁguration.
Another near future improvement of MM-RT is to im-
plement operational transconductance ampliﬁers suggested
by [13] instead of using an audio ampliﬁer which is largely
based on voltage ampliﬁcation.
We also recognize that the instrument needs an additional
interface to control the global parameters of the instrument
instead of relying on an external MIDI controller. Imple-
menting such functionality will eliminate the need for ex-
ternal MIDI controller.
We strive to expand on applying mechanical constraints
on permanent magnets to increase diﬀerent musical modes.
For example, we believe that if we can design a system to
mechanically constrain a permanent magnet to spin in a
circular motion, MM-RT may be able to produce similar
sounds produced by a Tibetan bowl.
7. CONCLUSION
We presented MM-RT, a tabletop musical instrument equipped
with electromagnetic actuators that oﬀers a new paradigm
190
of musical expression and exploration. It is inspired by pre-
ceding works on electromagnetically driven instruments and
tangible tabletop musical interfaces. The instrument is in-
tended for musical wonderers who encounter, explore, in-
vent, and organize sounds for their music creation. Mu-
sical wonderers focus on interpreting and exploring music
rather than technically correct realization. We described
the design and technical implementation of MM-RT. It also
discussed about a framework that takes in account musical
wonderers in designing a musical instrument. The paper
touched on future works and how to trigger musical won-
derers’ sonic curiosity to encounter, explore, invent, and or-
ganize sounds for music creation using a musical instrument
like MM-RT.
