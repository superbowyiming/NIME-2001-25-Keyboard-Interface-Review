ABSTRACT
In this paper, we describe a novel multimedia system for
networked musical collaboration. Our system, calledMonad,
oﬀers a 3D virtual environment that can be shared by mul-
tiple participants to collaborate remotely on a musical per-
formance. With Monad, we explore how various features
of this environment in relation to game mechanics, network
architecture, and audiovisual aesthetics can be used to mit-
igate problems inherent to networked musical performance,
such as time delays, data loss, and reduced agency of users.
Finally, we describe the results of a series of qualitative user
studies that illustrate the eﬀectiveness of some of our design
decisions with two separate versions of Monad.

1. INTRODUCTION
Musical collaboration over a network diﬀers from perform-
ing with other musicians in the same physical space in many
ways. For instance, a lack of embodied interaction can
impede the communication between the participants of a
networked performance. Furthermore, such performances
are intertwined with technology to the extent that the ex-
pressive medium becomes a technology itself. Making net-
worked music thus requires a diﬀerent approach not only
to performing, but also to designing instruments for such
performances. In this paper, we outline some of the issues
inherent to networked music and describe some of the design
choices we made to address these.
Digital music instruments display a great variety in terms
of their characteristics and functions. As a result, studies
in this ﬁeld focus on a great variety of topics ranging from

the epistemic nature of digital instruments [9] to the in-
teraction methods they utilize [19]. Our relationship with
new instruments continuously evolve alongside the media
through which we are exposed to them. For instance, vir-
tual environments aﬀord a medium for live electronic music
performances, and oﬀer unique ways of interaction [5]. Al-
though the use of virtual spaces for networked performance
dates back to early days of computer networking [2], its
potential reaches new extents with new technologies. Mod-
ern high-speed networks can transmit many types of me-
dia, allowing networked instruments to make use of graph-
ics, video, text as well as sound. For instance, the artist
Atau Tanaka’s work MP3q [18] makes use of a graphical
text interface for a participative music system on the web
browser. The artists Angus Forbes and Kyomitsu Odai’s
interactive multimedia composition Annular Genealogy [7]
is comprised of aural and visual engines that exchange in-
formation between each other over a wireless network. The
network band Glitch Lich [13] builds network performance
instruments, where 3D visualizations are used to improve
the communication with the audience.
Over the last decades, multiplayer games have proven to
be successful venues for stimulating competitive and collab-
orative behavior in networked settings. As a result, we ob-
serve various technical and aesthetic characteristics of com-
puter gaming being inherited by networked instruments [16,
11]. For instance, Chad and Curtis McKinney have devel-
oped a network music engine inspired from video game syn-
chronization systems [12]. Similarly, Rob Hamilton’s q3osc
and UDKOSC are modiﬁed versions of existing game en-
gines dedicated to musical performance within virtual envi-
ronments [8].
Over the past decade, researchers have oﬀered various
categorizations of networked music systems, such as Blaine
and Fels’ collaborative interface contexts [3], and F ¨ollmer’s
three-dimensional net music space [6]. These evaluations
indicate how diverse performances can be in terms of their
level of complexity, interaction types, and network charac-
teristics.
In networked performances, timing, which is a crucial el-
ement of music in general, can become unpredictable due to
technical constraints [15]. This can hinder the sense of co-
presence in a multiplayer performance. The artist ´Alvaro
Barbosa demonstrates how latencies in networked music can
never be completely overcome based on his calculation of the
bidirectional transmission time between two opposite points
on the globe that communicate under perfect conditions (i.e.
data transfer in light speed, unrestricted bandwidth) [1].
Accordingly, we treated network characteristics that may
obstruct traditional performances as a natural constituent,
and we designed our system around these characteristics.
For instance, time delays can be considered as a reverbera-
106
tion of the network infrastructure [18]. Instead of attempt-
ing to deal with the technical bottlenecks of the telecom-
munication system involved in a network performance, we
approached the matter by focusing on the performative and
aesthetic qualities of our audiovisual environment. This can
be described as a virtual site-speciﬁc approach, similar to
how an artist can compose for a speciﬁc concert space.
2. MONAD
Monad is a networked multimedia instrument for electronic
music performance. Users interact with virtual objects in a
3D graphical environment to control sound synthesis. The
visual objects in Monad expand upon the idea of optical
discs with the addition of interactivity, real-time synthesis
parameters, and three dimensional motions. Every virtual
object in a Monad performance is accessible by all partici-
pants rather than being assigned to individual performers.
The objects therefore act less like personal music instru-
ments and more like shared components of a musical col-
laboration.
Monad clients are able to control the timbre, dynam-
ics, ﬁltering, and temporal characteristics of each graphical
sound object. Each player can not only manipulate vari-
ous parameters of the existing objects but add and remove
them. A global Perlin noise function provides gradual ran-
domized movements for each disc in the z-axis. The random
seeds for each disc’s noise generator are determined by the
server so that all clients observe the same randomized move-
ments of the objects.
Non-musical communication between performers is an im-
portant element of a musical collaboration, where perform-
ers can use bodily gestures rather than musical cues to sig-
nal their intents. This type of communication can be lost
in networked music due to the disembodied nature of the
performance. In Monad, we implemented a chat system
to facilitate the communication between players, following
other network ensembles such as Glitch Lich [10]. We uti-
lized this system to study both the eﬀects of non-musical
cues in networked performances and the role of such cues in
the audience’s appreciation of a networked performance.
2.1 Software
The Monad software is designed using the C++ multimedia
toolkit openFrameworks1. For sound synthesis, we use the
openFrameworks addon ofxTonic 2. Furthermore, we im-
plemented the graphical user interface of our system us-
ing the ofxUI addon 3. Users are provided with a binary
ﬁle based on their platforms. The source code of the sys-
tem for the client and server nodes can be downloaded at
http://github.com/occak.
2.2 Interface
The Monad interface, as seen in Fig. 1, oﬀers several mod-
ules. On the top left corner is a UI window, which allows
users to add new grooves, as well as to modify the texture
type, rotation speed, texture density, radius, and z-axis mo-
tion of existing grooves individually. A console beneath this
window reports each user’s actions and the rewards granted
by the server. Next to the UI window is a chat stream
overlay. On the right-hand side of the screen are bars that
display each user’s remaining resources. On the bottom of
the screen, another UI window for global changes allows
the users to toggle or reset the z-axis motion of all objects
globally. A separate button next to these controls allows
1http://www.openframeworks.cc
2http://github.com/TonicAudio/ofxTonic
3https://github.com/rezaali/ofxUI
the users to toggle the visibility of the chat stream. Besides
these visual UI elements, the users can utilize the W, A, S,
D keys on their keyboards to scroll through discs and tex-
ture types. Furthermore, the users can change the camera
perspective with simple click and drag interactions.

mance with 3 collaborators.
2.3 Agency
During the initial evaluation of our system with remote
players, a strong preference for a clear representation of
each user’s presence within the environment was expressed
by the participants. Furthermore, the users noted feeling
dissatisﬁed when their actions were not evident in the au-
diovisual output. This is in line with Tanaka’s ﬁndings on
how users expect an instrument to be responsive and to
give them a clear sense of musical agency [18] within an
ensemble.
We found that a fundamental method of improving agency
is to articulate each player’s identity within the virtual en-
vironment. Furthermore, a user’s presence should be clearly
highlighted to not only themselves but also the other play-
ers, eﬀectively eliminating anonymity in the performance.
In an early prototype, our chat system relied on IP ad-
dresses to label users. While this was suﬃcient to diﬀer-
entiate between the participants of a conversation, it was
described as not being clear enough to keep track of the
identities. A self-assigned nick name was reported to of-
fer a better sense of agency. We also observed that even
when each player is able to pick a unique nickname, they
also announce their real names to the other participants to
reveal their identities. Furthermore, each player’s sense of
presence is reinforced with individual color labels that are
persistent throughout the UI as seen in Fig.1.
2.4 Topology
The topology of a network dictates what is communicated
during transmission, the order in which the communica-
tion happens, and the direction of information ﬂow. For
example, a centralized network takes information from the
players’ input and sends it to a center of activity, where
the data will be analyzed [20]. Decentralized systems, on
the other hand, enable direct interaction between the par-
ticipants but are limited by the computational capacity of
each node. However, Rohrhuber argues that the network
topology alone does not provide a complete representation
of a network music system [14]. The causal topology of a
networked performance becomes an integral aspect of the
audience experience. In other words, solely focusing on the
logical organization of the network cannot fully reﬂect the
107
end product. To investigate the eﬀects of our network topol-
ogy we conducted user evaluations with performers and au-
dience members, which we will discuss in Section 4.
With Monad, we designed a network structure based on
a server-client relationship as illustrated in Fig. 2. All users
are clients with equal privileges, while the server, which
is hosted at one of the performers’ computer, maintains
the shared environment. Upon starting the program, the
users are expected to enter the server’s IP address and their
unique nicknames. In the latest version of our system, up
to 4 clients are able to connect to the server. The server ini-
tially assigns equal amounts of resources to each node and
broadcasts each participant’s details to the others. During
the performance, the server reports the momentary states of
the environment to each participant. Here, the server func-
tions as a shared object that all clients are able to impose
changes on. Furthermore, the server maintains an auto-
mated rewarding system, which we will further describe in
the next section.

vidual clients.
3. MITIGATING NETWORK LATENCY
Given the physical limitations elaborated in the ﬁrst sec-
tion, an absolute temporal uniformity cannot be achieved
in networked music systems. As a result, while transmission
latency can be utilized as a creative component of networked
performances [4], it is nevertheless an inherent component
of such systems. Given the importance of timing in musi-
cal performances, it is essential for a networked instrument
to address the eﬀects of latency so that these do not im-
pede creative ﬂow. We have utilized several techniques, as
descrubed below, to mitigate the eﬀect of latency during a
performance.
3.1 Timbral vs. Temporal Characteristics of
Sound
In Monad’s audiovisual output, the sound synthesis rou-
tines that are mapped to each graphical object are identical
in each client’s node. However, due to network latency, the
phase relationships between individual synthesis modules
can vary from one node to the other. To alleviate the ef-
fects of such temporal non-uniformities across participants,
musical interactions in Monad are designed to focus on tex-
tural qualities of sound. Instead of triggering discrete mu-
sical events, the players initiate looping patterns and then
manipulate the timbral, spectral and dynamic character-
istics of the patterns during the course of a performance.
This maintains that the players are exposed to a musical
structure that is consistent across individual nodes.
3.2 Game Mechanics
Network delays between players pose the risk of disengaging
them from a common musical purpose; in order to increase
cooperation between players and emphasize their together-
ness in a performance, we introduced simple game mechan-
ics to our environment. With this, we aim to elicit cer-
tain behaviours from all participants to improve conscious
interactions during a performance. Diﬀerent from regular
games, the foremost function of the implemented mechanics
in Monad is to facilitate musical interaction without extra-
musical goals. Accordingly, the mechanics are intended
to moderate a musical performance rather than rendering
sound as a byproduct of non-musical interactions. Further-
more, we wanted the mechanics to nurture emergent musi-
cal behavior across participants instead of conﬁning perfor-
mance to a predetermined structure.
An internal economy mediates the performances inMonad.
All clients begin with an equal amount of resources (i.e.
points). Each action carried out during a performance (e.g.
changing synthesis parameters, adding new grooves) costs
the players points. When a user runs out of resources, he or
she is unable to perform any further actions. To manage this
resource system, we tested two diﬀerent rewarding mecha-
nisms based on either a client-driven or a server-driven ap-
proach.
In Monad v0.1, we implemented a client-driven reward
system that relies on players to give each other points if
they “like” the changes performed by other players. Each
player’s most recent actions are displayed as a stream of
buttons on the user’s screen as seen on the left-hand side
of Fig. 3; clicking on these event reports reward points to
the corresponding player. In this system, the clients are
in charge of the rewarding mechanism, thus their decision-
making is critical to the internal economy.
Figure 3: Screenshot from a 4-player performance
with Monad v0.1. The remote players’ actions are
streamed on the left-hand side in the form of color-
labeled buttons which a player can click on to re-
ward these actions.
In Monad v0.2, we developed a server-driven reward sys-
tem that does not depend on players’ approval, but is au-
tomated by the server. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the server
keeps track of all players’ actions and assigns points to play-
ers who make changes that are analogous to those by other
players. This model is inspired from the call-and-response
style often used in improvisatory performances. In the cur-
rent implementation, similarity of actions between partici-
pants are rewarded when these actions are performed within
108
a limited time span (i.e. 10 seconds). As a result, users
are encouraged to pay attention to other performers, and
to promptly respond to their actions in order to retain re-
sources.
3.3 Visual Aesthetics and Crossmodality
In accordance with the focus on timbral qualities of sound
in Monad, we have designed the corresponding virtual ob-
jects in a way that reﬂects the same patterned and looping
characteristics in the visual domain rather than consisting
of sparse visual events. Disc-like shapes seen in Fig. 3 are
used by the players to control the sound output. This de-
sign was inspired from Evgeny Sholpo’s Variophone, which
was a graphical sound system based on optical discs, from
the early 20th century [17].
Furthermore, we particularly focused on the mappings
between auditory and visual features to facilitate perceived
coherence across modalities and to improve the sense of
causality between visual changes performed by the players
and their sonic outputs. In order to secure an audiovisual
unity, all drawing and synthesis operations are handled by
client nodes. Although the server maintains the momentary
global state of the environment, the transmitted informa-
tion consists only of numeric values pertaining to visual co-
ordinates and synthesis parameters, which puts a minimal
strain on the network.
4. EV ALUATION
4.1 Performer Evaluations
In a series of preliminary evaluations, diﬀerent versions of
Monad were tested with a total of 10 users aged between
24 to 32 years. Participants were ﬁrst given a basic ex-
planation on how to use the software. The tutorial was
followed by an exercise performance which was recorded.
The users were then asked to respond to survey questions
with Likert-type ratings (i.e. from 1 to 5), and free-form
verbal responses. Participants rated a set of statements
that determined their background (”I am a musician”, ”I of-
ten play computer/console games”),Monad’s learning curve
(”Getting to learn the program was easy”, ”I felt getting
better as I played”), their relationship with other players
(”Communication with others was easy”, ”I felt competi-
tive against other players”, ”I rewarded players due to their
speciﬁc actions”), and their general experience (”UI con-
trols were practical”, ”The musical output was satisfying”,
”I would like to play it again”).
Results indicated that the participants of this initial sur-
vey were all music performers, and the group consisted pri-
marily of music professionals. But, the users were evenly
divided in terms of their gaming experience: one half rated
their computer gaming experience high, while the other half
asserted that they rarely played video games. Nevertheless,
all participants indicated that learning to use the software
and communicating with others were fairly easy. The results
showed that all participants enjoyed the musical output, felt
that they improved as they played, and would like to play
again. Interestingly, the amount of competitive behavior
observed across the board was lower than we anticipated.
This reﬂected as a collaborative attitude throughout each
performance, where participants called for help when low
on resources and awarded each other points to keep each
other in the game.
Following these initial studies, severalMonad performances
were carried out with 3 to 4 players. Involving more play-
ers in the same environment naturally increased the overall
activity at a given time, which in return impacted the mu-
sical output. During performances with v0.1, which relied
on the client-driven reward mechanism, the sound output
tended to get cacophonous during increased activity. Never-
theless, interesting musical dynamics appeared in such sit-
uations, where users began to rapidly alter the textures on
a groove, causing noticeable changes in timbre. Musically,
such actions resulted in solo-like gestures where other users
displayed a musical inactivity and provided resources to the
’soloist’ to keep them in the game.
The client-driven rewarding system was described by some
of the players as detaching them from the performance,
since they felt they needed to stop interacting with the
graphical objects and press update buttons to reward other
players. Overall, most participants expressed that they used
the rewarding mechanism just to help each other remain in
the game rather than paying attention to individual actions.
Other players did report giving rewards based on perfor-
mance; one user stated that instead of reading the action
labels on the buttons, she pressed them whenever a button
synced with a change in music that she enjoyed.
A major motivation to try other game mechanics was to
address the cacophonic quality of the sound output. We
wanted to motivate players to follow others, which we ex-
pected to result in more uniﬁed structures. Participants
who performed with both versions of the system reported
that the second version which relied on the automated re-
warding system based on similarities felt more intuitive to
perform with. The audio recordings of the performances
with the second version of the system evidenced a more co-
ordinated and balanced collaboration, since the mechanics
led the players to take actions that are similar. This implies
that changing the mechanics of the system has inherently
aﬀected the style of music created with the instrument.
4.2 Audience Evaluations
Two public Monad performances were carried out with the
ﬁrst and second versions of the system. While the ﬁrst per-
formance had 15 viewers, the second concert had 35 audi-
ence members present. Brief surveys were carried out with
the members of the audience after each performance. Simi-
lar to the performer studies, audience survey ﬁrst sought to
determine the music and gaming backgrounds of the par-
ticipants, followed by their experience with electronic mu-
sic concerts and more speciﬁcally networked music perfor-
mances. The survey also included questions regarding the
game mechanics, and lastly the participant’s personal expe-
rience of the performance.
Figure 4: A public performance with Monad v0.2
with local players in Istanbul and remote players
from Vancouver and Berlin.
On a Likert-type scale, the participants mainly reported
having experience with electronic music and networked per-
109
formances, but indicated that they lacked experience with
gaming. A majority of the viewers expressed having en-
joyed the performance and were interested in experiencing
it again.
In both performances, very little information about the
system were disclosed to the audience in advance. The au-
dience members were able to view a projection of one of the
local performers’ screen as seen in Fig. 4. While nearly half
of the survey-takers reported not having noticed the under-
lying game mechanics throughout the performance, the rest
stated that it became noticeable as the performance devel-
oped. Interestingly, the latter group rated the coherence
between sounds and visuals higher than the former group.
One of the participants stated that the disembodied (i.e.
laptop-based) and process-oriented interactions were boring
and non-musical. Other participants have expressed the lo-
cal players could have utilized the physical space more ex-
pressively. Local performers, however, expressed that phys-
ical gestures would go against the democratic nature of the
performance by way of overpowering the role of the remote
players in the audiovisual output.
5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Building upon the study described in this paper, we intend
to explore other game-like rules and their eﬀects on musical
dynamics between the players of a networked performance.
We also plan to extend our user interface to allow for more
complex sonic interactions. Furthermore, to improve the
ease of participation, we are currently porting our system to
a browser-based application, using WebGL and WebAudio.
Besides the issues discussed in this paper, networked mu-
sic can also pose problems in terms of the presentation of
a performance to the audiences in a concert space. We in-
tend to explore how Monad’s game-based interactions can
be communicated to the audiences eﬀectively when most or
all of the performers are in remote locations. For instance,
we plan to evaluate how disclosing information about the
system with varying levels of detail might alter the audi-
ence’s appreciation of a networked performance.
In this paper, we discussed various aspects of networked
music performances that make use of multimedia and vir-
tual environments. Furthermore, we described the meth-
ods we used to mitigate latency issues that are inherent
to such environments. These methods included the uses of
temporal uncertainty as a musical tool, a custom network
topology, and game mechanics. In our user evaluations with
Monad, we concluded that collaborative music-making in
virtual spaces can inherit elements from computer gaming
in terms of interfacing, agency, topology and mechanics to
improve the performers’ sense of active collaboration, and
the audience’s appreciation of the performance.
