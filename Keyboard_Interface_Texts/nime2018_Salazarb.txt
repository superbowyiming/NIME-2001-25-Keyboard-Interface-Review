ABSTRACT
At ﬁrst glance, the practice of musical live coding seems dis-
tanced from the gestures and sense of embodiment common
in musical performance, electronic or otherwise. This work-
shop seeks to explore the extent to which this assertion is
justiﬁed, to re-examine notions of gesture and embodiment
in musical live coding performance, to consider historical
approaches for integrating musical programming and ges-
ture, and to look to the future for new ways of fusing the
two. The workshop will consist ﬁrstly of a critical discussion
of these issues and related literature. This will be followed
by applied practical experiments involving ideas generated
during these discussions. The workshop will conclude with
a recapitulation and examination of these experiments in
the context of previous research and proposed future direc-
tions.

1. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIV ATION
The success of the live coding movement has drawn at-
tention to an apparent tension between electronic music
performance, performative embodiment, and musical ges-
ture. Computer programming, conventionally carried out
in comfortable and relatively isolated environs, may seem
a strange activity to perform on stage in a musical perfor-
mance. Furthermore, the gestures and physical activities
present in many forms of musical performance are typically
absent from live coding performance, or, at least, are not
requisite to the actual production of music.
This workshop seeks to probe this apparent tension, ﬁrstly
questioning whether it really exists at all. Many eﬀorts
evident in the literature and in practice have connected
live coding to more clearly embodied creative practices,
such as performance of gestural electronic musical instru-
ments, acoustic instrumental performance, dance, and pup-
petry. However, interaction with the coding medium itself—

typically a set of text buﬀers—is most often conducted us-
ing a keyboard and mouse, aﬀording limited capabilities for
musical gesture. Of critical import to this workshop is to
consider how gesture and embodiment ﬁgure into the pro-
cess of programming itself in live coding performance.
Secondly, this workshop seeks to re-examine existing deﬁ-
nitions and conceptions of musical gesture and embodiment
with speciﬁc attention to musical live coding performance.
Literature on gesture in electronic music is often focused on
digital musical instruments. Is live coding readily viewed
through this lens, or are additional considerations neces-
sary? Similarly, the literature surrounding live coding dis-
cusses many individual instances of gesture and embodi-
ment in relation to live coding, but to date lacks a general
treatment of these concerns.
Considering historical approaches, participants will dis-
cuss and propose new methods for expanding the role of ges-
ture in live coding music, or extensions to existing systems
for doing so. A lab session will be devoted to rapidly pro-
totyping these ideas. Finally, participants will present their
prototypes alongside their underlying motiviations and dis-
cuss future directions for live coding research and practice.
2. BACKGROUND
As surveyed in [13], evidence of tension between live cod-
ing and gesture can be seen across the literature related to
the former, given many eﬀorts to complement live coding
with more typically embodied creative practices. Collins
describes a number of instances of “bodily explicit live cod-
ing,” including his own explorations of live coding and dance
and live coding of an acoustic improvisation ensemble [3].
Stowell and McLean state that “[a] live coder, like any im-
provising performer, is under pressure to do something in-
teresting in the moment,” and that a programmer’s use of
abstraction and scheduling “can lead to a lack of immedi-
acy in how the performer’s actions relate to the music” [16].
These concerns motivated their commingling of live cod-
ing with “open gesture-based expression,” including collab-
orations with vocalists, thrash guitarists, drummers, banjo
players, and beatboxing. Baalman notes “the physical in-
teraction of our body [...] with the machine” as the pri-
mary instance of embodiment in live coding, in addition
to the development of muscle memory of commonly-typed
programming language syntaxes [2]. Magnusson describes a
live coder as “primarily a composer, writing a score for the
computer to perform” [10], distancing the gestures of typing
musical code from the actual production of sound.
Much as been written regarding the relationship of ges-
ture, embodiment, and electronic music [12, 5], though little
if any speciﬁc treatment of live coding is oﬀered in the litera-
ture. A survey of deﬁnitions of musical gesture by Jensenius
et al. broadly deﬁnes gesture as a “bridge between move-
ment and meaning” [7]. At least one notion of gesture in
386
a computing system rejects the activities associated with
typing on a keyboard [9], though most seem to admit any
physical action linked to a musical result.
3. QUESTIONS AND CHALLENGES
This workshop aims to confront a number of questions and
challenges in existing thought and practical eﬀorts surround-
ing live coding and gesture, detailed in this section. The
workshop will approach these issues both through discus-
sion and through prototyping of practical systems.
3.1 Algorithm and Gesture
Typically, any musical action eﬀected in a live coding per-
formance must be formulated as a series of instructions for
the computer to enact that action, i.e. an algorithm. Con-
sider a musical action such as fading down the volume of
a sound source. To code this, a programmer must decide
if they want a linear or exponential fade out or something
else entirely, and how long in duration the fade out should
span. In some cases, the mathematical formula for the type
of fade out over the speciﬁed duration must be encoded into
an algorithm, if such an algorithm is not built in to e.g. a
system library of the language. This analytical approach
aﬀords a great deal of ﬂexibility in specifying the exact pa-
rameters and timing of the fade out, although this precision
may not be necessary or even desirable in the context of a
musical performance. This process transpires entirely be-
fore any of the resulting sound has actually been eﬀected,
and, once initiated, a musical action encoded in this way
might not be easily canceled or modiﬁed. Overall, for some
musical actions, the advantages of devising an expressive
algorithm many not justify the eﬀort required, especially
in a performance scenario. Furthermore, the length of this
feedback cycle—formation of a musical idea, devising the
corresponding algorithm, evaluating the computer’s result,
and repeat—may impede the exploration of diverse musical
ideas, an integral component of many creative practices [11].
If in this example the sound source’s volume is mapped to
a typical gestural control such as a fader or knob, the process
is somewhat diﬀerent. As a performer adjusts the volume
using the gestural control, they are able to quickly hear
the audible result of their action, and continue or modify
the overall gesture as desired. The translation of musical
intent to audible result is a dynamic feedback loop between
physical action and sonic eﬀect.
This is not an absolute dichotomy: algorithms might be
rapidly enacted within a performance in a gestural manner
and gesture can be used to carry out algorithmic processes.
Some systems, such as Field, Max, and Auraglyph, merge
gestural control within a programming language to varying
degrees. Perhaps it is simply a given of live coding perfor-
mance that creative control be ceded to algorithms that we
might not entirely understand. We are interested in explor-
ing further methods in which these two methods of musical
activity might be integrated in complement with one an-
other.
3.2 Re-examining Text-based Coding Media
Text is arguably the preeminent medium for humans to cre-
ate programming code, and its wide interoperability and
simplicity make it a convenient means for doing so. How-
ever, the entry of linear streams of plain text by standard
keyboard leaves comparatively little room for the use of
gestural tools and techniques common in other forms of
electronic music performance. This workshop seeks to con-
template musical programming systems that have distanced
themselves from plain text, which might then present inter-
esting opportunities for gestural interaction.
Graphical programming languages for music, such as Max,
Pure Data, or Reaktor, are well known in the electronic
music community, though ﬁnd comparatively little use in
live coding circles. Field, Processing’s “Tweak Mode,” and
Codea are text-based programming systems that addition-
ally enable gestural manipulation of syntax elements di-
rectly inline with text code. In Auraglyph, developed by
the ﬁrst author, coding structures are sketched rather than
typed, and further manipulated by touch gestures [14]. These
systems begin to resonate with Victor’s principle of enhanc-
ing the connection of a programmer with the program they
have created; an ultimate consequence of this principle is
the dispensing of the traditional write-compile-run cycle
in exchange for a more immediate and reactive comput-
ing medium [18]. Fusing these ideas with the concepts of
dynamic [8] and tangible [6] media, Victor’s Dynamicland
realizes computing processes in the form of physical objects
that are digitally tracked and projected onto as an individ-
ual interacts with them in the real world. 1
Other researchers have employed very diﬀerent approaches
to the apparent gestural limitations of text programming.
The Stenophone, developed by the second author, is a chorded
keyboard with gestural control of its individual keys, used
as an interface for musical live coding [1]. The CodeKlavier
uses a musical keyboard as an interface for both direct
sound production and entry of textual code into a live cod-
ing environment [17]. The aforementioned systems are pre-
sented here as considerations for further discussion within
the workshop.
3.3 Thinking Outside the Laptop
Other approaches to thinking about embodiment and live
coding have sought intersections between live coding and
other, more typically embodied creative practices. Collins
provides antecedents such as the rule-based systems of John
Cage and Merce Cunningham in dance practice, Jo˜ ao Fi-
adeiro’s employment of real-time composition, and Michael
Klien and Nick Mortimore’s live direction of dancers via
a software interface [3]. Collins’ own work includes a col-
laboration with Matthew Yee-King to perform live-coded
algorithmic dance routines, among other live coding prac-
tices engaging the body. Sicchio has explored the space
of live coding and dance extensively; within a framework
of “Hacking Choreography,” her dance works have used a
score modiﬁed in real-time by its performer, allowed dance
scores to be created by an audience and performed in real-
time, and employed a feedback loop between the score, the
dancer, and live-coded sound [15]. Similar to common mu-
sical practice in live coding, Sicchio projected the code of
her choreographed performances, making the process visi-
ble to the audience; however, the crucial diﬀerence is that
these algorithmic processes were ultimately interpreted by
human dancers rather than by machine musicians. Jense-
nius et al. make a fundamental distinction between “the
gestures of those that produce the sounds (the musicians),
and the gestures of those that perceive the sounds (the lis-
teners or dancers)” [7]; this contrast is readily apparent in
algorave performance, in which live coding is explicitly ori-
ented to the production of music for audience dancing [4].
A symposium dedicated to live coding and the body was re-
cently held, covering live coding in relationship to painting,
choreography, puppetry, mobile devices, and other embod-
ied forms of expression. 2

4.1 Goals
The goal of this workshop is to explore the multifaceted
relationships between live coding, gesture, and embodiment
in musical performance. In particular, we seek to critically
assess the current state of aﬀairs as pertains to live coding
and gesturality, and further propose and evaluate new ideas
for synthesizing the two. We will oﬀer an opportunity for
participants to compare experiences, reﬂect on their own
work, and discuss ways to impart gestural and embodied
interactions in musical live coding.
4.2 Participants
The workshop will be free and open to any interested par-
ties (subject to the usual NIME registration policies). We
expect that some participants will have experience in live
coding or gestural interaction of some form (whether with
a musical instrument or not), though no speciﬁc technical
expertise is required. We would also welcome participants
with experience in practices with a predominant focus on
embodiment such as dance, and researchers and designers
working with gesture.
No submission or pre-registration beyond the usual NIME
registration will be required to attend. Nonetheless, we will
publish information on the workshop online in the months
before the conference and circulate a call for participation,
where interested participants will be encouraged to consider
a particular live coding and embodiment-related issue they
might like to discuss at the workshop.
Participants should bring to the workshop a laptop, which
will be used during the hands-on activity for background
research and rapid prototyping activities. The organizers
will provide additional materials for the design exercise.
4.3 Workshop Schedule
This is a half-day workshop that will divide into three parts
of approximately one hour each. The central activity of the
workshop will be a design exercise centered around gestural
live coding systems, framed on either side by discussion and
evaluation.
4.3.1 Introduction and Discussion
In the ﬁrst 20 minutes, the organisers will brieﬂy introduce
the subject of embodiment as it relates to live coding, sit-
uating it within historical context and examples from the
literature and their own work. This presentation will con-
clude with a series of open questions about the nature of
embodiment and gesture in live coding, motivated by the
discussion included here. The next 40 minutes will feature
open discussion of these questions, inviting personal per-
spectives from the participants. In this short time, we do
not expect to reach ﬁrm conclusions, but we will record
notes for later review and exploration.
4.3.2 Activity
Participants will form small groups to further explore these
ideas. After responding to a series of written prompts from
the organizers, the groups will develop and discuss an origi-
nal proposal for bringing together gesture and live coding, or
for extending an existing mechanism for doing so. They will
then sketch this idea in either digital or physical form, at
their option. This could include a quick sketch in Processing
or Photoshop, or a paper cutout, cardboard construction,
or diagram. The goal is not to produce any sort of opera-
tional tool but to have a quick mockup illustrating the idea
for incorporating gesture into live coding. (Sketches of ex-
isting systems will be provided by the organizers to serve as
examples.)
4.3.3 Evaluation and Review
In the ﬁnal section of the workshop, participants will present
their responses to the prompts and their idea for extending
gesture into live coding of music. Participants will keep a
sheet of paper on which they take notes about their thoughts
with each one. A general discussion will then compare
the qualities of each proposal. From this, we will seek to
draw conclusions about the workshop participants’ collec-
tive perspectives on gesture, embodiment, and musical live
coding. Considerations for future development of the ideas
presented and their dissemination in research literature will
also be discussed.
4.3.4 After the Workshop
Shortly afterwards, documentation of the workshop and a
summarization of the proceedings will be publicly dissemi-
nated via the Embodied Live Coding mailing list 3 and the
webpage for this workshop:
https://embodiedlivecoding.github.io/nime2018-workshop/.
5. FURTHER INFORMATION
