ABSTRACT
This paper presents the reactivation of Soundrise, an inter-
active multimedia application for deaf children, as a case
study to demonstrate the application of time-based me-
dia art preservation and reactivation strategies in NIMEs.
Drawing upon the Multilevel Dynamic Preservation(MDP)
model and the Digital Preservation Object (DPO), struc-
tured frameworks designed to comprehensively document
time-based media art across different levels of information
and iterative processes, this article introduces a novel decision-
making process for reactivating NIMEs, outlined in five
steps: Collection, Assessment, (Re)Design, Implementation,
and Archiving. Through an exploration of the Soundrise
reactivation, the article elaborates on each step of the pro-
posed reactivation process, illustrating the application of
the DPO and MDP model to ensure the preservation of the
application. From the analysis of the previous iterations of
the application, we also provide design reflections on obso-
lescence and longevity. By aligning our work with recent
NIME literature on documentation and reuse, we aim to
offer insights on how to preserve, reuse, maintain and doc-
ument research.

1. INTRODUCTION
The issue of long-term adoption of digital musical instru-
ments in NIME has been frequently discussed [42, 45, 13],
and the need for more research that investigates long-term
engagement with music technology has been highlighted.
The same issue has been explored in the context of time-
based media art for a longer time compared to NIME. There-
fore, in this paper, we studied the possibilities of using
preservation frameworks coming from this field. In par-
ticular, we focus on the Multilevel Dynamic Preservation
(MDP) model and the Digital Preservation Object(DPO)
developed through several publications [5, 21, 19, 20].
In the paper, we will present a case study demonstrating
the practical application of these frameworks outside the
context of time-based media art, but within the research
field. The case study presents the reactivation of Soundrise
- an interactive multimedia application for deaf children.
For this case study, we develop a five-step reactivation pro-
cess that relies on the the MDP model and the DPO. This
process focuses first on evaluating what has been done in
the previous iteration of the artifact and then redesigning
it to account for long-term engagement.
We will illustrate the sequential application of the reacti-
vation process and time-based media art frameworks in the
reactivation of the Soundrise application. Based on the re-
sults and examination of previous iterations of the appli-
cation, we will offer design reflections on obsolescence and
longevity, based on recent NIME literature.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Longevity of NIMEs
The issue of the longevous adoption of digital musical in-
struments has been raised several times in NIME. For in-
stance, the music produced with DMIs is often limited [35]
and tends to fail to survive beyond their initial presentation
[40]. Marques-Borbon and Avila, while discussing longevity,
posit the issue of instruments being maintained only “anec-
dotally or as paper citations” [41]. Morreale and McPher-
son systematically analyzed the work presented at NIME
[45], illustrating that only a small percentage of devices
presented at the conference have been used in many per-
formances. Green criticized the tendency to develop tech-
nical systems instead of developing musicality research [28],
which tended to unbalance the contribution toward the new
interface (NI) and diminish the effort toward new musical
expressions (ME).
In a recent literature review [42], Masu and colleagues
identified some positive approaches to addressing longevity
that have already been implemented by the NIME com-
munity (despite remaining a minority) focusing on the en-
tire proceedings thus addressing both instruments and in-
teractive systems in general. Considering the proceedings of
three years, from 2020 to 2022, they found four commonly
used strategies to sustain NIMEs, determined as:
• Reuse old NIMEsas is, without modification (exam-
ples include [33, 60, 22, 24, 29]);
• Update old NIMEs bymodifying one or more parts to
improve the tools or consider them from a new per-
spective of use (examples include [12, 55, 17, 39, 57]);
• Integrate old NIMEswith new technologies (examples
include [9, 37, 49, 31, 56]);
• Consider long-term engagementwhile introducing new
technologies (examples include [18, 16, 30, 50, 8]);
2.2 Documentation at NIME
Documentation plays a crucial role in ensuring longevity
and replicability [36]. For instance, Calegario and colleagues
also emphasize the importance of documentation and ex-
press concerns about the lack of supporting material in re-
search papers. They argue that most papers lack documen-
tation items and files beyond the paper’s content. Overall
the author highlights the significance of documentation in
supporting replicability: “instruments become available for
users in different locations and cultures and future genera-
tions, enabling more performers, composers, and audiences
to experience artefacts or systems” [11]. In a recent pa-
per, Bin proposed five strategies that can support the doc-
umentation of NIME work in order to promote an articulate
critical discourse in the community [2]. In the paper, she
proposes that documentation should be: Collaborative, On-
going, Flexible, Open, and Complete.
2.3 Time-based media art documentation frame-
works
Problems of documentation and longevity are common in
the context of time-based media art. Artists, curators, prac-
titioners, and researchers have tackled the aforementioned
issues of longevity and proposed theoretical preservation
frameworks by developing original documentation models
[15, 52, 61, 53, 5, 32, 48, 7] studying and proposing practi-
cal reactivation projects [15, 61, 46, 53, 43, 47].
In this context, art preservation can only occur if there is
the necessary information to reactivate the artwork, which
is only possible if each reactivation produces the necessary
information. The term reactivation originates from the con-
cept of activation and implementation in Goodman’s essays
[26, 27], and refers to the actions required to make a work
of art work in front of a spectators. The “re” in front of
activation highlights the field of time-based media art, in
which artworks are viewed as a dynamic system [38]. The
artwork, its degradation, obsolescence, and preservation do
not take place continuously, but rather through different
and separate manifestations. Each manifestation requires
a new activation of the artwork, which will sooner or later
be deactivated. Thus, activation must be repeated (re) to
make the artwork work again. Hence the concept of dy-
namic preservation that emerges as a process in the loop
between documentation and reactivation [21].
Overall, there is a consensus that a documentation model
that allows for recreation should concentrate on more than
just technology but especially on experiences.
As proposed by the Variable Media Network, the documen-
tation of the work should be medium-independent, so that
it can be translated once the current medium is obsolete
[15]. Annet Dekker proposed to document the process and
the experience of the work keeping the memory alive and
accepting a possible loss related to the original medium [14].
Many original models have developed from experience preser-
vation, such as the DOCAM documentation model [52], In-
side Installation’s 2IDM model [61], and Joanna Phillips’
documentation model [48]. The latter proposes a documen-
tation section called “The Identity Report” which specifies
“the intended experience of the piece, outlines its variabil-
ity parameters, and provides guidance for future preserva-
tion”[48].
Focusing on experience, a reactivation process can flexibly
approach technology, reusing pieces of the original technol-
ogy if explicitly required, and leaving space for improve-
ments and upgrades through technology migration [59, 62].
The Multilevel Dynamic Preservation(MDP) model [6, 5,
21, 20] extends the previously mentioned models by propos-
ing a documentation structure defined on different levels of
information and through different iterations of the artwork,
thus considering preservation and reactivation as a dynamic
continuum. As this is the main model we refer to in the work
presented in this paper, we provide here a slightly longer de-
scription.
Any activation of the artwork - including migrations, up-
dates, and changes in technology, performances, and in tech-
nical and artistic instructions - is considered an iteration.
By creating a track of these iterations the model suggests
preserving the artwork as a process of change. The model
suggests archiving each iteration of the artwork as a Digital
Preservation Object (DPO). A DPO includes all the items
that represent that specific manifestation which can be of
three different item typologies: bit are analog and digital
items (hardware and software, installation and performa-
tive objects, fixed-media files like video or audio used in the
manifestation, etc.); data are all that useful information
about the realization of the artwork (score, technical notes,
high-level description of algorithm, instructions, etc.); expe-
rience are any document that bears witness to some aspect
of the artwork (photos, audio-video documentation, inter-
views, experimentation, test, etc.). Furthermore, the MDP
model includes the multiple belongingness property, allow-
ing bit and data to belong in different DPOs. If some (or
even all) parts of the original or previous manifestation are
reused, those will also be registered as elements of the new
DPO (while experience items are designed to gather infor-
mation about the ongoing exhibition and therefore must
belong to a unique DPO) [21]. Figure 1 shows a graphical
representation of the model.
Figure 1: Graphical representation of the Multilevel Dynamic Preservation(MDP) model including the Digital Preser-
vation Objects (DPOs) with their relations as presented in [20].
Although this model is designed in the context of time-
based media art preservation, it can also serve to promote
maintenance and support longevity in other areas, e.g., re-
search projects and multimedia applications. In this paper,
we adopt the model in the reactivation of an interactive
sound application designed to help deaf people. This par-
ticular application was chosen as a case study because of its
simplicity, basic technological interactions, and its ability to
highlight the rich complexity of NIME preservation - NIME
intended here with it’s broader conception of research on
interactive music and multimedia systems [34].
2.4 Original Soundrise
Soundrise is an educational game originally developed by
Centro di Sonologia Computazionale (CSC) in 2012 that
aims to support children in discovering their voices. It is
designed to complement a speech therapy treatment and
to offer an autonomous learning instrument, mainly target-
ing deaf children. The system aimed at allowing them to
explore and acquire a deep understanding of their vocal ca-
pabilities and monitor their progress through the graphical
feedback generated.
Technically, Soundrise is an interactive application that
uses real-time analysis of vocal features providing visual
feedback, thus helping children understand their voice through
a visual representation. The child’s voice is represented by
a sun. The sun moves and changes on the screen accord-
ing to the sound expressed by the child’s voice: it can rise
and fall vertically according to the pitch; it can grow bigger
or smaller depending on the sound intensity; it changes its
color, based on the vocal timbre detected. The recognition
of the last property is related to the identification of the
five vowels of the Italian language: each of the possible five
timbre (as many as the vowels) corresponds to a different
color of the sun.
In 2012, the application was developed through two master
thesis projects at the CSC, carried out by Stefano Giusto
[25] and Marco Randon [51]. In Stefano Giusto’s thesis, the
application was developed using the real-time graphical pro-
gramming environment Pure Data and the external library
timbreID [4] for audio features analysis (Figure 2 shows the
application running in a 2012 computer). In Marco Ran-
don’s thesis, the application was modified to enhance its
portability across different platforms. This new version of
the application was developed in C++ language, using the
libpd library for communication with Pd. The scope was to
improve the graphical interface and adapt the application
to touchscreen devices.
In 2023, the project was resumed in a bachelor’s thesis by
Gabriele Turetta [58], who resumed the application, improv-
ing the graphical interface, and porting it to a web environ-
ment with Javascript and three.js. This thesis project did
not include the development of the audio feature extraction.
The theses developed in 2012 presented relevant evaluations
of the application acquired through two usability tests. The
tests were designed to evaluate the interface and detect
eventual obstacles against the application performance. Ac-
cording to the goal of the application, it was necessary to
verify the correct correspondence of the graphical feedback
with the extracted vocal features.
Both evaluations yielded positive results, especially confirm-
ing the effectiveness of the graphical interface’s simple de-
sign. Some vulnerabilities arose in the representation of the
vowel extraction.
3. REACTIV ATION PROCESS
In 2023, CSC promoted new thesis projects to reactivate
and update the Soundrise application and stimulate fur-
ther research on sound technologies for people with special
hearing needs. The projects yielded significant insights into
the preservation of research activities and products.
In particular, we devised five steps to optimize the im-
pact of a reactivation, that accounts for dynamic preser-
vation, and future reuses. As a practical result, the reacti-
vation of the Soundrise were not only aimed at producing a
cross-platform and better usable application but most im-
portantly at creating a long-term and preservable research
product.
3.1 Five steps to reactivate media and research
projects
In our reactivation, based on existing reactivation strategies
and the MDP model [21] presented above (Section 2.3), we
Figure 2: The original Soundrise running in an 2012 com-
puter.
devised the reactivation of Soundrise in five steps that aim
both at 1) a coherent reactivation, and 2) facilitate future
reactivations by promoting the system longevity. The over-
all process is represented in Figure 3.
1. Collection of the project’s constituent elements at ev-
ery stage of processing (in this case, from 2012 to the
present) to gather as much information as possible and
get a clear overview of the dynamics.
Outcome: a database of one or more DPOs.
2. Assessment of critical issues and vulnerability inherent
in previous versions and prototypes; MDP functions
as an analytical tool to examine the various iterations
and detect improvements and difficulties between each
reactivation.
Outcome: a selection of DPO items usable/unusable.
3. (Re)Designing the new reactivation requires a good
understanding of the previous ones. It aims not only
to solve problems and improve the overall outcome
but also to think about maintenance and long-term
reactivation. A low-level (Re)Design phase should be
structured as Filipe Calegario’s design process [10].
Outcome: A new project that combines DPO items
with reflections on longevity.
4. Implementation means activating the design, perform-
ing a performance, experiencing an installation, and
deploying the application in the case ofSoundrise. Us-
ing Goodman’s words, implementation means “mak-
ing the work work” [26].
Outcome: a new working system.
5. Archiving step covers an important part of the reacti-
vation process. The previous steps produce new docu-
mentation (assets, prototypes, notes, instructions, au-
diovisual recordings, etc) that should be archived fol-
lowing the MDP model structure thus allowing future
reactivations.
Outcome: A (hopefully) more sustainable DPO.
3.2 Five steps in the case study
Below we outline how we implemented the five steps in the
reactivation of Soundrise.
Collection
The first step was to collect the items of the DPOs that can
be analyzed and considered during the reactivation of the
application.
For the Soundrise project, we were able to collect three
DPOs - three versions of the application - that are individ-
ually linked to two master’s theses (related to a first version
in PD and a second in C++) and one bachelor’s thesis (re-
lated to a web version that was not fully completed).
The thesis is a comprehensive document from which we can
extract experience and data items. They include informa-
tion on the design and evaluations (experience), commented
descriptions of DSP algorithms, and mappings for audio-to-
graphical interaction (data).
As an attachment to the thesis, stored in CSC servers, we
had access to the applications and source codes developed
in Pure Data, C++, and JS, representing the bit item. We
organized these materials according to the MDP model (the
three first DPO in the Figure 6) to represent the evolution
of Soundrise over the different versions.
Assessment
All the collected elements were reviewed to identify issues,
vulnerabilities, and strengths of the previous version.
Bit assessment. The previous DPOs present some specific
issues concerning bit’s long-term maintenance and use. The
PD implementation - 1st DPO - requires users to install the
PD software and familiarize themselves with audio settings
which might not be ideal for all scenarios, especially target-
ing children. Furthermore, as mobile computing devices are
becoming increasingly ubiquitous (especially the younger
generation who often have access to personal mobiles but
not always to a personal computer) PD introduces another
barrier as it is not easily compatible with mobiles. The
implementation in C++ - 2nd DPO - requires a constant
update of all the libraries, updating the code to fit the new
OS requirements, and specific compiled versions for the dif-
ferent OS. Additionally, this interface, although it had the
added feature of being suitable for touch-sensitive screens,
was developed in OpenGL (Open Graphics Library). At
present, OpenGL is increasingly being replaced by higher-
performance systems and is no longer used: it cannot be
said to be deprecated, as it is still supported by most plat-
forms (except for Apple machines), it is simply no longer
developed, and therefore is not updated in new technolo-
gies. This aspect represents a big limitation if the goal is
to preserve an application over time. Javascript - 3rd DPO
- would solve the problem mentioned above, but the imple-
mentation choices rendered this specific implementation not
ideal for future improvements: the code implemented only
the graphical part - relying on external software (Blender)
and framework (three.js) - without including the audio anal-
ysis and the user interface.

Implementation, and Archiving
Data assessment. In the case of Soundrise, we identified
two types of data, one related to low-level processes and one
related to the application design.
The low-level data include the description of the various
Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms and are deeply
related to component assessments since they are often elab-
orated on the base of the technologies used. The DSP al-
gorithms implemented in Soundrise were originally deter-
mined by native and external objects in PD. The DSP al-
gorithm for pitch extraction based on the FFT depends on
the fiddle∼ object, while the vowel detection based on mel-
cepstrum coefficients originally relied on the PD’s timbreID
external library. The second DPO implements a porting of
these algorithms using libpd, and the third version de facto
implements only the interfaces, with no changes in the DSP.
The high-level data is represented by the design layer of the
application which include the choices made about the pro-
cesses’ mapping. The link between the audio features and
graphical representation in Figure 4 depends on the devel-
opers’ design and the mapping between vowels and colors
is based on existing literature in assistive technology and
hearing impairments [54].
Figure 4: Audio features to graphical feedback mapping in
Soundrise. An example of data item.
Experience assessment. The theses and a demonstration
video are the only documents we can assess as experience.
From this material, we assess that the graphic design of the
application was particularly simple. The first two theses
also provide the application evaluation through two usabil-
ity tests, which allow for highlighting straights and vulner-
abilities. Results showed that children fully understood the
movement of the sun and the control of the graphic feedback
through the features of one’s voice except for some vulnera-
bilities in timbre. This allows us to conclude that the mini-
mal graphic design of the application facilitates children to
visualize the graphical feedback, while the vowel detection
presents some vulnerabilities.
(Re)Design
Based on the assessment, we defined a set of design possi-
bilities (based on [1], now on we will refer to these possibil-
ities as design space) focusing on the longevity and sustain-
ability of the application. The design space was limited to
web-based technology, considering the future stability, im-
provements, and updating of the application.
Web applications offer accessibility across any device with
a web browser, thereby obviating the requisite for distinct
iterations tailored to diverse platforms, providing intrin-
sic scalability and seamless integration with supplementary
web services. Additionally, the development of web appli-
cations can be on web-sourced libraries, which prevent ob-
solescence and promote longevity compared to proprietary
solutions [3].
We also tailored the development environment towards longevity,
future improvements, and updates, and thus we analyzed
trends in usability and popularity of tools for web devel-
opment. We selected ReactJS 1 as the development envi-
ronment’s front-end framework since it reports the greatest
popularity as shown by the 2022 State of JS2 and the Stack
Overflow Trends service3.
Concerning the DSP algorithms, we decided to diverge
from PD’s objects but rather rely on the audio development
possibilities of the browser, utilizing the Web Audio API4 -
a high-level JavaScript API that enables sound processing
within a Web application. We decided to use Web Audio
as it remained fairly stable over the past 10 years. The new
development environment requires the migration of certain
DSP algorithms. The estimation of audio intensity was im-

plemented using an RMS algorithm (as in the old versions),
while the extraction of voice pitch was implemented with an
auto-correlation algorithm, replacing the FFT-based pitch
extraction implemented in [fiddle∼] object in PD.
We considered three paths for implementing the vowel ex-
traction DSP 1) porting the PD and timbreID system in
Web Audio API, 2) using and adapting APEWORM, an
already existing real-time vowel detection in the browser 5,
and 3) creating a new system suitable for the application.
Applying the first route would have increased the complex-
ity of the application and thus its maintenance since the
PD’s algorithm relies on an audio dataset with which the
input signal is compared. The APEWORM ’s algorithm is
no longer updated (last updated in 2017 as displayed in the
GitHub repository) and appears to be incompatible in many
browsers (it currently works only on Firefox). Considering
the incompatibility and complexity of these previous two
paths, we developed a new system suitable for the appli-
cation. From the maintenance perspective, we decide not
to use external libraries and develop an algorithm with only
Web Audio API’s objects. The algorithm is based onLinear
Predictive Coding (LPC) analysis and formant extraction
which are compared against predefined ranges associated
with distinct vowel sounds.
Concerning interface development, the use of Blender and
Three.js6 was considered. However, to simplify future up-
dates and maintenance, based on the first two DPO eval-
uations (for which the simplicity of the design allows for a
better understanding of the voice’s graphical feedback), we
decided to avoid using external software and libraries. The
interface is completely implemented using ReactJS compo-
nents and CSS animation.
Implementation
After studying all development paths within the defined
design space and producing several prototypes, we finally
achieved an efficient and functioning front-end application
that relies almost exclusively upon ReactJS (a screenshot of
the application in Figure 5). In the implementation phase,
we also focused on the distribution of the web application.
We used the web hosting service provided by Firebase 7
for the application deployment. To promote future im-
provements and developments of both the application and
the related research, we licensed the web application with
the open-source license GNU General Public License v3.0
(GPLv3.0).
Archiving
All the documentation produced in the previous steps of
the reactivation process has been archived according to the
MDP model. We added a fourth DPO, a new iteration of
the Soundrise application (Figure 6)
The MDP model can easily adapt to relational and non-
relational databases, web repositories, and local storage.
In this specific case, we implemented the model through a
GitHub repository. The repository platform also allows the
model to be extended. Version control software (VCS) such
as GitHub keeps track of the project’s history by providing
new layer of controlled dynamicity at the level of archiving

and individual DPO source codes. But it also allows the
project to be simply shared, promoting openness and col-
laboration.
The important point to highlight here, is that we do not only
include the code (which is the component in the DPO), but
we complemented it with links to all the data (descriptions
of the algorithms) and experience (the thesis in se, with all
the information on the design and on the previous evalua-
tion) items as part of the repository.
4. DISCUSSION
Soundrise is a simple interactive music technology that high-
lights key and complex aspects of preservation and longevity
in NIME research. The challenges of obsolescence, tech-
nology migration and adaptation, interactivity, documenta-
tion, and archiving are shared by educational applications
and NIMEs. The case study illustrated the reactivation pro-
cess, including migration to a Web-based application, adap-
tation of DSP algorithms, preservation of original interac-
tivity, and collection of documentation to ensure longevity,
maintenance, and facilitate future improvements.
The idea of reactivating this application for deaf children is
not only to revive its functionality and potential but also
to explore it further and avoid spending time and energy
to start a new project from scratch. While the reactiva-
tion of the application can be considered in itself a contri-
bution, in the scope of this paper we present it as a case
study to show 1) how the Multilevel Dynamic Preservation
(MDP) model and the Digital Preservation Object(DPO)
[21, 20] can serve to reactivate and preserve a research prod-

projects within the context of a real project.
We now discuss our work in light of recent literature on
documentation, reusing, and NIME.
4.1 Documenting NIMEs
As we saw in the background section [11][2], to effectively
preserve technological products and thus increase the lifes-
pan of an artifact, a documentation model and a determined
practice of reuse and updating are needed. This article aims
to present a reactivation process that accounts for docu-
mentation as a pivotal aspect. Recently Bin proposed five
characteristics to effectively document NIME research [2]:
• Collaborative - accurate documentation relies on the
collective input.
• Ongoing record serve as a baseline to assess continuous
developments.
• Flexible - circumstances changes and documentation
needs to be open and adapt.
• Openness - documentation should be accessible and
allow for open contributions.
• Complete - documentation should be checked to en-
sure it represents complete contributions.
Our reactivation model complements this proposal, by show-
ing a way to effectively implement some of these points in
practice.
Ongoing. The MDP model is structured to allow for mainte-
nance and continuous development, recording the dynamic
life of a product through DPOs and their relations. Indeed,
the Assessment and the Archiving that characterize our five
steps, respectively at the beginning and the end of a reac-
tivation, frame the entire reactivation as a step in ongoing
documentation.
Flexible. The model allows for recording all the changes
(migrations, updates, and improvements) in the product
and preserving all its past forms. The DPO provides a re-
searcher with a flexible model where each media artwork or
research product can be analyzed from a different perspec-
tive.
Complete. Again, including an assessment step in a reac-
tivation helps to validate the completeness of a work, and
improve it if necessary. While archiving the work of the pro-
posed case study, we did not only include the code ( bit ac-
cording to the DPO model), but also included links to eval-
uation derived from previous research which impact the aes-
thetics and functionality (experience according to the DPO
model), and the descriptions of the algorithm (data accord-
ing to the DPO model), to easy future porting if needed.
The multilevel structure allows for keeping and organizing
all the documentation on different information levels (verti-
cal structure) and in a timeline (horizontal structure). Col-
laborative and Openness are not directly addressed in the
work we present in this paper since they should concern
archiving, storing, and sharing platforms. We still account
for these points by relying on an open repository 8, which
could arguably foster future collaborations on the project.
4.2 Reactivation and Longevity
This paper aligns with the recent literature on the longevity
of NIME research [40, 45, 41, 42] by proposing a strategy
to actively reactivate and preserve research outcomes and
musical instruments.
Masu and colleagues identified four approaches for a longevity
NIME practice based on the analysis of NIME papers on
updating and reusing [42]. This work offers a way to sys-
tematize such efforts by showing how a model originally de-
veloped for media art (the MDP and the DPO [21, 20]) can
be fruitfully used in the context of NIME research. In par-
ticular, we outline how it can support three of the categories
presented in [42]: reuse, update, and long-term engagement.
The process we presented in this paper facilitates the reuse
(using the terminology by [42]); indeed, by offering a de-
tailed action plan to recreate digital (music) technology it
can facilitate the reuse, even if some specific technical im-
plementations are different.
Our work also shows a thorough process to ease updates
(using the terminology by [42]) of interactive music tech-
nology. Some recent papers [12, 55, 17, 39, 57]) presented
updates of interactive music systems, and sometimes they
actually account for issues of obsolescence and maintenance.
In our work, we move forward on this path by connecting
it to literature from media preservation (which has dealt
with longevity issues for a longer time compared to NIME)
[52, 61, 32, 48, 7, 5]. Indeed, the assessment phase in our
reactivation process is implemented specifically to address
maintenance by retrospectively analyzing the previous evo-
lutions. Additionally, the (Re)Design phase takes into ac-
count future updates.
Our work also aligns with research based on long-term en-
gagements (using the terminology by [42]). Indeed, the
DPO [21, 20] provided us with a model that intrinsically
accounts for the evolution of a system over time. By rely-
ing on this property, in the collection and assessment phases
of our reactivation process we first analyzed and compared
the different versions, highlighting criticisms. This is in it-
self a design contribution that allows for developing new
knowledge from a critical analysis of design decisions that
occurred in different iterations over more than a decade.
4.3 Reactivation and Replicability
In his essay on open source DMIs, Calegario stresses the
importance of documentation as a resource for replicability
of a DMI [11], that consequently facilitate its diffusion and
the accessibility of the knowledge inscribed in the instru-
ment itself. Reactivation also helps to support the longevity
of such a knowledge, but, also implies a re-making process
the copes with obsolescence [21]. As such, it requires a de-
sign phase of some parts that is usually not necessary when
replicating a piece of interactive technology. In this paper,
we formalize this redesign within a structured process of five
steps. In both replication and reactivation, documentation
plays a central role, and for this reason, we suggest using
8https://github.com/CSCPadova/soundrise-prj
the insights proposed in this work in combination with the
points highlighted by Bin [2].
The idea of reactivation comes from media art and usually
aims at displaying of a piece of art in front of an audience
[26, 27]. In this paper, we push this idea step forward, not
focusing on the solely artwork, but on interactive systems
in general, where there is no audience rather active agents
interacting with the systems, and in this sense applying it
to NIME research, as a filed that focuses in interactive mu-
sic systems. We hope that our model, in combination with
replicability principles [10] and documentation [2] can fur-
ther support the longevity and sustainability of knowledge
inscribed in NIMEs.
5. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we described the reactivation of Soundrise,
an interactive multimedia application for deaf children. We
present this work as a case study to outline how media re-
activation strategies - the Multilevel Dynamic Preservation
(MDP) model and the Digital Preservation Object(DPO)
- can be applied to NIMEs. Furthermore, we developed an
original reactivation process composed of five steps: Collec-
tion, Assessment, (Re)Design, Implementation, and Archiv-
ing. Based on the analysis of the previous iterations of
the application, we also offer a number of design reflections
concerning obsolescence and longevity. By discussing our
work in light of recent NIME literature on documentation
and reuse, we hope that our contribution can help other re-
searchers to preserve, reuse, or maintain research outcomes.
6. ETHICAL STANDARDS
This paper complies with the ethical standard of the NIME
conference [44] and does not present a conflict of interest.
The project propose an original strategy for NIMEs reac-
tivation and a case study in which no human or animal
participants were involved.
In addition, this paper directly addresses the preservation
and longevity of NIMEs, addressing pertinent issues essen-
tial to improving understanding of existing digital tools,
promoting self-awareness of what has been done within the
NIME community, and supporting the adoption of sustain-
able practices through innovative strategies.
