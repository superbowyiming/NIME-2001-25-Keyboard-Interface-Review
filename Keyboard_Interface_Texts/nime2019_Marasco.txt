ABSTRACT
Bendit I/O is a system that allows for wireless, networked
performance of circuit-bent devices, giving artists a new
outlet for performing with repurposed technology. In a typ-
ical setup, a user pre-bends a device using the BenditI/O
board as an intermediary, replacing physical switches and
potentiometers with the board’s reed relays, motor driver,
and digital potentiometer signals.
Bendit I/O brings the networking techniques of distributed
music performances to the hardware hacking realm, opening
the door for creative implementation of multiple circuit-bent
devices in audiovisual experiences. Consisting of a Wi-Fi-
enabled I/O board and a Node-based server, the system
provides performers with a variety of interaction and con-
trol possibilities between connected users and hacked de-
vices. Moreover, it is user-friendly, low-cost, and modular,
making it a ﬂexible toolset for artists of diverse experience
levels.

1. INTRODUCTION
Deﬁned as an improvisational approach to exploring elec-
tronics through hardware hacking[5], the practice of cir-
cuit bending has blossomed into a well-studied and highly-
explored art form. As circuit-bending practices evolve into
the 21st century, artists have begun to experiment with new
directions to challenge some of the art form’s inherent lim-
itations.
A desire to enhance the musical and aesthetic practices
of circuit bending with the mediation techniques of dis-
tributed musical performance ﬁelds led us to devise Ben-
dit I/O, a system that embraces the eclectic mixture of po-
tential sound-making devices implored by hardware-hackers
and allows them to augment their hacked instruments with

an intermediary circuit, enabling them for networked perfor-
mance. Furthermore, coupling this new circuit with software-
based solutions would be the key to bringing new and cre-
ative methods of mediated interactivity to the performance
of hacked devices. Just as adding MIDI I/O to the organ
opened the door for local network control and mediation of
an instrument’s physical, mechanical systems, artists can
turn any device into a Smart Musical Instrument by hack-
ing the BenditI/O system into their creative practice. The
system’s I/O board (see Figure 1) and server software al-
low for performing hacked hardware in collaborative and
generative compositions by syncing devices in a number of
network conﬁgurations. The programming interface is ac-
cessible by every device on the network, which means that
Bendit I/O boards can communicate with other BenditI/O
boards, multiple audience members or a single performer
can communicate to any number of BenditI/O boards, and
multimedia elements (visualizations, live data streams, so-
cial media feeds, etc.) can interact with BenditI/O-enabled
devices (see Figure 2).
This paper provides a description of the BenditI/O sys-
tem components, preliminary tests of the system in a perfor-
mance setting, a speed and response test, and examples of
interaction interfaces and applications. We also summarize
related works in the ﬁeld and provide a background on the
practices of circuit bending, networked music performance,
and IoMusT paradigms.1

2. CONTEXT & RELATED WORK
2.1 Circuit Bending as Musical Practice
Numerous studies and books, both educational [3] and theo-
retical [13], have distilled circuit bending as a practice mix-
ing pre-planned preparation and discovery with exploratory
performance. Musically, circuit bending results in the cre-
ation of customized, avant-garde instruments made from
typically non-performative electronic devices. In perfor-
mance, simple physical interactions with these modiﬁed de-
vices (ﬂipping switches, pressing buttons, turning dials, etc.)
generate unpredictable sonic results through real-time mod-
iﬁcation of a device’s internal circuitry. From an aesthetic
perspective, the act of performing with hacked hardware
draws connections to the Upcycling movement—the act of
artistically and practicality repurposing items or materials
into new, more purpose-driven objects—as well as highlight-
ing a nostalgic connection between the audience, performer,
and the device.
Circuit bending ensembles such as Oval2 and Loud Ob-
jects3 often perform with numerous hacked devices simul-
taneously shared between each performer in order to draw
from a wider range of sonic palettes. This increase in the
amount of devices in a performance does provide a road-
block for solo performers, where physical interactions with
multiple devices are limited to what can be enacted with
just two hands. Other artists have begun to experiment
with new methods of interfacing with their creations in or-
der to extend and/or mediate their performative gestures.
Sam Battle (a UK-based artist performing under the moniker
Look Mum No Computer4), adds control-voltage inputs to
his hacked GameBoys and Furbies in order to perform large
quantities of these devices from a modular synthesizer and
a piano keyboard respectively.
2.2 Networked Music Performance & IoMusT
While exploring new directions for performing with circuit-
bent instruments, we looked to the world of networked and
distributed performance systems for inspiration. Networked
music performance (NMP) describes a series of tools that
allow for collaborative music-making among many users on
a shared, telecommunicative network [4]. Recent advances
made to designing audience-performer networking topolo-
gies and data latency issues [6] have provided artists with
new methods of incorporating mediated interaction into their
works.
A related ﬁeld of research known as the Internet of Mu-
sical Things (IoMusT) centers around the addition of aug-
mented and Smart Musical Instruments to the participa-
tory, data-driven performance environment created by NMP
[15]. While NMP technologies allow for a bevy of Internet-
enabled computer devices to be utilized for musical per-
formance, the IoMusT ﬁeld in particular opens the door
for new and unconventional devices to be linked together
through a central server, allowing for collaborative perfor-
mance between disparate devices [14].
2.3 Related Work
Over the past two decades, a handful of hybrid digital and
analog systems have been developed to allow users to in-
teract with hardware. One of the earliest relevant exam-
ples was the ICube System (which later morphed into the
ICube X) by Axel Mulder [10]. Developed in 1995, the
ICube System was designed to give artists an easy means
of digitizing environmental sensor readings into their DSP

dit I/O system.
environments. The devices transferred data through MIDI,
but were primarily designed as input devices, providing min-
imal output capabilities for controlling hardware. In 2004,
Eric Singer developed the MidiTron [12]. The MidiTron al-
lowed for bidirectional MIDI communication for the purpose
of reading sensor data as well as driving voltage-controlled
actuators and motors. Singer’s creation allowed artists to
remotely perform a large array of devices from a single in-
terface and was an early example of a scalable, low-cost
performance framework for hardware.
Some other platforms are related to the BenditI/O sys-
tem due to their mixing of hardware performance and IoMusT
paradigms. The AppiOSC (developed by Lawson, Smith,
and Appio [7]) and the Patchwork system (developed by
Mayton, Dublon, et al. [8]) both allow for web-based control
over modular synthesizers in slightly di↵erent manners. The
AppiOSC generates control voltage signals based on live-
coded data from a browser-based graphics generator while
the Patchwork system doing allows for multi-user networked
control of a massive modular synthesizer through manipu-
lation of graphical dials and switches. Furthermore, the
Orchestra of Things (devised by Stephen Beck and Chris
Branton) explores the use of a central network for connect-
ing multiple SMI’s, mobile devices, and speakers to cre-
ate distributed data streams for ensemble performances [2].
While no circuit building or hardware hacking occurs in any
of these systems, they do present novel means of mediating
the control of physical hardware parameters through local-
ized and networked means.
3. SYSTEM DESIGN
The BenditI/O system consists of three discrete parts: a
Wi-Fi-enabled I/O board (see Figure 1) wired to a hacked
device (see Figure 3), a Node-based web server, and a web-
332
enabled performance interface/data source of the user’s choos-
ing. After picking a device to hack and planning their in-
tended patch points to “bend”, a user connects the Ben-
dit I/O board to these points in lieu of adding physical
switches, buttons, or dials, allowing for networked and re-
mote patching in performance.
Both the hardware and software components of BenditI/O
are designed to be modular and conﬁgurable during perfor-
mance: each board automatically searches for a preset Wi-
Fi network and available server upon powering up, meaning
that new devices can be added and dropped from the net-
work seamlessly. This ﬂexible client/server communication
model for distributed music performance draws inspiration
from frameworks such as NexusHUB [1] and Rhizome [11].
3.1 The Bendit_I/O Board
The BenditI/O board contains an ESP32 microcontroller,
chosen for its on-board ADC/DACs, low power consump-
tion, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios, complex GPIO multi-
plexing abilities, and low price point (circa $6 to $10 USD
for generic development boards). Additional peripherals in-
clude a six-channel digital potentiometer IC (capable of out-
putting 0k⌦ to 100k⌦ acting as either resistance dividers or
a voltage dividers based on the number of ribbon-cable pins
they decide to connect to their circuit-bent device), six reed
relay switches, and a dual-H bridge motor driver. A break-
out area includes buses for DAC, ADC, and 3.3 volt lines
provides users with additional I/O options when designing
their hacked device modiﬁcations. A dedicated 12 to 24 volt
power line is supplied for powering DC motors or solenoids,
which can be used to control the speed and direction of
turntable motors or the press and release of tape machine
read/record heads. All output signals from the board ter-
minate in multi-pin headers or screw terminal connectors.
Using ribbon cables, users can disconnect one hacked device
from their board and swap it out for a di↵erent one without
needing to restart or reprogram the hardware. An example
of connecting the board to a hacked device can be seen in
Figure 3.
3.2 The Server
The BenditI/O Server works as an intermediary connec-
tion between web-enabled performance interfaces and any
Bendit I/O-enabled hacked devices. Performers can choose
to host the server locally on their machine or remotely for
globally-connected performances. When a new BenditI/O
board connects, the server collects the unique socket ID and
MAC address and stores it into an array. It then replaces
this ID with a nickname (which can be displayed in the
user’s performance interface) and device color (displayed
with the on-board LED), allowing for visual identiﬁcation
during performance. If the user is playing with a large num-
ber of circuit-bent devices, the server code provides the abil-
ity to group board ID’s into smaller subgroups, giving them
the ability to enact a particular bend only on the devices
in a subgroup, while executing di↵erent control commands
over the rest of the ensemble. This is helpful when perform-
ing with a mixed collection of hacked devices, providing the
performer the ability to communicate with their devices as
if they were separate sections of an orchestra.
3.3 Interfacing with Bendit_I/O
The server supports bidirectional messaging through socket.io.
Any internet-enabled device, software, or custom-made web
app that can format messages accordingly can serve as a
means of communicating with devices on the network. Ex-
amples include web-based interfaces (e.g. web pages, so-
cial network/data API’s, Node-Red), MaxMSP, PureData,
SuperCollider, and other microcontrollers or microproces-
sors (e.g. BeagleBone Black, Raspberry Pi, Particle Argon,
etc.). The server responds to OSC-style messaging schemes
with a focus on keeping the syntax streamlined and easy
to format. Each message must begin by addressing the
assigned device number or subgroup name of the desired
BendIt board (ex:device/1/). The rest of the message ad-
dresses the speciﬁc switch, pot channel, or motor channel to
be activated, followed by a speciﬁc action and value. Table
1 shows a sample of common messages and resulting actions
for performing devices attached to BenditI/O boards. A
complete list can be found in the user guide.

dit I/O boards

4. PERFORMANCE APPLICATIONS
There are a wide variety of performance applications for the
Bendit I/O system. A connected web-client could monitor
social media feeds or changing weather data, route that data
to the server, and trigger bend events on an ensemble of de-
vices. Live performers experimenting with the board’s DAC
outputs could create on-board LFO generators and control
voltage outputs useful for interacting with toy keyboards or
tabletop synthesizers. These additional outputs could also
be useful for hacking the optical pickup unit on portable
CD players or the processing chips on video equipment, al-
lowing for more complex datamoshing in live performance.
Signals from points on a hacked device can also be “sni↵ed”
and sampled into the microcontroller’s memory through the
ADC inputs. In performance, users can store these signals
into a bu↵er and replicate them as method of modifying a
digital potentiometer channel, creating local (between the
circuit-bent device and its attached I/O board) and/or net-
worked (device-device, data source-device, etc.) performa-
tive feedback loops.
5. LATENCY TESTING
We ran a test with a single BenditI/O board and a single
performer-device sending commands to the board via a web-
page interface. Both devices were connected to the system
server through a closed Wi-Fi network, broadcasted on a
Linksys E2500’s 2.4 GHz band. On a separate computer,
an audio ﬁle was recorded into a DAW, and a switch output
from the BenditI/O board was used to connect and break
the audio signal remotely. For reference, a second audio
track was used to record the sound of a mouse click on each
mouse-up event. This allowed logging of the amount of time
between triggering the toggle state from a mouse-up event
and the mechanical switching of the board’s relays.
The results of the test found that out of 21 toggle events,
the average latency time between message and switch event
was 87 milliseconds, with the fastest time logged at 33 mil-
liseconds and the slowest time at 121 milliseconds. This
means there was a signiﬁcant amount of jitter – the stan-
dard deviation of the samples was 25 milliseconds when es-
timated using thestd function in Octave. This latency

could be due to a variety of sources. Notably, the Wi-Fi
network is likely to be contributing signiﬁcantly to the la-
tency. To match or exceed these results in performance, we
recommend connecting all devices to a single, closed Wi-Fi
network and to take necessary steps to set-up the most ro-
bust wireless environment possible based on recent research
for optimal music performance Wi-Fi practices [9].
6. FUTURE WORK & CONCLUSIONS
In future performances, the ﬁrst author is planning to use
the BenditI/O system to bend a wide variety of systems
simultaneously in his upcoming performances and instal-
lations. The emphasis will be on connecting digital and
Internet-based systems with classical circuit-bent hardware,
to situate these kinds of works in a new light and adapt
them for the 21st century. Future projects will also ex-
pand the number of simultaneously-connected BenditI/O
boards through the same Wi-Fi network to realize ensem-
bles of circuit-bent devices and evaluate the network be-
havior. Latency will need to be reduced for precise, per-
cussive performances; however, the system should operate
fast enough for a very wide variety of kinds of experimen-
tal music practice, including interfacing traditional circuit
bending approaches with modern networked systems.
Bendit I/O brings together the DIY, lo-ﬁ aesthetics of cir-
cuit bending and the networked complexities of distributed
music paradigms. The system provides a low cost, user-
friendly means of interacting with hacked devices for artistic
means, and it allows hardware hackers and digital artists to
work together in collaborative performances. It is our hope
that this new hybrid system provides artists with a new
outlet for experimenting with hacked devices in new and
large-scale artistic ventures now and into the future.
