ABSTRACT
In this paper, we reflect on the focus of “newness” in NIME
research and practice and argue that there is a missing O
(for “Old”) in framing our academic discourse. A system-
atic review of the last year’s conference proceedings reveals
that most papers do, indeed, present new instruments, in-
terfaces, or pieces of technology. Comparably few papers
focus on the prolongation of existing NIMEs. Our meta-
analysis identifies four main categories from these papers:
(1) reuse, (2) update, (3) complement, and (4) long-term
engagement. We discuss how focusing more on these four
types of NIME development and engagement can be seen
as an approach to increase sustainability.

1. INTRODUCTION
The “NIME” acronym has been dissected throughout the
years as an onto-epistemological endeavour to make sense
of who we are, what we do, and what we consider worth
and not worth investigating. The first of these endeavours
was dedicated to analysing the “E”: what is expression for
NIME [24]? In recent years, the“M”was subject to a similar
investigation: what is music for NIME [71]? Despite not
being included in the title of their manuscript, Marquez-
Borbon and Stapleton [64] reflected upon the “N” in their
commentary to the re-edition of their NIME 2014 paper in
A NIME Reader :
“The “N” in NIME itself is perhaps partially to
blame, in that it resists the long-term develop-

ment of performance pedagogies, repertoire and
critical discourse necessary for the legitimisation
of a performance community within the wider
NIME community.” [64]
In this paper, we elaborate on some challenges of focusing
on newness—or novelty, depending on how one interprets
the “N”—in the NIME community. This reflection is rooted
in the observation that relatively little attention is given to
old NIMEs [76].
Reviewing papers from the last three editions of the NIME
conference, we found that most presented papers focus on
new technologies; only a small set of papers accounted for
the longevity of NIMEs. By analysing these papers in depth,
we identified four strategies for prolonging the life of exist-
ing NIMEs: (1) reuse, (2) update, (3) complement, and (4)
long-term engagement. By connecting these strategies with
the life cycles of a musical artefact as articulated by Masu
and colleagues [67] ( Making—Testing—Using—Disposing),
we develop some reflections on sustainability from an envi-
ronmental perspective—based on the relationship between
longevity and waste [18, 43]—and concerning the practices
and the knowledge embedded into these practices connect-
ing it to the idea of sustainability of the results [79].
Additionally, we reflect on an epistemological perspective
related to newness, focusing on the knowledge learned from
existing—Old—NIMEs. This point touches upon what Cantrell
[16] discussed in 2017:
“The positioning of the artistic gesture within
the context of NIME culture immediately poses
specificities and limitations. Perhaps the most
immediate and obvious is the presence of the
‘new’ demarcation. Similar to other monikers
such as ‘new media’, the presence of a tempo-
ral qualifier points to an apriori limitation; that
which is considered ‘old’ is to be excluded. In
other words, the ‘newness’ here is technical, and
the technical is prioritized.” [16]
This paper is structured as follows. The next section ex-
plores NIME’s genesis, longevity, and sustainability issues.
The successive section focuses on our original investigation
into the presence (or absence) of old NIMEs, which is then
discussed with a focus on the ideology of newness and sus-
tainability.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 What is in the name—NIME
The NIME conference began as a workshop at the ACM
Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)
in 2001 and has been organised annually as a separate con-
ference since 2002. Today, it is an important meeting point
for researchers, developers, designers, and artists. The acronym
of the conference—NIME—has an official definition, although
it is not apparent why exactly “new”, “interfaces”, and “mu-
sical expression” were chosen as the defining terms of what
has grown into a large international community.
In A NIME Reader , Jensenius and Lyons [51] suggested
alternative interpretations of the acronym. What if the “N”
would stand for novel, the “I” for instrument, the “M” for
multimedia, and the“E”for exploration? Would that change
the content and discourse of the conference?
The focus on newness in the NIME community can be
seen as a reaction towards a relatively conservative com-
mercial music technology industry. The large producers of
electronically-based instruments have focused for decades
on MIDI-based keyboard instruments. New features are
continuously added, but the basic concepts remain the same.
Even though there has always been innovation in musi-
cal instrument design, there appears to be stagnation in
standardised instruments. Magnusson argued that “[m]ost
acoustic instruments gained their final form in the late nine-
teenth century and have evolved very little since” [60]. Per-
haps caused by this stagnation in the commercial industry,
the NIME community has focused so much on newness that
it effectively prevents long-term development.
Another challenge with the NIME acronym is that it fo-
cuses on “interface” instead of “instrument”. Although it
was probably not intended as such, this terminology effec-
tively removes the focus on (audible) sound and highlights
the technical meeting point between the performer and the
“device”. This creates what Jensenius calls a large action–
sound separation [50]. Many digital musical instruments
are, in fact, not instruments at all if one considers an instru-
ment a “sound maker”. The modularisation of music tech-
nologies has led to the design of separate controllers, sound
engines, and speakers that can be connected in various con-
stellations. This separation arguably focuses on developing
new components rather than long-term musical engagement
with an instrument.
2.2 Longevity and Techno-centrism at NIME
The NIME community is central in developing and exploit-
ing the flexibility of today’s modularised music technologies.
However, combined with the focus on newness, this comes
at a cost. Matters of instrument longevity have been di-
rectly and indirectly discussed at NIME. In 2017, springing
from previous criticisms about the lack of music made with
NIMEs [52] and the lack of NIMEs that remain in use af-
ter being presented at the conference [63], Morreale and
McPherson systematically tested the status of instruments
presented at five successive editions of NIME [76]. Their
results confirmed that more than half are no longer in use,
and a strikingly low percentage have been commonly used
in performances. The authors also commented that it might
not be an expectation for NIMEs to sustain continued use.
Goudard expanded upon this idea questioning whether the
lack of longevity should be considered an issue at all [36].
We should wonder, however, if the ephemerality of NIME is
less poetic and more problematic than it seems. A fast suc-
cession of new interfaces might derive from a characteristic
of the NIME community, as identified by Green: the de-
velopment of technical systems takes priority over research
in musicality [37]. This comment resonates with the early
alarm bell raised by Michel Waisvisz: “If our goal is musi-
cal expression we have to move beyond designing technical
systems”. [90].
2.3 Longevity and Sustainability
Many forms of sustainability exist 1. In this paper, we ac-
count for environmental sustainability and sustainability of
the knowledge embedded in a DMI (which we refer to as of
the results) as more directly connected to longevity.
While the issue of disposal has been touched in relation to
the end of life of DMIs in previous NIME papers [67, 25], an
unquestioned logic of novelty and innovation has an often
under-scrutinised impact on environmental sustainability:
“The drive for novelty at NIME often ends up ex-
plicitly promoting cutting-edge technologies (such
as maker processes, high performance comput-
ing, machine learning) whose wide-scale environ-
mental impact is largely unknown and not yet
discussed” [73]
In 2005, Chapman reported that “over 90 per cent of
the resources taken out of the ground today become waste
within only three months” [18]. Since then, many authors
have investigated the longevity of tools as a way to promote
environmental sustainability and contrast waste production
(e.g. [17, 43, 45]). In a commentary on sustainable inter-
action design, Blevis [4] focused on the possibilities for re-
ducing waste. The author discussed ten actions to rank the
environmental impact of the residual components of tech-
nology, which ranged from Disposal to Active repair of mis-
use; promoting the reuse of the tools in relation to their
longevity is identified as a crucial principle for sustainabil-
ity.
Since then, the interaction design debate on sustainabil-
ity has largely evolved (e.g. [23, 40]). Within this context,
Dourish [26] proposed that sustainability should not be ad-
dressed in terms of individual choices, and cultural contexts
should always be considered. In the last few years, several
authors aligned with Dourish’s view (e.g. [40, 55, 82]) point-
ing out the need of broadening the vision of sustainability
by accounting for a socio-economic perspective. Following a
similar view, Chapman [18] addressed unsustainable waste
production in relation to a social and relational issue. In
his reflection, the author analysed how the waste of prod-
ucts is often symptomatic of a failed emotional relationship
between humans and objects and attributed this failure to
consumerism. According to the author, people tend to en-
gage in short relationships by continuously producing new
objects and swiftly disposing of them.
Bettega and colleagues [3] recently discussed how building
Participatory Design projects around adopting off-the-shelf
digital commons (e.g. open source tools), rather than pro-
ducing new technologies, can offer a valid set of strategies
to promote sustainability while maximising the benefits for
the participants. Indeed, as such tools exist beyond the
scope of a specific project, it is more probable that they
will be maintained beyond the project time frame [2]. The
issue of how to preserve the benefit of a specific project for
the community is a common concern in the Participatory
Design community, and Poderi [79] formalised it as the sus-
tainability of the results .
1This clearly emerges in the Sustainable Development Goal
proposed by the UN: https://sdgs.un.org/
Within the NIME community, the research practice is
generally different from the Participatory Design commu-
nity. Thus the idea of sustainability of the results as for-
malised in [79] cannot be directly applied to our commu-
nity. However, the sustainability of our results and prac-
tices should be a concern. In many cases, DMIs embed a
new form of knowledge in relation to music practice and
experience [60]. As such, we can consider NIME results to
be—at least partially—embedded in our instruments and
related to their musical usage.
Overall, the longevity of an instrument concerns differ-
ent types of sustainability: of the results , by prolonging
and putting into practice the embedded knowledge on an
instrument, and environmental, by postponing the time of
disposal. In this paper, we focus on what is presented at
the conference investigating how the “N” in NIME has been
balanced among longevity, practice, and sustainability in its
various conceptions.
3. OLD NIMES
To better frame longevity, sustainability, and newness-related
issues within the NIME discourse, we systematically scru-
tinised the last three conference editions (2020-2021-2022).
The purpose of this investigation is twofold:
1. To present an overview of the number of new tech-
nologies for comparative purposes
2. To discover and highlight existing strategies for sus-
tainable NIME practice
3.1 Methodology
We systematically analysed all the abstracts of every pa-
per presented at the 2020, 2021, and 2022 editions of the
NIME conference. The analysis featured two stages. The
first quantitative analysis focused on our primary objective
and aimed to provide an overview of new technologies pre-
sented in the past three years. The second qualitative anal-
ysis focused on the second objective by highlighting good
strategies for sustaining NIMEs’ longevity.
In the first phase, we read all the abstracts and manually
annotated them, focusing on whether or notthe paper is pre-
senting a new NIME/technology. For each paper presenting
new technology, we also highlighted whether the new NIME
has a name. The descriptive statistics resulting from this
initial quantitative analysis are presented in subsection 3.2,
and the numeric results are in Table 1.
While scrutinising all the abstracts, we also highlighted
papers that presented a new technology with some form
of long-term engagement with a NIME (e.g. multiple per-
formances or based on previous NIMEs) and papers that
use existing NIMEs for new performances or studies. By
analysing the abstracts, we initially identified 32 papers
that suggested some form of a long engagement. These
papers were further analysed at full length in the second
qualitative phase. In this process, five papers (three from
2021 and two from 2020) were excluded because only one
composition or performance was mentioned. We, therefore,
ended up with a total of 27 papers analysed in the second
phase. The numbers presented in Table 2 already account
for this exclusion.
After analysing these papers, we summarised their rela-
tion with either long-term engagement or previous NIMEs.
Then we coded and recursively clustered them until we iden-
tified the four categories: (1) reuse, (2) update, (3) comple-
ment, and (4) long-term engagement.
3.2 New Technologies
By counting the papers presenting new technologies against
the totality of accepted papers (summarised in Table 1), we
find that the majority (around 67%) of the contributions
presented new technologies. We also observe that this per-
centage is stably above 50% across the three editions of the
conference (minimum 58%, maximum 73%).
3.3 Strategies for Sustaining NIMEs Longevity
In the following, we discuss four strategies for long-term
engagements with NIMEs (see Table 2 for an overview).
3.3.1 Reusing Old NIMEs
Seven papers focused on reusing existing NIMEs as they
are—without any modification. This first corpus of papers
proposes new research using previously developed NIMEs.
These NIMEs have often been used as probes for new re-
search. For instance, Guidi and McPherson [38] presented
a new study using the Magpick (an augmented guitar pick
[75]) to evaluate whether a musician is capable of perform-
ing precise actions on an unfamiliar interface while main-
taining the focus on the musical outcome. As another ex-
ample, Ford et al. [33] examined the types of interactions
emerging with Codetta (creativity support tool for children
presented in [34]), collecting new logs from 20 children.
Two papers focus on reusing an existing NIME, viewing
this from a design perspective. Holzer et al. [46] described
a workshop where sound designers were invited to explore a
historical instrument’s electronic sound (the Dataton Sys-
tem 3000, used primarily in the 1970s). Jack and colleagues
[48] used the instrument Strummi (which was initially pre-
sented by Harrison and Jack [42, 49]) as a case study to
discuss how a DMI can be framed as a research product.
The remaining three papers used an existing NIME, the
T-stick, which was originally presented at NIME in 2007
[62]. Two of them [91, 92] presented a study for remapping
gestural/audio control options of the instrument. One of
these papers [91] purposely replicated the methodology of
the other study and provided the software for future repli-
cation. Finally, the last paper [35] presented a series of
musical commissions supporting composers by organising
workshops and technical mentorship sessions, “meant to fo-
ment composition and performance using the T-stick and
provide an opportunity to improve technical and pedagogi-
cal support for the instrument.”
3.3.2 Updating Old NIMEs
Eight papers presented updated versions of existing NIMEs.
Two papers, which presented the second versions of the Air-
Sticks and AI-terity, primarily focus on technological as-
pects. The AirSticks 2.0 [88] is a new version of AirSticks
1.0 [47], which relied on off-the-shelf virtual reality con-
trollers “which were discontinued one year into the project.”
The AirSticks 1.0 was adopted outside the lab through hun-
dreds of music performances since. The new version com-
bined sensor fusion of Inertial Measurement Units with low
latency wireless data transmission over Bluetooth Low En-
ergy. AI-terity 2.0 [85] improved the AI-terity [84] by im-
plementing a new deep learning architecture and improving
the 3D model of the interface.
Two papers [83, 94] presented a redesign of existing NIMEs
with a design-research focus. Sullivan et al. [83] presented a
user-driven redesign of the DMI Noiseboxes; in this case, the
main focus is on the user-driven process. Zayas-Gari and
colleagues [94] reflected on DMI apprenticeship by develop-

ing a process that led to successfully replicating Strummi
(based on the original instrument [42, 49]).
A few other projects were primarily grounded in personal
practices and uses. Click::RAND 2:0 [29] is a reconceptu-
alisation and redevelopment of Click::RAND, presented in
2020 [28]. The new Electrumpet presented in 2021 [58] de-
scribed major developments since its creation in 2008-9 [56]
and its upgraded version presented in 2012 [57]. In this
case, the paper presented a very long engagement with sys-
tems since the previous version. The new version of the
Feral Cello [21] revisited the performance system that was
first presented at NIME 2017 [20]. This new version was
presented “after an extended development period that has
also encompassed a body of performance.”
Finally, Calegario [13] presented an update of the Proba-
tio toolkit, which was originally presented at NIME 2017
[14]. After that, several musicians interacted with the sys-
tem, and feedback was collected.
3.3.3 Complementing Old NIMEs
The third category includes six papers that presented com-
pletely new technologies that complement or are directly
inspired by existing NIMEs.
An example is a new belt respiration sensor [86] that
was used along with a modified version of the web appli-
cation called Pink Trombone2, created by Thapen in 2017.
Another of these instruments is the Kanchay Yupana [12],
an open-source NIME for the generation of rhythms that
complements Electronic Khipu (a previous DMI based on
an Andean khipu not published in NIME). Pitkin [78] pre-
sented a software emulation of the Magnetic Resonator Pi-
ano [68]. This virtual version was designed for practising
when the physical DMI is unavailable.
Two papers presented new technologies that can be used
in combination with the T-stick. The T-Tree [53], for in-
stance, is a DMI and a docking station that can embed
several T-sticks, expanding on the premise of the original
T-stick and mitigating technical obsolescence (i.e., by sup-
porting updates). TorqueTuner [54] is a module that allows
designers to map sensors to parameters of haptic effects,
that was integrated into an existing T-stick (as well as a
stand-alone knob) to increase modularity and portability.
Finally, one study presented a new surface-based instru-
ment, the Monet [9], and compared it with a previous one,
Locus [81]. Although a comparison of a new technology
against existing literature is commonly found in NIME pub-
lications, this paper is a unique case as it was the only paper
in our corpus that indicated in the abstract a comparison
with another specific NIME.
3.3.4 Considering long-term engagement
While presenting new technologies, six papers described a
long-term engagement from different perspectives. In this
category, some papers described a long practice with them.
For instance, Fiebrink and Sonami [32] described the re-
finement process of the Spring Spyre instrument over eight
years. Bukvic [7] presented Tweeter L2Ork, an online musi-
2https://dood.al/pinktrombone/
cal instrument introduced in April 2020 to ensure the oper-
ation of Virginia Tech’s Linux Laptop Orchestra (L2Ork)—
an ensemble active since 2010 [8])—during the COVID-19
pandemic. Tweeter L2Ork was used in six international
performances during a time span of 18 months. Similarly,
Villica˜ na-Shaw and colleagues [27] presented a fist-sized,
battery-powered, environmentally aware soundscape aug-
mentation artefact used in multiple installations between
October 2019 and March 2020. Dublon and Liu [89] pre-
sented a system initially used online, then used on-site fol-
lowing a festival commission.
In other cases, a prolonged experience constitutes the
foundation of a paper presenting a new NIME. This is the
case of HAGS [80], an augmented saxophone whose design
“was largely justified by some of the repertoire that moti-
vated it, including contemporary repertoire for saxophone
and electronics.”
Finally, Harlow and colleagues [41] presented a pilot study
carried out by a quartet of performers in January 2021. The
initial phase of the project, 2020–22, explored the artistic
and technological affordances of Global Hyperorgan through
a series of interaction scenarios.

4. DISCUSSION
Our systematic analysis confirmed what others have sug-
gested before [16, 76]: the locus of newness at NIME firmly
sits within new designs of new technologies. While we found
a disproportionate amount of papers presenting new tech-
nologies, we successfully found examples of research on and
with old NIMEs (the “O”) in a relatively small but precious
set of papers. In this section, we will reflect on what this
means for NIME.
4.1 The Ideology of Newness
The NIME community has increasingly questioned hege-
monic positions around innovation and techno solutionism
[64, 73, 77] and has suggested a change of direction that pri-
orities musicality over technicality [37]. Our analysis, how-
ever, suggests that newness still prevails in NIME research
practice.
The lack of extensive engagement with “the old” in the
community might be caused by an ideology of newness that
permeates the political-economical system in which NIME
is situated. Previous research by critical music technology
scholars helps us identify some traits of this ideology:
1. an “accelerated temporal logic of contemporary elec-
tronics [...] that insists on newness” [22]
2. a techno-utopian climate marked by“liberation through
new technologies (that) mistakenly places technology,
and not human agency, at the source of human history-
making” [10]
3. a general academic climate that “privilege innovation
and impact over actual content and substance” [64]
and in which “counting matters” [44]
4. a techno-cultural hegemony “rooted in the way (mu-
sic) software is made, and those who make it” [77]
5. a simplistic solution that reduces a complex space of
“personally and artistically motivated challenges” [73],
and of “politically negotiated demands” [11] to neolib-
eral convenience.
We believe that avoiding “sleepwalking into technological
futures” [19] is imperative for NIME. As a progressive com-
munity uniting artists, researchers, and practitioners from
many disciplines, the NIME community could assist in mov-
ing beyond what Ekbia and Nardi called the “simple utility
and beneficence of technology, and (the) uncritical celebra-
tion of innovation” [30].
In NIME research and practice, new knowledge is often
embedded in technology [60], as such innovation requires an
injection into practice in order to develop and preserve the
knowledge inscribed in the instruments. If we look at this
from the perspective of academic advancement, in many
cases, long-term results of NIME research could be identi-
fied in such a practice. Therefore, it is important for our
community to develop strategies to prolong their lifespan
and not only chase novelty to foster a sustainability of the
results [79].
4.2 NIMEs’ Life Cycles and Sustainability
When discussing the sustainability of NIMEs, Masu and
colleagues [67] articulated the life cycles of a musical arte-
fact into four phases: Making—Testing—Using—Disposing.
Cannon and Favilla proposed the concept of “disposable in-
struments” to criticise the culture behind DMIs that are
discarded shortly after their development [15]. We argue
that postponing the disposing of stage is fundamental for
reducing environmental impact by spreading the environ-
mental cost of developing a NIME over a longer period and
promoting its longevity [17, 18, 43, 45].
Prolonging the disposal date of a NIME could also en-
courage more and longer actual practice and use. Reusing
old NIMEs represents an ideal scenario as it prolongs the
Testing—Using phase by reusing the instrument in new re-
search and artistic practice. This is an ideal way of achiev-
ing environmental sustainability [4]; by being used, the in-
strument is sustained by the research practice itself.
A discussion on updating Old NIMEs could be separated
into two parts. Some systems are updated because of tech-
nical needs. This may not be ideal in postponing the dis-
posal of the previous physical or software components. For
instance, as the first version of the AirSticks [88] relied on
a discontinued controller, it is likely that that first version
needed to be disposed of. However, by updating it, the
results and the practice—and the knowledge embedded in
it—are preserved, opening new Testing—Using phases. In
this case, only some parts of the instrument are disposed of,
but not the underlying ideas. A different reflection needs
to be made for those instruments that were updated within
the context of artistic practice and long-term engagement
(e.g. [58, 21]). In this case, an update is an actual form
of use. While discussing the Feral Cello [21], Devis and
Reid clearly frame their long engagement—which leads to
an update on the instrument—as a practice that criticises
short-term engagement.
Complementing old NIMEsrepresents another way of post-
poning disposal. Similarly to reusing old NIMEs, this cate-
gory prolongs theTesting—Using phases of previous NIMEs.
In this sense, these artefacts can promote“renewal & reuse,”
using a terminology by Blevis [4]. However, it consumes
more compared to simply reusing an original NIME, as it
requires developing new technology.
Finally, long-term engagement has virtually no implica-
tion on the life span of previous old NIMEs, but facili-
tates that new NIMEs can grow old. In some cases, the
NIMEs are already “old” when they are presented, such as
the Spring Spyre instrument [32], which underwent a refine-
ment process over eight years before being presented. This
category shared similarity with those systems that present
an update of a NIME after long-term engagements (e.g. [58,
21]). These types of papers present a practice that embeds
a form of sustainability inscribed into artistic practice.
Chapman [18] suggested that waste of a product is often
symptomatic of a failed emotional relationship between hu-
mans and objects, which rapidly induce people to dispose
of technology. Among the four categories we identified, it is
relevant to highlight that three of them present new tech-
nologies. Since NIME is primarily a community of makers,
it is not surprising that one way of promoting long-term en-
gagement is actually building new updated versions or new
instruments to be used in combination with the old ones.
The need for customising technology is probably a neces-
sity to develop emotional engagements with technologies
[18]. This can again lead to continuous updates for mul-
tiple years, either presented as updated instruments (e.g.
Electrumpet [58] or the Feral Cello [21]) or as a new instru-
ment refined during a long process (e.g. Spring Spyre [32]
or Tweeter L2Ork [7]).
4.3 Reflection on NIME Practice
We acknowledge that many NIMEs are conceived as a Proof
of Concept (PoC) or result from Research Through Design
(RtD) processes. We fully support this form of research;
much activity in the NIME community can already be seen
as a form of critical research rather than simply product
development. For instance, Bowers and colleagues aim to
“broaden the design space” of NIME [6] or critically inter-
vene in “technicist” research areas [5]. Interestingly, these
works did not produce new instruments or interfaces, rather
their outcome consisted of new performances combining an
assemblage of a variety of experimental makings followed by
critical reflection. It is also worth mentioning that RtD has
been used to investigate different forms of appropriation—
for instance by focusing on dimensionality [93] or constraints
[39]—which implies an interest in different usage of a sys-
tem by multiple persons. We have also seen how research
agendas of individual researchers or research groups have
developed valuable strategies to facilitate a long-term en-
gagement with “old” NIMEs, such as the team working on
the T-stick.
However, it is clear that the majority of papers presented
at the conference still focus on the development of new tech-
nologies. That may be more representative of the phrasing
of calls for papers and the peer review processes than ac-
tual artistic practice. For the 2022 conference, a special call
for music NIMEs with a Story 3 was dedicated to reusing
NIMEs for new pieces or performances. As a result, 11
pieces (∼39%) out of 28 selected belonged to this category.
This is significantly higher than the 27 out of 269 papers
presented in the last three years ( ∼10%), and the fact that
only 22% of the NIMEs presented at the conference between
2010 and 2014 were used in public performances more than
one time [76].
4.4 Limitations
Our review was based on the initial filtering of papers based
on the content of their abstracts. Thus there is the risk
of “false negatives”, papers that have been excluded despite
discussing NIMEs that have been presented before. One ex-
ample is the case of FAAB [69], which is simply described in
the abstract as a new NIME. Similarly, Mice and Mcpher-
son [71] presented a new study on the Chaos Bells, which
was previously published at CHI [72].
There are also other forms of papers whose academic con-
tribution is based on a longitudinal analysis of practices,
such as papers focused on lab practices (e.g. EmuteLab [61],
The Proto-Langspil: Launching an Icelandic NIME [1]);
self-reflection from a subsets community (e.g. Latin Amer-
ican NIME community [65]); long-term engagement (five
years) in the classroom [87] producing reflections on NIME
pedagogy; longitudinal ethnographic studies that lead to re-
flections on accessible music technologies [59]; or systematic
literature reviews (e.g. [31, 66]) that scrutinise practices de-
veloped across multiple editions of the conference. However,
the focus of this paper is on “new” vs “old” NIMEs, by look-
ing at moments in the lifespan of individual technologies and
how such technologies are integrated into long-term NIME
practice.
5. CONCLUSION
This paper continues an ongoing critical discourse [21, 64,
70, 71] on challenges related to overly focusing on newness
within the NIME community. In particular, we analysed
the last three editions (2020-2021-2022) of the conference
proceedings. Our analysis showed that the majority of re-
cent papers focus on presenting new technologies and we
commented on the underpinning ideology of this trend [73,
64, 77].
In the corpus of analysed papers, we identified four strate-
gies that facilitate and promote long-term engagements with
NIMEs. We integrated these strategies with the life-cycle
of a musical artefact as articulated by Masu and colleagues
[67]: Making—Testing—Using—Disposing. In doing so, we
suggest how these strategies can promote sustainability from
both an environmental perspective and in relation to the
practice.
We acknowledge that developing new technologies is at
the core of the NIME community. However, a sole focus on
novelty and newness risks leaving out sustainability in its
different forms, i.e. environmental and the results. As sug-
gested by Dourish, sustainability should not be addressed
in terms of individual choices [26], this is a matter to be
tackled by the community. We suggest that specific con-
ference calls, workshops, or working groups could support
more sustainable NIME research. Such actions should not
substitute—but complement—current NIME practices.
