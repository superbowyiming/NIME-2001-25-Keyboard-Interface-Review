ABSTRACT
We present an attachment for the bass guitar which allows
MIDI-controlled actuated fretting. This instrument adap-
tation is presented as a potential method of augmenting the
bass guitar for those with upper-limb disabilities. Following
a survey of 48 bassists, we found that timbral and dynamic
features related to the plucking hand were most important
to the survey respondents. We designed an actuated fretting
mechanism to replace the role of the fretting hand in order
to preserve plucking hand techniques. We conducted a per-
formance study in which experienced bassists performed an
accompaniment to a backing track with the adapted bass.
This highlighted ways in which adapting a fretted string
instrument in this way impacts plucking hand technique.

1. INTRODUCTION
The majority of traditional western musical instruments are
designed to be played with both hands. Even for instru-
ments such as the piano which can be played one-handed,
the written repertoire generally requires two-handed play-
ing. This is clearly prohibitive to musicians with upper-limb
disabilities who wish to participate in music performance
with a traditional instrument.
In collaboration with the One-Handed Musical Instru-
ment (OHMI) Trust1, we designed a prototype adaptation
for the bass guitar which allows mechanical fretting of the
strings via foot control, leaving the plucking hand available
for string excitation. Here we present our design, based on
similar work and the results of a player survey, followed by
the results of a performance study with the bass.

2. BACKGROUND
Larsen presents a review of existing accessible musical in-
struments [4]. Of these, one in particular is related to one-
handed playing, being the Actuated Guitar [3]. Other ac-
cessible guitar instruments include the guitarMasheen [6],
a fully-actuated acoustic guitar with an iPad interface, and
the KellyCaster2, designed by John Kelly and members of
Drake Music. The OHMI Trust present winners of their an-
nual one-handed instrument design competition, featuring
many examples of accessible and adapted instruments 1.
Kapur’s review of musical robotics discusses projects which
involve mechanical approaches to fretting and plucking [2].
3. PLAYER SURVEY
We conducted an online survey of 48 bassists in order to
discover what players felt were the most important aspects
of bass guitar playing. We asked participants to rank ten
diﬀerent performance elements in terms of their importance
to playing bass. The respondents’ emphasis on elements
related to the plucking hand (rhythmic accuracy, rhythm
choice, dynamics, plucking hand articulation) suggests that
for bass guitar, much of the expression of the instrument
comes from the plucking hand. This was echoed by one
respondent’s comment that ‘you could do so much simply
by sticking to the [root notes] and diﬀering where, how and
how hard you play the notes’. Details of the survey, the
instrument and performance study will be available in a
forthcoming paper [1].
4. ACTUATED FRETTING MECHANISM
The results from our survey suggested that preserving the
role of the plucking hand would also preserve the most im-
portant aspects of bass playing. We opted to replace the
fretting hand with an actuated fretting mechanism, and
transfer note selection to the feet via a MIDI controller.
Our fretting mechanism consists of a series of clamps which
attach to either side of the neck, and hold six pull-type
solenoid motors perpendicular to the fretboard. This is a
prototype design using a limited number of frets to test our
concept. The solenoid plungers are attached to the tip of
the fretting arms, which are ﬁxed onto a threaded metal
rod on the opposite side of the neck, acting as a hinge. A
spring return at the base returns the fretting arms to the
rest height once the solenoid is deactivated. Figure 1 shows
a schematic of the design.
We used the Bela platform [5] to drive the solenoid motors
and to communicate with the MIDI controller. The Arturia
Beatstep’s3 grid layout allows notes to be mapped similar

to the layout of a fretboard, with columns for fret position,
and rows for strings. This is based on Norman’s ‘natural
mapping’ approach [7]. Figure 2 shows the mapping lay-
out we used. We added a reversed layout for a left-handed
player who took part in the study.
We measured the system for latency by placing a piezo
sensor underneath the contact with the fretting arm and
another taped to the corresponding pad on the controller.
We then measured the delay between the piezo’s voltage
change onsets when the button was pressed, using a digital
oscilloscope. Over ten recordings, we recorded an average
latency of around 54 ms.
5. PERFORMANCE STUDY
Our performance study featured six bassists, who were in-
structed to compose and rehearse an accompaniment to an
eight-bar backing track, for a minimum of two hours, spread
over three weeks. Once the participants had ﬁnished prepar-
ing their accompaniment, we recorded audio and video of
their performances. They then ﬁlled in a questionnaire de-
tailing their responses to the instrument’s usability and how
they felt it had aﬀected their technique.
A key ﬁnding was the way in which participants responded
to the lack of fretting-hand muting functionality. With two
hands, the strings can be muted with the fretting hand fol-
lowing string skipping or to shorten the notes for staccato
playing, by gently touching the strings to stop vibration.
This is impossible with our fretting system due to the bi-
nary nature of the solenoid motors. We noticed that the
four performers who used a ﬁnger-picking style all used their
plucking hand to perform these functional mutes, resulting
in an adaptation of their plucking hand technique. Of these,
one of the participants gave a particularly notable perfor-
mance, appearing to have gained suﬃcient control over this
extended technique after two hours of rehearsal. Another
participant used an alternate approach: consistent palm-
muted plucking with a plectrum. This was an interesting
example of a performer using a fairly typical bass playing
technique as a response to the limitations of the system.
The questionnaire highlighted players’ subjective responses
to the system. Most participants pointed out the diﬃculty
in using the feet for such a precise task, but two commented
that the interface was intuitive to use. Participants were in-
vited to discuss the extent to which common bass techniques
were possible with the adapted bass. Most agreed that ges-
tures such as string bends, slides and dead notes were impos-
sible with the system. There was disagreement between par-
ticipants on the possibility of achieving hammer-ons. Two
stated that hammer-ons were easy or intuitive to achieve,
whereas another said they were possible but not controlled,
and another commented that they were impossible to play.
This is perhaps a function of terminology: the idiosyncratic
attack and amplitude of the mechanical hammer-on is quite
distinct from a typical hammer-on with the hand. This
could also be a function of the system latency: 54 ms might
be tolerable when using the fretting system for note selec-
tion, but less so when used for note onset during mechanical
hammer-ons. This agrees with Wessel and Wright’s quoted
10 ms upper limit for latency tolerance in DMIs [8].
6. CONCLUSION
Our prototype bass guitar adaptation and subsequent study
highlighted ways in which musicians adapt their technique
when the role of a particular hand is transferred to an al-
ternate limb in this way. The user study also highlighted
successes and limitations of this approach, which we hope
will inform future accessible string instrument adaptations.
