ABSTRACT
This project explores the potential for 3D modelling and
printing to create customised ﬂutes that can play music in
a variety of microtonal scales. One of the challenges in the
ﬁeld of microtonality is that conventional musical instru-
ments are inadequate for realising the abundance of the-
oretical tunings that musicians wish to investigate. This
paper focuses on the development of two types of ﬂutes, the
recorder and transverse ﬂute, with interchangeable mouth-
pieces. These ﬂutes are designed to play subharmonic mi-
crotonal scales. The discussion provides an overview of the
design and implementation process, including calculation
methods for acoustic modelling and 3D printing technolo-
gies, as well as an evaluation of some of the diﬃculties en-
countered. Results from our 3D printed ﬂutes suggest that
whilst further reﬁnements are necessary in our designs, 3D
modelling and printing techniques oﬀer new and valuable
methods for the design and production of customised mu-
sical instruments. The long term goal of this project is to
create a system in which users can specify the tuning of their
instrument to generate a 3D model and have it printed on
demand.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
In recent years, there have been several examples of musical
instruments made with 3D printing. Many of these projects
tend to replicate existing instruments for comparison with
the sounds of the original model, such as a 3D printed copy
of a Stradivarius violin [20] or a 3D printed ﬂute [25]. Oth-
ers have used 3D printing to create new instrument bod-
ies or shells for electric guitars, drums and keyboards, but

.
these instruments rely on non-3D printed hardware (such as
pickups, bridges, necks and machine heads) for their sound
production [7].
In contrast, our project takes advantage of 3D printing’s
unique ability to customise designs for the purpose of creat-
ing ﬂutes that can play microtonal tunings not possible on
standard instruments. 3D CAD software is used to gener-
ate 3D models of the ﬂutes and these are then printed using
high resolution inkjet based 3D printing technology (Objet
Connex 350). Comparisons between the theoretical models
and actual 3D printed ﬂutes allow for greater understand-
ing of the acoustics of microtonal wind instruments. The
long term goal of this new approach is to create a system
in which, instead of the manufacturer dictating the tuning,
musicians are able to customise the tuning of their instru-
ment for their own unique needs and have it printed on
demand.
1.2 Microtonality
Microtonality is a label that refers to tuning systems that
include intervals smaller than the regular semitone, but it
can also refer more generally to any scale other than the con-
ventional Western system of 12-tone equal temperament. It
is often assumed that 12-tone equal temperament, best rep-
resented by the 12 black and white notes of the keyboard, is
a universal standard, and most of the music we hear today
in the West is built around this scale. In reality, however,
many other systems of tuning are possible. For example,
a rich variety of scales with many more notes than just
12 are found in music from diﬀerent cultures of the world,
and Western music itself has a long history of diﬀerent tun-
ings also. Microtonal tuning is a rapidly expanding area
in which musicians from various genres are experimenting
with a diverse range of tuning systems in their search for
new resources for making music. In the future, instead of
a single system, it is likely that musicians will adopt many
diﬀerent approaches to tuning.
1.2.1 Microtonal Instruments
One of the challenges in the ﬁeld of microtonality is that
conventional musical instruments are inadequate for real-
ising the abundance of theoretical tunings that musicians
wish to investigate. Already there is signiﬁcant interest in
instruments with microtonal capabilities, such as keyboards
[16] and re-fretted guitars [22], but there seem to be very
few microtonal wind instruments on the market.
Flutes are of particular interest because they are consid-
286
ered to be amongst the oldest instruments in existence and
they are also found in many cultures around the world [18].
There are diﬀerent types of ﬂutes, from side-blown to end-
blown examples, as well as whistles, ocarinas, panpipes and
so on. For our project we chose to focus on two types of
ﬂutes: the recorder, or ﬁpple ﬂute, because they are rela-
tively easy to play and maintain a stable pitch, and a simple
transverse ﬂute, without movable parts such as keys for the
time being, in order to begin with a minimal design.
Zoran demonstrated that a replica concert ﬂute could be
produced with 3D printing [25] but there were problems
with water-tightness of walls and decomposition of material,
which meant the ﬂutes were not musically viable. More re-
cently, Harrison has also developed software for 3D printing
various ﬂutes, whistles and shawms [10], but none of these
are designed to play microtonal scales. Furthermore, there
is no literature explaining or validating the mathematical
methodology behind these designs.
It is possible for wind players to achieve microtonal pitches
on their instruments using normal performance techniques
such as adjusting their embouchure, or varying the speed
and direction of the air stream. It is also common for cross-
ﬁngerings to be used [4] and much research has been done
in this area for ﬂutes [6] as well as recorders [3]. Alter-
nate ﬁngerings, however, can sometimes be awkward or dif-
ﬁcult to achieve, especially in fast passages of music, and
are not always practical. The resulting pitches for cross-
ﬁngered notes may also vary between diﬀerent models of
instruments. Furthermore, they can also result in changes
in timbre, which may or may not be desirable.
How can 3D printing help solve these problems? The aim
of this project is to explore the potential for 3D printing to
create a set of custom-designed ﬂutes that can play music in
a variety of microtonal scales without the need for elaborate
alternate ﬁngerings.
A group at Glasgow University is reportedly developing a
3D printed clarinet focusing on 19-tone equal temperament
[1]. In contrast, our project aims to develop a 3D modelling
and printing work-ﬂow that allows customised designs for a
range of diﬀerent microtonal tunings, not just one particu-
lar scale. To achieve this, our project to date has involved
designing and printing ﬂutes based on pre-existing models,
then extending this work to explore the eﬀects of modify-
ing several variables, such as the position and size of tone
holes, as well as the shape and dimensions of the bore of
the instruments. These are parameters that normally can-
not be varied using standard mass production manufactur-
ing methods. We have also developed two diﬀerent types
of mouthpieces for a recorder and transverse ﬂute, with the
goal of producing a set of microtonal ﬂute bodies with in-
terchangeable mouthpieces.
2. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
Wind instruments typically consist of a tube in which a
standing wave is generated by an excitation mechanism,
such as a player blowing into a mouthpiece. Pitch is con-
trolled by changing the eﬀective acoustic length of the in-
strument [2]. This is usually done by opening or closing tone
holes resulting in a shorter or longer standing wave being
established. It should be noted that the eﬀective acoustic
length diﬀers from the physical length of the instrument. In
instrument design, notes can be tuned up by enlarging the
holes, or shortening the length of the tube. Alternatively,
notes can be tuned down by making the holes smaller, or
extending the eﬀective acoustic length by making the tube
longer. The problem with extending the acoustic length is
that it can be diﬃcult to add material to make the tube
longer. This is why instrument building is often an iter-
ative subtractive process in which the instrument maker
begins with a longer tube and then gradually reduces the
length until a desired tuning is achieved. Another reason
for this manual tuning requirement is due to traditional
manufacturing processes resulting in variations between one
produced instrument and another. Contrary to this, 3D
printing is an additive technique that allows for very exact
manufacture of physical components and parts based on 3D
design models. Hence, manufacturing variations between
diﬀerent produced instruments are signiﬁcantly reduced and
the key task is to design an accurate 3D model.
2.1 Calculation and Methodology
Producing a complete mathematical model of a wind instru-
ment is a challenge. While a model may very accurately
match a particular style and tuning system, when certain
characteristics of the instrument are changed the model may
diverge greatly from what is expected. To calculate the de-
sign parameters of wind instruments a number of techniques
have previously been explored. The two main methods are
direct numerical simulation and approximation of acoustic
impedances by bore segmentation.
Direct numerical simulation methods such as the Finite
Element Method (FEM) can characterise the nature of exci-
tation mechanisms and wind instrument acoustics [14]. The
drawbacks of direct numerical simulations include computa-
tional requirements, software licensing, time and expertise
needed. It would usually take a number of hours [14] for a
highly powerful computer to simulate the complete geome-
try of a simple wind instrument. Furthermore, real data is
often needed to verify simulation results or to optimise pa-
rameters of the model. The FEM will be used in future work
to characterise the performance of our 3D printed micro-
tonal ﬂutes that are designed using our modeling approach
described below.
The Transmission Matrix Method (TMM) is an approxi-
mation method which calculates the eﬀective impedances by
segmentation of the bore. Lefebvre explored the use of FEM
to characterise the inaccuracies of the TMM method to es-
timate boundary conditions more accurately [14]. TMM
has also been used to model the characteristics of the Chi-
nese xiao (ﬂute) [13]. Adapting the TMM method to the
design of 3D printed microtonal ﬂutes and validation with
measured data is the subject of future work.
Simpliﬁed theoretical models have been developed based
on research into characterising wind instrument acoustics
by Benade [2] and Nederveen [17]. For our project, a ver-
sion of the mathematical model by Hoekje was rewritten
in MATLAB and modiﬁed to estimate the eﬀective model
parameters used in our designs for our desired microtonal
scales. The model is based on the work of Benade and de-
scribed by Hoekje in [12].
Calculations are made to ﬁnd the locations of each hole
to produce a desired playing frequency. This is based on
an acoustical model that relates the sound frequency to the
length, diameter and thickness of a pipe or tube. A tube of
a given length that is open at both ends and has no ﬁnger
holes can produce sound of a desired frequency based on
physical acoustics relating the speed of sound to the length
of the tube. A ﬁnger hole results in an increase in the eﬀec-
tive length of the tube and so this needs to be accounted for
so that the ﬂute still produces the same desired frequency
as a tube without ﬁnger holes.
The model ﬁrstly approximates the eﬀective length of an
acoustic tube for a single ﬁnger hole and derives an end cor-
rection factor. This gives the actual tube length required
when a single ﬁnger hole is open, as well as the correspond-
287
ing location for the hole. This step is repeated to ﬁnd end
corrections for additional open holes as well as corrections
resulting from closed holes. Initially the mouthpiece end
correction was approximated following the work of Hoekje
[11] to produce Recorder 1 which is discussed in the eval-
uation (Section 3) below. In the next iteration, the end
correction was interpolated from a small data set of exper-
imentally measured end corrections to produce Recorder 2.
The application of this model to our design is discussed in
the section below.
2.2 Design and 3D Printing
2.2.1 Mouthpiece Design
The acoustic excitation source is a fundamental component
of all wind instruments. To begin the design process we
started by printing existing 3D models of recorders. We
found that most of these designs were not playable or pro-
duced undesirable higher harmonics due to problems with
the mouthpiece.
Next, we replicated the design of a commercially avail-
able Aulos alto recorder mouthpiece. The design is shown
in Figure 1 with some basic dimensions included. Initially
the recorder mouthpiece was printed using a fused deposi-
tion modelling (FDM) based 3D printer (Dimension uPrint-
Plus). This system can be considered a low resolution 3D
printer with a layer height of 0.254mm. The general opera-
tion of the system sees a thin ﬁlament of ABS polymer be-
ing extruded through a heated nozzle while being positioned
by a 3 axis robot. While this results in robust models for
demonstration purposes, there is a distinct roughened sur-
face ﬁnish that aﬀects airﬂow in comparison to the smooth
surface that would result from a typical injection moulded
component.
Figure 1: Recorder mouthpiece design.
Another limitation of FDM technology for this applica-
tion is the minimum wall thickness that can be achieved.
In particular it was found that the desired sharpness of the
labium, the hard-edged blade of the mouthpiece, could not
be achieved through this approach. A common feature of 3D
printing technologies is the use of a sacriﬁcial support mate-
rial to allow the production of complex geometries. Again,
for this application it was found that the support mate-
rial used in the FDM process would negatively aﬀect the
quality of the surface ﬁnish. Through physical ﬂute models
produced using the FDM approach it was observed that the
internal surface roughness of the bore caused the player to
have to produce higher blowing pressures and that a longer
time was needed to produce and establish a stable note in
comparison to a typical commercial ﬂute.
Ultimately, while FDM technology does allow the produc-
tion of a physical model, the layer resolution and surface
ﬁnish that are achievable do not enable the reliable produc-
tion of the ﬁne features that are necessary. Another more
sophisticated form of 3D printing, Polyjet Technology, was
chosen as a more reliable alternative. The main beneﬁts of
this technology are: a dramatically increased layer height
resolution of 0.016mm as opposed to the 0.254mm of FDM,
a signiﬁcantly improved surface ﬁnish, gas-tight walls, and
the ability for the printed material to be hand ﬁnished to
further improve surface roughness. This technology relies
on UV cured acrylate base materials. In this case a propri-
etary material called Objet MED610 was selected, so that
a robust, rigid component with excellent feature deﬁnition
could be produced using an Objet Connex 350 printing sys-
tem.
Using the Polyjet printer to print the recorder mouth-
piece, a much sharper labium was achieved. Initial compar-
isons between the commercial Aulos mouthpiece and our
3D printed one showed little distinguishable diﬀerence in
pitch and blowing pressure required. To further improve
the design, the wind-way or narrow duct through which the
breath passes, was increased to allow a higher volumetric
airﬂow rate to account for any wall smoothness issues and
to aid in the cleaning process. This resulted in very loud
and stable notes to be established.
In addition to the recorder mouthpiece, a head joint for
a transverse ﬂute was also printed on the higher resolution
Objet Connex 350 printer. This was based on the design of
a Western concert ﬂute with a simple taper towards the em-
bouchure hole. The head joint connection was designed so it
is interchangeable with the recorder mouthpiece. Due to the
high resolution of the printer, a relatively sharp edge was
produced and notes were easy to sustain. Figure 2 shows
the prototype head sections for the recorder and transverse
ﬂute.

joints.
2.2.2 Acoustic Body Design
In addition to the mouthpiece, the body of an Aulos alto
recorder with standard tuning was also replicated. For sim-
plicity, we started with a straight bore with a diameter
of 17.3mm to make it compatible with commercially made
mouthpieces. Wall thickness was 3.2mm and size of ﬁnger
holes ranged from 4mm to 6.5mm in diameter. The size
and location of tone holes were calculated from the acoustic
model described by Hoekje and the frequencies required for
our microtonal scale pitches (Figure 3) were implemented
using the method described in Section 2.1.
2.3 Microtonal Scales
The ﬁrst microtonal tunings to be implemented for the
project was a set of subharmonic scales. These are scales
built from notes of the subharmonic series, which is the
inversion or mirror of the more familiar harmonic series.
288
Figure 3: 3D printed microtonal ﬂute bodies.
Subharmonic scales were chosen as a starting point for our
ﬂutes because of their potential to be realised using sim-
ple designs consisting of equally-spaced ﬁnger holes, as sug-
gested somewhat controversially by musicologist Kathleen
Schlesinger [21]. Such scales would ﬁt comfortably under
the hand without the need for cross-ﬁngerings or special
keys to cover tone holes.
Subharmonic scales also provide a useful test case for im-
plementing microtonal tunings because unlike equal tem-
peraments, they consist of intervals that are not equidis-
tant but vary in size between successive notes of the scale.
Furthermore, tuning theorist Erv Wilson has proposed vari-
ous methods for extending subharmonic ﬂute scales through
simple modiﬁcations, thus enabling a diverse range of tun-
ing options to be generated [24]. Details for one of the
subharmonic scales used in the project are given in Table 1
below.
3. EV ALUATION
The project so far has prioritised the development of a mi-
crotonal recorder over the transverse ﬂute, mainly because
it is easier to produce and maintain a stable pitch on the
recorder. To test our instruments, recordings were made in
an anechoic environment with a Behringer ECM8000 mea-
surement microphone and Behringer ADA8000 pre-ampliﬁer.
Recordings were then analysed using Melodyne software [15]
to obtain pitch information.
Table 1 compares notes of diﬀerent recorders that were
produced for a particular subharmonic scale. This scale
spans a section of the subharmonic series from the 7th to
12th subharmonics, with target frequencies for each note of
the scale shown in the second column of the table. Results
for our ﬁrst attempt at producing a subharmonic instru-
ment (Recorder 1) are shown in the third column. Diﬀer-
ences from the target frequencies are shown in cents in the
fourth column. Subsequently, another instrument was pro-
duced (Recorder 2), resulting in improved pitch accuracy
for some but not all notes of the scale. Minor adjustments
were made manually to Recorder 2 by ﬁling two of the tone
holes. The results from these modiﬁcations are shown in the
rightmost columns of the table. Although the accuracy of
particular pitches ﬂuctuated, the average diﬀerence in cents
was improved overall with each new version of the recorder.
Whilst the intonation of wind instruments will always be
inﬂuenced by the performer, our goal is to continue to im-
prove the pitch accuracy of our 3D-printed designs to no
more than a ﬁve cent error so that manual adjustments are
not needed.
One of the advantages of 3D printing is that it allows
identical components of an instrument design to be repro-
duced with the same acoustic qualities. This was veriﬁed
by printing identical pairs of subharmonic recorders with
matching pitches. These instruments have been used suc-

cessfully in numerous live musical performances in conjunc-
tion with other microtonal instruments [23] [5].
3.1 Conclusions and Future Work
Our research shows that 3D modelling and printing tech-
niques oﬀer new approaches to instrument design and pro-
duction. The inﬁnite ﬂexibility of 3D printing technology
provides an excellent opportunity to experiment with new
designs, particularly designs that are impractical to produce
through conventional means. For example, to demonstrate
the possibilities of what can be achieved through 3D print-
ing we created an experimental ﬂute with a double mouth-
piece connected to two tubes that are twisted together into a
double helix shape (Figure 4). This instrument, along with
two other 3D-printed examples of a microtonal transverse
ﬂute and recorder, was showcased in a recent exhibition that
featured designs using cutting-edge technologies [8].
3D printing also allows for greater understanding of acous-
tic instrument design through its capacity to reproduce iden-
tical components whilst also enabling speciﬁc modiﬁcations.
Although we have found prior research into the mechanics of
wind instruments using parametric equations to be suitable
for approximating notes, further reﬁnements are needed in
order to achieve the level of accuracy we seek for microtonal
ﬂutes.
One of the limitations experienced so far is that we have
not been able to fully characterise the frequency dependency
of the mouthpiece by simply calculating the end correction.
In the next stage of our project, mouthpiece characteri-
sation will be addressed by collecting a large data set of
pitches from the recorder and transverse head joints. We
also hope to improve the accuracy of our designs by explor-
ing methods from [19] and [14], such as the TMM optimi-
sation using FEM simulations.
With improved acoustic models, we plan to extend our re-
search to implement other microtonal tunings beyond sub-
harmonic scales. Complementary 3D scanning techniques
could also be used to replicate rare or inaccessible instru-
ments, such as ﬂutes from diﬀerent cultures as well as his-
torical examples. Another direction we would like to ex-
plore is the use of diﬀerent types of materials in additive
fabrication. Flutes serve as the initial stage in an investiga-
tion that could be extended to other woodwind and brass
instruments in the future.
Our long term goal is to provide a design tool that allows
a user to request a speciﬁc set of pitches for their instru-
ment and have it printed on demand. We believe that 3D
printing has the potential to challenge traditional methods
for manufacturing musical instruments: instead of the man-
ufacturer determining the construction of an instrument, in
the future customers will be able to specify the design of
their instrument for their own unique needs for creating
new music.
