ABSTRACT
In digital musical instrument design, diﬀerent tools and
methods oﬀer a variety of approaches for constraining the
exploration of musical gestures and sounds. Toolkits made
of modular components usefully constrain exploration to-
wards simple, quick and functional combinations, and meth-
ods such as sketching and model-making alternatively allow
imagination and narrative to guide exploration. In this work
we sought to investigate a context where these approaches
to exploration were combined. We designed a craft work-
shop for 20 musical instrument designers, where groups were
given the same partly-ﬁnished instrument to craft for one
hour with raw materials, and though the task was open
ended, they were prompted to focus on subtle details that
might distinguish their instruments. Despite the prompt
the groups diverged dramatically in intent and style, and
generated gestural language rapidly and ﬂexibly. By the
end, each group had developed a distinctive approach to
constraint, exploratory style, collaboration and interpreta-
tion of the instrument and workshop materials. We reﬂect
on this outcome to discuss advantages and disadvantages
to integrating digital musical instrument design tools and
methods, and how to further investigate and extend this
approach.

1. INTRODUCTION
Magnusson [13] emphasises the pronounced epistemic di-
mension of digital instruments when compared to acous-
tic ones; digital instruments are created top-down through
prior absorption of a technical, symbolic body of knowl-
edge, after which an explicit implementation is designed.
In contrast, they describe acoustic instrument creation as
being tied to bottom-up processes; acoustic and mechanical

properties of materials are explored experientially leading to
their conﬁguration into instruments. With acoustic mate-
rials, Magnusson describes, “the sound generation (and the
required knowledge of it) is given to us for free by nature”
[14].
Acknowledging the beneﬁts of this direct relationship with
material, many digital instruments and design tools aim to
give designers and players a comparable freedom to explore.
Many examples of this exist, such as in modular synthesis
where notionally symbolic circuits are explored as hands-on
material [6]. Software arts practitioners and tool makers
have emphasised the importance of materiality and craft in
exploring code [3, 12]. Innovative works in e-textiles [25]
and paper electronics [24] integrate functionality directly
into materials, inviting new ways to explore function and
form. An altogether diﬀerent exploratory experience is pro-
vided by instrument design methods employing sketching,
ﬁction and imagination [1, 17].
Inspired by these various approaches, we were motivated
to investigate a context where the constraints of a toolkit
[14] and the openness of craft-inspired [11] model-making
coincide. We created a workshop where groups of partici-
pants used crafting materials to modify a kit-based digital
musical instrument prototype that we described as “unﬁn-
ished”to encourage exploration. In this work we seek to in-
terpret the responses and outcomes to gain insight into the
impact of combining diﬀerent styles of constraints, and to
understand how diﬀerent materials aﬀect exploratory pro-
cess in digital musical instrument design.
The next section of this paper contrasts diﬀerent ap-
proaches to supporting exploration in digital musical instru-
ment design. Subsequently the workshop design is detailed,
and the outcomes are reported on and discussed. We con-
clude by reﬂecting on their possible consequences for com-
bining instrument design tools and methods.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Comparing across toolkits and methods
Digital instrument design toolkits are useful design aids that
abstract implementation details into modular parts whose
combination can be rapidly explored. Toolkits reﬂect spe-
ciﬁc musical cultures and knowledges [13] such as instru-
ment classiﬁcation systems [4] and synthesis approaches,
which through abstraction gain extra ﬂexibility allowing for
novel recombinations. One disadvantage of toolkits is that
the original material qualities of the parts are no longer
present; a tangible media token of cardboard, plastic or
wallpaper will still perform the same function [23]. Another
disadvantage is that in reifying familiar bodies of knowledge,
they make bottom-up exploration outside of those bound-
aries diﬃcult at the expense of artistic appropriation [5, 8].

While evidence suggests that expert toolkit users overcome
the toolkit’s inﬂuence [3], for beginners it is easy to mistake
a toolkit’s perspective for the art and craft itself [18].
Alternative approaches to toolkit-based design exploration
aim to provide diﬀerent constraints. They propose that
where design media exerts less inﬂuence on which ideas are
easy to represent, the designer can instead explore personal
expression and imagination [22]. These approaches are often
led by material and conceptual interests, taking inspiration
from craft principles [11] and traditional design methods like
sketching [17] and ﬁctional model-making [1]. Unlike with
design toolkits, in these methods designers are sometimes
distanced from real interactions and behaviours as these in-
stead take on looser or imaginary forms. Ultimately, these
diﬀering approaches to exploration could oﬀer complimen-
tary beneﬁts to digital luthiers.
2.2 Addressing diverse needs in digital lutherie
Digital luthiers are highly interdisciplinary practitioners who
often perform combined roles of inventor, maker and player
[10, 19]. As designers they need to explore the implementa-
tion, look and feel, and role of their designs as separate and
integrated issues [9], typically as part of a non-linear process
[7]. In their process they need to not only formulate and
synthesise new ideas, but also take reiﬁed ideas and proto-
types and make them“malleable”[1] through decomposition
and dissection [20].
Recognising these diverse needs, we designed a workshop
facilitating exploration using both toolkit and craft-inspired
approaches to investigate the following questions:
• How do participants explore in an environment featuring
both a kit-based instrument and crafting materials?
• How do they balance the material constraints against the
constraints of their own ideas?
• How do they develop musical gestures?
3. WORKSHOP DESIGN
A digital lutherie workshop focusing on craft practice was
held during NIME 2017. It was free and open to anyone reg-
istered for NIME, and no submission was required. We ex-
pected but did not require participants to be digital luthiers,
and participants with experience in traditional or acoustic
instrument making or non-musical crafts were also welcome.
The organisers gave an introduction to the subject area,
where they introduced a theme of craft in NIME [2] as a
starting point for discussion. We devised a crafting activ-
ity that would compliment discussions and reﬂection about
craft in NIME, and how it can be shared in the community.
3.1 The Unﬁnished Instrument
The goal of the activity was to facilitate open ended craft-
ing of a prototype instrument, that could appear to be
“unﬁnished” and subjectively reinterpreted. This process
is illustrated in Figure 1 and started with appropriating
[5] and un-crafting [20] an existing instrument called the
AirHarp1 developed by Chris Heinrichs in C++ using the
Bela platform [15], chosen for its ﬂexible synthesis of vir-
tual string sounds using audio-rate sensor inputs. Its phys-
ical model excited by an accelerometer was replaced with
up to eight low cost microphone capsules. This oﬀered a
high-bandwidth connection between physical behaviour and
sonic response, necessary for facilitating gestural interaction
using a wide variety of materials.
To provide a contrast to previous workshops and inte-
grate with the crafting materials, we focused on mechanical
instead of software and electronic modularity. Simple and
repeatable prototypes were developed using the microphone
capsules, that would facilitate physical modiﬁcation via ma-
terials available from a craft modelling store. Two gestural
interactions were oﬀered as demonstration: a plucking con-
ﬁguration featuring wooden tines clamped across the mi-
crophone cavity, and a tapping conﬁguration which allowed
diﬀerent surface materials to be clamped across all of the
microphones to form a surface.
These two example conﬁgurations were then generalised
in terms of their physical structure, such that both could be
made from the same basic components. Introducing ﬂexi-
bility into the design required trial and error to strike a
balance between openness and robustness; for example the
microphones had to sit ﬁrmly in place but still be movable,
and the physical structure featured slots instead of holes
where possible to make it adjustable. The ﬁnal design2 was
presented to participants along with its two pre-explored
conﬁgurations (pluck and tap).
3.2 Crafting environment
The room consisted of tables for small groups of 2-5 to sit
around facing each other. There was a long table at one
side of the room displaying a variety of tools and crafting
materials. The organisers presented the opening discussion
from a projector at the front and provided technical support
around the room.
Materials were selected for their familiarity and tactile
and acoustic variety, and included rods of aluminium, brass,
wood and plastic, sheets of various foams and metal meshes,
paper, corrugated card, thick card, cork balls and granules,
folding clips, and googley eyes. Tools included scissors, wire
cutters, jewellery pliers and cutters, adhesives, double sided
tape and foam tape, duct tape, blu tack, notepads, pens and
miniature cameras. Each group had at least one camera
which they could use to document their crafting (consent
forms were signed for ﬁlming). Tools and materials could
be used in any quantity by any group at any time.

3.3 Data collection
Immediately before and after the workshop, participants
shared their reﬂections on their own craft practice and their
crafting experience. Days after the workshop, reﬂections
and feedback were gathered from participants via in-person
interviews and an online survey.
4. OUTCOMES
The workshop had 20 participants encompassing research,
instrument design, teaching, composing and performance.
They were split into four groups (G1-4) but were given no
brief for how they should collaborate. In this section, the
groups’crafting process and outcomes are described. Par-
ticipants’reﬂections are then thematised based on the ques-
tions in 2.2. An emergent theme of collaboration process is
also presented.
4.1 Overview of outcomes
4.1.1 Group 1
G1 split into two subgroups and worked with two separate
instruments (termed G1A and G1B).
G1A: “It started out with the elastic bands in the way of
it just being easy to get a string eﬀect on the string sound
and do multiple sensors at once. Then we started with duct
tape and getting the sound of pulling the tape oﬀ the other
tape to get the kind of like [ripping] sound which was really
nice. And [redacted] suggested velcro which kind of wound
up in this way [scrapes velcro] where you can play it like a
plucked harp like thing. And then it’s also just really fun to
whip it [with a giant foam stick].”
G1B: “We just split diﬀerent microphones onto separate
layers so you can play them. And it could be like a multi-
player sort of instrument [two players demonstrate]. And we
thought about developing diﬀerent materials for each layer
to get diﬀerent sounds. That’s pretty much it.”
4.1.2 Group 2
G2’s instrument was demonstrated as two versions. The
ﬁrst was described as a ‘feedback organ’ where cardboard
tubes could be telescopically lengthened to produce diﬀerent
timbres of feedback, with each microphone isolated.
G2: “One group member suggested something where we
could throw objects into it and they would rattle around.
Then, we decided that the tubes were cool, but would feel
more like an instrument if they were diﬀerent lengths, even
though that wasn’t necessarily functional.”
The second was based on striking the cardboard tubes,
and featured a code modiﬁcation aﬀecting timbre.
G2: “We changed the code in an attempt to make the in-
strument slowly change octaves, but mis-judged the size of
the buﬀer so we created an extremely fast arpeggiator (like
8-bit video game polyphony) instead, which turned out to
give our instrument a unique sound.”
4.1.3 Group 3
G3 split into two subgroups working with two separate in-
struments (G3A and G3B).
G3A: “We tried to ﬁgure out the diﬀerent parameters of
the mass damping but we sort of got slightly lost and got
some help to reboot the project. With 30 seconds left we
switched to the pluck model so all it does is just do the orig-
inal pluck thing. So musically it’s very uninteresting [...]
But what we’ve got is this nice little visual representation of
the evolution of the instrument.”
G3B separated their instrument into four sub-instruments,
three of which were demonstrated.
G3B: “We tried to extend each single microphone and ex-
plore a single microphone, and I think as a whole it would
have been [the idea] to come together at the end. We ex-
plored diﬀerent kinds of sound aesthetics, trying to under-
stand actually what those mics could do and it was quite
limited. In my case I’ve made this sandwich and inside it
there’s the microphone and some bolts, so if you shake it
hard, then you get some sound.”
“This [second sub-instrument] is even more basic, well you
can do this [plucks string against mesh] and [scrapes mesh].
I think the acoustic sounds are more interesting than those
coming from the loudspeaker. One way to use this instru-
ment would be to combine these two sound sources.”
“Here’s one ﬁnal rudimentary part [third sub-instrument].
It doubles as a cruciﬁx, it’s a tapping mechanism, you can
slightly hear it if you twist it around, that’s what I came up
with.”
4.1.4 Group 4
G4: “I guess at ﬁrst we were frustrated with having limited
notes, so we tried a lot of things. Somehow the feedback
seemed to be inspirational and we started to come up with
ways of thinking about the whole animal. We added speaker
rattles and we looked at ways to create eﬀects acoustically
[the group begin performing]. This is the subtractive syn-
thesis bit [microphone attached to a hacksaw]. So the same
idea as [G3B] to mix the acoustic sound.”
4.2 Exploring constraints and constraining ex-
ploration
Most participants said they intended to explore the instru-
ment and materials rather than start with a speciﬁc goal.
This extended to setting aside our suggestion about focus-
ing on subtle details.
G2: “Our intentions were quite geared towards the explo-
ration side anyway so that continued throughout.”
G4: “What was interesting was to discover an instrument
and to basically try to make music with it. So I would say
even though maybe the goal was not announced like that,
we didn’t try at all like theoretically thinking about how to
improve this instrument [...] we just tried to kind of okay
we have this situation let’s try to make music.”
G2: “I think we wanted to do something diﬀerent from what
the other groups did. I don’t think we said that explicitly to
each other, though.”
Where initial ideas were pursued, it sometimes turned out
that the design constraints were not supportive.
G3: “We had this grand idea of having this sort of spring
reverb that was going to allow us to pluck it whilst these
[strings] would carry on vibrating and then the balls would
continue that in a physical way.”
G3: “The thing that I wanted to achieve is to get away from
this pluck stuﬀ and this was my only idea [pulling string
through mesh].”
While the initial conditions of the instrument did not
thrill, and the option to modify the code was there, par-
ticipants still mostly preferred to continue exploring.
G1: “I personally made a conscious decision that I was not
going to try to change the code that was running on the
device because I didn’t want to be in that headspace.”
G1: “Once you get into trying diﬀerent things with it, you
don’t really think about that aspect of the instrument so
much, which I think is important. Because you can spend all
this time tuning the sound, but then you need to spend some
time tuning interaction or exploring interaction as well.”
Once the participants became more familiar with the con-

which included an extra, larger speaker, guitar string and a hacksaw.
straints, they explored through a succession of making, play-
ing and continuous iteration.
G1: “There was an aspect for me that is like it wasn’t so
precious, it wasn’t like a thing that I had built up in my head
as being like, oh I really want to try this speciﬁc thing.”
G1: “Coming into it not really having a clear goal or a clear
expectation made the exploration more fun and lighthearted,
I think it’s analogous to music making.”
G2: “We were free to really think about the physical inter-
action and the visual details that would inﬂuence how the
instrument was played.”
G2: “We were all very quick to discard something if it didn’t
look right.”
G3: “[It was] more or less chaotic, which is a good thing if
you wish to expand the design space.”
As this process developed over time, there were points of
little verbal discussion and instead a shared focus on doing.
G4: “We speciﬁcally acted and we interacted in and not too
much discussion but like, oh you did that let me let me add
that, or you did that let me cut that.”
G2: “It’s kind of just like a feedback system just like idea
bouncing back and forth.”
G2: “It ended up being implemented through playing modes.”
G4: “I actually never experienced like those things, it was
like hmm so I’m doing as I’m experimenting as I’m in do-
ing.”
G2: “It felt like it was very responsive; I am coming with
one idea and and we could just, yes try it out, oh no it
doesn’t work, uh-huh okay [...] It wasn’t any like darlings
that you want to keep and very like quick to come up with
some new ideas when something wasn’t working.”
One participant in G4 reﬂected on the divergence away
from the brief.
G4: “Because everyone in the room was creative, it came to
not at all micro diﬀerences but huge diﬀerences even in the
philosophy of music making or instrument building and the
results themselves. Actually I loved many of the instruments
that the other groups did and they were super diﬀerent.”
4.3 Exploring sound, gesture and materials
In their initial explorations, groups tested out the behaviour
of the instrument, and in some cases these trials were dis-
satisfying or unrewarding, but groups later returned to the
same gestures.
G3: “One of our ﬁrst problems was that it was really quiet,
so we ﬁrst of all tried to make a more directional cone so we
could turn up the gain without it feeding back. That wasn’t
entirely successful.”
G2: “One group member suggested something where we
could throw objects into it and they would rattle around.
We worked for a while trying to make that work (cardboard
tubes, plastic eggs, diﬀerent materials thrown in) but we
didn’t have the right materials to get a good bounce.”
G2: “In my head my ambition was more the acoustic sound
[...] but I didn’t think it through that it was actually de-
stroying the sources [microphones]. One of the other things
that quickly annoyed me was how responsive it felt [...] it
sounds so the same every time [...] so we went looking for
more variation.”
It was not long before the groups had accumulated diﬀer-
ing collections of materials at their tables. The open layout
of the table seemed to suggest ideas.
G2: “It’s good to actually arrive there and have all this
broad range of material and to experience the freedom you
know like the creative freedom that it provides.”
G1: “It was interesting to have this is a kind of playground
to explore diﬀerent kinds of tactility that was then serving
as inspiration for something totally diﬀerent.”
New gestures often resulted from the incidental combi-
nation of ideas, and failed ideas resulted in raw materials
being reused in new ones.
G1: “[G1 participant] was interested started out with rip-
ping tape oﬀ and then that developed to the velcro, and then
at ﬁrst we just tried to put the two side-by-side and then
kind of by accident realised that they complemented each
other [...] like fret noise on a guitar, there’s a bit of a lead
up and then a more deﬁnite pluck sound.”
The process of combining and transforming materials and
gestures were compared to sketching and sculpture, and
happened more rapidly as materials accumulated on tables.
G4: “I found the bass string and some metal and that give
me like a rough idea to try to sketch.”
G2: “[The process] became very much focused on the sculp-
ture.”
G4: “At the end we were always kind of performing with it
or trying it to make sound that was really interesting.”
284
4.4 Exploring collaborative process
The groups diverged in their approach to collaboration (see
Figure 3), and took advantage of the ﬂexibility of the in-
strument’s design to re-conﬁgure as their collaborative style
required.
G1: “You speciﬁed to collaborate in groups but you didn’t
really go beyond that with the detail of how to collaborate,
so it was really nice to see how the diﬀerent groups came
out with very diﬀerent ways of working together. We kind
of split it in half and made two instruments between four
people.”
G3B: “Initially because there was four of us working on it
we tried to extend each single microphone and each explore
a single microphone, and I think as a whole it would have
been [the idea] to come together at the end.”
G1: “The activity and the group environment was super
inspiring, to see what everyone else came up with from the
same initial state.”
G2: “Sometimes we would each take a particular task [...]
and sometimes one of us would decide to experiment with a
new idea while the others worked on something else.”
Across groups, ideas were shared explicitly and implicitly.
G1: “Someone else actually pointed out that connection and
then it made it a little bit more usable.”
G2: “This kind of feedback idea was very collective idea so
it wasn’t one person’s.”
G2: “It was interesting because I never made an instrument
in a group process like that.”

strument structure compared with starting point.
5. DISCUSSION
5.1 Exploring constraints and constraining ex-
ploration
The brief presented the workshop as an opportunity to re-
ﬂect on subtle diﬀerences between outcomes given an iden-
tical starting point, however this was mismatched with the
unconstrained environment. Instead of responding to this
brief, most responded to what emerged from their ideas
and engaging with each other. Although this scripting of
the workshop was light and open responses were welcomed,
it inadvertently motivated playful subversion and appropri-
ation. To engage with subtle diﬀerences of craft, an alter-
native strategy could involve participants presenting and
comparing their own instruments that have similar func-
tions, forms or design processes.
The goal of un-crafting [20] the AirHarp into the Un-
ﬁnished Instrument was to present something complete in
terms of synthesis and sensors, but open to interpretation in
terms of performance and gestures. While the instrument
could only be “re-crafted” so much in one hour, the instru-
ments exhibited personality and style, and they inspired
collaboration and discussion. Some participants wanted the
code to be more accessible, and some were generally dissat-
isﬁed with the resulting artifact itself but still saw value in
how it represented their group process. The shortcomings
of the instrument’s sound and sensors and the potential for
its parts to be recombined or reinterpreted, seemed to just
about balance frustration with motivation.
5.2 Exploring sound, gesture and materials
The workshop environment encouraged mixing a variety
of approaches including design, bricolage and performance.
The layout of materials across a long table inspired ideas
through visual survey, and their abundance and malleabil-
ity led to their combination and destruction as needed. Par-
ticipants were aided by not being attached to materialised
ideas, perhaps due to the familiarity and low cost of the
materials. This contrasts with circuitry-based workshops
where participants interacted in a cautious and apprehen-
sive manner [16]. The instrument parts were used and re-
purposed in surprising ways, sometimes ﬁctitious ones as
in G2’s instrument. Some groups distinguished between in-
strument parts and crafting materials, while others blurred
this line completely.
After initial disappointment with the instrument’s lack
of responsiveness, participants discovered stroking, hitting,
scraping, throwing, twisting, pulling, pushing, sawing, singing,
shaking, whacking, dropping and more. The hands-on way
of working oﬀered fast iteration of testing gestural ideas
and sharing and critiquing the results, to the extent that
many ideas were explored simultaneously. A notable pat-
tern of activity across groups was the curation of a portfolio
of gestures, which were continuously reﬁned as new mate-
rials were incorporated into the instrument. When demon-
strating their instruments to each other at the end of the
workshop, participants were not required to perform how-
ever this was vital to some groups. The outcomes indicate
that“making the instrument malleable” [1] is not only ap-
plicable in ﬁctional model-making scenarios.
5.3 Exploring collaborative process
One of the more surprising aspects of the workshop was
the diversity of collaboration it aﬀorded the participants,
as depicted by Figure 3. Even the more experienced partic-
ipants commented that this workshop oﬀered them a way
of working that their current practice and community does
not. There were no apparent barriers to dynamically conﬁg-
uring group organisation, roles and process, or any notable
friction between verbal and non-verbal communication, or
overtly performative or design-led activity. The workshop
facilitated participants to use their existing skills, experi-
ence and interests, or simply respond to what emerged,
without dividing labour in the group or enforcing rigid role
play. Exploring the design environment’s aﬀordances was
a shared experience across groups, as observing an idea
contributed to one’s own understanding. Some ideas were
felt to be collectively owned such as feedback. The envi-
ronment’s openness allowed diﬀerent collaborative styles to
emerge.
5.4 Suggestions for further investigation
To provide deeper evaluation of this workshop method, we
recommend a comparative approach with other tools and
methods. We perceive potential in further integration of
electronic and digital crafting materials and methods such
as e-textiles, paper electronics and live coding. Such mate-
rials could not only be more pragmatic, but also more open
and inclusive in terms of subjective exploration [25, 24, 21].
Since participants seemed to curate collections of gestures
in the workshop, amplifying this behaviour with tools for
rapid capture and comparison of gestural ideas could also
be a promising line of investigation.
6. CONCLUSION
285
The process of exploring gesture in digital musical instru-
ment design involves a complex interplay between what
an instrument can do versus what its creators and players
would ideally like it to do. Tools and methods often ad-
dress these issues through two styles of exploration; toolk-
its encouraging exploration through constraining actual in-
strument behaviour, and sketching and model-making en-
couraging exploration guided by imagination. While inde-
pendent exploration of these issues is beneﬁcial, we sought
to investigate the potential of supporting designers to ex-
plore them concurrently through a craft-inspired workshop
method. We found that reformulating an existing instru-
ment to have a modular mechanical structure and combin-
ing it with crafting materials enabled rapid, open explo-
ration of gesture. Groups also restructured the instruments’
form to suit their gestural ideas, and the group setting of
the workshop fostered diverse collaborative process. Fur-
ther investigation is needed to identify how this method
compares with those that inspired it, and where in a larger
scale design process it might be appropriate and eﬀective.
