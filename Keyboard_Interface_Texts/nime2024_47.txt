ABSTRACT
Musical interventions are becoming a more popular tool in
dementia care. Although the use of music is developing in
a range of contexts such as choirs, song writing groups, and
more specific therapies, these often rely on musical knowl-
edge or the expertise of facilitators. Limited tools are avail-
able which facilitate unguided musical experiences, foster-
ing agency for their users through musical creativity. We
present a workshop-based study exploring the use of a pro-
cedural music platform designed for those living with de-
mentia and cognitive decline. The paper takes a mixed-
methods approach, exploring a range of procedural pro-
cesses, and reviewing participant engagement during their
use. We demonstrate the use of the platform and high-
light its potential for engagement. We evaluate the tech-
niques implemented and demonstrate an inverse relation-
ship between operational complexity and interaction. We
conclude it is possible to facilitate engaging musical interac-
tions which foster agency and creativity while maintaining
rich and age-appropriate outputs.

1. INTRODUCTION
Dementia is a wide umbrella for a range of progressive con-
ditions which affect the brain. It poses a growing concern
for an aging population, with increasing challenges to mem-
ory, problem solving, cognitive function and decision mak-
ing, which are severe enough to affect everyday life. There
is a growing body of research which highlights the positive
impact sustained engagement with music can have on the
well-being of older adults [19, 20]; for those living with de-
mentia musical interventions have been shown to aid key
aspects such as the sense of self [1], and awareness of the
moment and memories of the past [18, 17]. Music and arts-
based activities play an increasing role [15] in therapy, pro-
viding vital non-pharmacological methods to support cog-
nition, communication, social connection, and well-being.
Implementations are wide, featuring social activities such
as choir singing [38, 50], the development of personhood
and memory function through song writing [30, 2, 11], and
opportunities to participate in creative music-making [17,
51]. Although music activities have the potential to foster
agency, Zeilig [58] notes that people living with dementia
are often seen as passive participants, or only able to offer
limited creative contributions.
We argue that many current approaches to balancing
these challenges in participation focus on selecting ‘basic’ in-
struments and situations for musical creativity (commonly
voice or percussion led [17, 51]). Although perhaps chosen
specifically for their simplicity to encourage greater acces-
sibility, this can have the effect of isolating people living
with dementia’s contributions to that of playing along in
a basic manner with music made by ‘experts’, limiting the
potential for agency and its transformational effects. The
magical transformations seen in people living with demen-
tia ‘coming alive again’ need to be seen as not ‘magical’,
but instead as the careful, responsive and concrete actions
that have been taken to best support people living with de-
mentia to reach their creative potential [13, 16]. For these
reasons, music and other creative arts activities, with their
ability to be enjoyed through to later stages of dementia,
need to be carefully considered in terms of their design and
affordances.
To address these challenges we have developed a proce-
dural composition platform designed to facilitate agency
for those living with dementia through unguided creative
musical interaction. This paper outlines a workshop-based
activity using the platform undertaken as part of a series
of sessions run at a dementia cafe hosted by a community
partner. We evaluate the use of the platform, a range of
procedural techniques that underpin its operation and the
potential it has for engagement.
2. RELATED WORK
2.1 Agency, Creativity and Music
Agency is often characterised as the sense of control or
ownership that an individual experiences over both an ac-
tion they take and its consequences [26]. The study of
agency frequently prioritises its language and cognitive com-
ponents, leading to the assumption that dementia, with its
impacts on language and memory, necessarily leads to a loss
in agency [8, 55]. Dementia research also more generally fol-
lows a biomedical deficit model, focusing on the skills lost
by people living with dementia and what they are no longer
able to achieve [14, 16, 31]. This deficit model contributes
to the social stigma that comes with a dementia diagnosis
[57], undermining the sense of worth, agency, and self of a
person living with dementia [12, 45]. This also affects them
on a societal level, where common social practices lead to
them increasingly being denied opportunities to contribute
to society in a meaningful way [47].
Contrasting this, research instead suggests that agency
is more complex than what fits within this deficit model
[46], and that people living with dementia continue to have
a strong sense of agency when given opportunities to do
so [41]. For instance, people with dementia are quite ca-
pable of demonstrating agency through their creative and
intentional abilities [33, 58]. There is growing evidence of
the value of arts-based activities in providing people liv-
ing with dementia opportunities to be active agents in their
own creative flourishing [17, 56]. Music contains open-ended
structures that can scaffold the creativity, playfulness and
feelings of togetherness in people living with dementia, while
also enabling their sense of agency by allowing them to mod-
ify these structures to match their desires and interests [46].
This openness nurtures inclusion and participation, gener-
ating feelings of agency, wellbeing, and the reinforcement of
a sense of self as grounded and belonging [58].
2.2 Accessible Musical Interaction
Within the scope of arts-based activities for dementia there
is much work and research focusing on accessible tools, with
a comprehensive overview provided by MacRitchie [39]. 51
technologies were reviewed, with 28 focused specifically on
musical interaction. The majority of these technologies (19)
targeted ‘music listening’, providing access to playlists and
simplified listening devices. 9 technologies focused on ‘music
making’: Kenning et al. [32], Smith et al. [51], and Dowlen
et al. [17] use rhythmic percussive instruments; Cheng et
al. [9, 10] and Han et al. [27] use a simialr tuned percussive
instrument (children’s glockenspiel); with Benveniste et al.
[6] and Bouley et al. [7] taking a more gamified approach,
using game controllers to interact with a computer-based
single note melody instrument. Although accessible, there
are limitations to the creative agency facilitated by such
tools and in most cases their simplicity hinders the richness
and maturity of their musical potential.
Within the NIME, SMC and ICMC communities the dis-
course around accessible musical instruments is well repre-
sented as reviewed by Frid [23, 24], and more recently Lucas
et al. [37] and Forster et al. [21]. Within this space there is
limited research focusing on dementia or cognitive decline,
the two exceptions being Favilla et al. [20] and Pigrem et
al. [40].
3. DESIGN METHODOLOGY
The goal for the platform designed for the workshops was to
enable creativity, and foster agency in meaningful and un-
guided musical interactions. From a physical perspective we
wanted to present an approachable device which promoted
interaction through materials and design factors, while sim-
plifying interaction and providing strong multi-modal feed-
back. From a functional perspective we were keen to test
and evaluate range of approaches to procedural composi-
tion. We also wanted to explore a range of complexity levels
to establish a relationship with cognitive load.
3.1 The Interface
The interface used in the research is known as the ‘Slid-
erBox’ (pictured below in figure 1) and was developed it-
eratively over a year working with groups of older adults
living with dementia in the Sheffield region. We presented
the device and 5 supporting design criteria at the NIME
2023 conference, reported in [40]. Powered by Bela [43] the
device is capable of standalone operation, however in this
part of the research serves as an ‘accessible MIDI controller’
(AMC) interfacing with the Ableton Live Environment.
The Interface is lasercut from wood and well finished
to facilitate an approachable and physically enticing de-
vice with which to inspire interaction. The potential for
material factors to guide and support interaction in digital
musical instruments has been explored by some within the
NIME community [25, 48, 49, 29] and has resonance with
more recent notions of entanglements in HCI [22, 4, 5]. The
Interface houses 8 analogue sliders and 8 momentary push-
buttons. Feedback is provided to the user through LED
lights in the buttons and LED light strips alongside each
slider. Basic gestalt grouping principles (colour and posi-
tion) are used to connect each slider, button and LED group
into a more singular unit for parameter control.
The Bela Mini handles sensor interaction and serves as
a MIDI device to connect to a computer. Following some
basic windowing and ‘debounce’ processes, interaction data
is converted to MIDI and passed as CC data. The Bela also
receives user feedback (sent again as MIDI CC data) which
is converted into an SPI message and passed to the LEDs
in real-time.

Interface, featuring 8 analogue sliders, 8 momentary buttons

3.2 Audio Playgrounds
Through our wider work with similar groups (to date over
40 activity sessions, engaging with over 500 participants
including activity coordinators, music therapists and care
professionals), the importance of a ‘mature’ and ‘aestheti-
cally rich’ musical output had been highlighted. Although
there was the possibility of impaired cognitive processing in
our participant group, the experience still needed to be ap-
propriate for the age of the participant, and designed with
the agency of the user in mind.
In order to facilitate rich musical interactions for those
with minimal or no musical training we developed the no-
tion of an ‘Audio Playground’ (AP). The playgrounds com-
bined a range of procedural techniques to facilitate the live
composition of a basic piece of music, which fostered the
potential for nuance and personalisation in its final form
and structure. Each techniques had to be navigable with a
single button press and a slider.
Beyond maturity of output, several key interaction factors
guided the design of the Audio Playgrounds:
• No ‘out of key’ notes: through our work and consulta-
tion to date the limitations of musical ability and its
effect on confidence and interaction has been noted.
We felt it relevant to limit the potential for dissonant
combinations of musical elements while working with
those without musical knowledge or training.
• Freedom in the rhythmical domain (within reason): It
was considered to discourage interaction if there was
noticeable latency between button presses and sound
events. In the case of the slider data there was no
quantisation, and in the case of the buttons interac-
tions were quantised to a 16th note grid in the Able-
ton environment. The quantisation value prevented
galloping and phased playback between parts while
enabling the level of synchronicity expected in west-
ern music.
• As agency in the musical experience was a key point of
interest, it was decided that each playground should
foster the potential for nuance in its form and struc-
ture. This was intended to enable greater connection
between participants and their musical interactions
and foster personalisation of experience.
• As technology can pose an increasing barrier for those
living with dementia its role in the process was hidden.
To provide an inclusive and accessible solution, screen,
mouse or keyboard based operations were removed for
the user.
Two Audio Playground sessions were developed. Both
sessions featured conventional instrumentation (drums, keys,
bass, melody, and percussion). AP1 was an upbeat track
with a straight 8 rhythm, driving bass-line, and keyboard
parts. AP2, in contrast, was a softer downbeat track with
a shuffled feel, featuring wistful piano motifs and contem-
plative chord changes. The musical parts in each Audio
Playground are displayed below in Table 1.
Each playground employed similar approaches to pro-
cedural composition. Sound playback included two main
paradigms - looped playback and one-shot. Four channels
of each playground facilitated continuous (looped) musical
content, with the nature and structure of the content chang-
ing with interaction. The remaining four channels facili-
tated one-shot playback with varying degrees of change with
each interaction. The rationale for these two paradigms was
to enable instant structure and musical context from the

looped elements, while providing space for discovery and
personalisation through development of the loops and addi-
tion of the one-shot samples. Due to the range of cognition
and dexterity within the group the playgrounds needed to
work for all ability levels, and in some cases with minimal
interaction.
All of the content for the Audio Playgrounds was pre-
composed. The looped channels played back 8 and 16 bar
MIDI files, with the one-shot channels using a mix of MIDI
files and round-robin sample banks. In order to ensure the
combinations were harmonious all pitched parts were played
in the same key, with the use of modal movement between
the parts to provide change in the mood of the piece as
the participants interacted. To simplify the process chord
tones and pentatonic scales were used to minimise ‘Fruity’
note combinations (scale clashes between different musical
parts).
3.2.1 Procedural Approaches
Two key procedural approaches were used in the Audio
Playgrounds: 1) follow actions in Ableton Live were used to
create a round-robin approach to the playback of different
pre-composed MIDI clips. A button press would step for-
ward to the next clip in the chain, which would loop until
another trigger message was received. 2) A random walk
was taken through a set of pitched samples facilitating a
random, yet harmonically coherent melody. In one case a
combination of both approaches was taken, where an arpeg-
gio played on a guitar was inverted to a random degree with
each button press. Although basic in approach, the tech-
niques enabled rich combinations of musical parts, which
were easily navigated into new harmonic spaces through in-
teraction. It was our goal to establish the potential for each
compositional approach and the role they play in future de-
velopment of the platform.
As memory and wider cognitive abilities are key chal-
lenges for those living with dementia we were particularly
interested in the relationship between the complexity of
each interaction and the frequency of engagement. Taylor
et. al. [53] evidenced a desire for greater complexity from
participants, however noted a subsequent decrease in enjoy-
ment when implemented through lower quantisation value
for temporal onset of stems (full bar / half bar / quarter
bar levels). We were interested in exploring this space in
greater detail to better understand the relationship between
complexity and cognitive challenge. Within each procedu-
ral approach a range of complexity levels was induced based
on the number of different ‘actions’ possible with that part.
For example: would a single button always trigger the same
part, or step between two (or three) possible options in a
round-robin. The complexity levels implemented are ex-
plored in greater detailing the following sections.
3.2.2 One Action
Single action operations facilitated a single musical change
for each button press. For example initiating the playback
of a one-shot sample or MIDI clip, or the incorporation of
a drum roll in to a looping drum part. The button press
always had a singular and repeatable effect on the musical
material.
3.2.3 Two Action
Two action operations facilitated one of two musical changes
for each button press. For example stepping between two
different MIDI clips (i.e. two different baselines or keyboard
parts). Unlike the single action operations the button press
would do one of two things - play part A or play part B
depending on what part was already playing.
3.2.4 Three Action
Three action operations facilitated three possible musical
changes for each button press. For example stepping be-
tween three different percussion parts, or three different de-
grees of inversion of a triad.
3.2.5 Five Action (randomised)
Five action operations were less predicable, with a wider
range of possible responses to a button press. Each Audio
Playground session featured one five action action control
which triggered an advancement of a random walk through
a set of glockenspiel (AP1) or vocal (AP2) samples. In each
case there were 5 equally weighted possibilities (each note
of a pentatonic scale).
The different procedural approaches used on each channel
of the two Audio Playground sessions are highlighted below

4. THE STUDY
The study was undertaken as part of a series of three work-
shops run in partnership with a local wellbeing organisation.
On visiting their regular fortnightly dementia cafe with pro-
totype devices (reported in [40]), attendees (a group of older
adults with varied abilities and disabilities) self-selected to
join a set of music-focused sessions. People attended with
their friends and loved ones, and were very clear that they
did not want to be separated into “those with dementia”
and “those without”, i.e. it was important for the activities
to be run for the group as a whole. Over the three work-
shops (held over four weeks) we explored a range of topics
and musically focused activities, mediated through digital
technologies. We used the Sliderbox (fig 1) on all three
occasions to playback music (wkshop 1), mix stems of pop-
ular music (wkshop 2), and to create new music (wkshop
3). This paper focuses on the third and final workshop and
an activity which used the Sliderbox to control the Audio
Playground sessions.
The nature of the sessions were very informal and the
focus was providing musical activities as opposed to more
controlled experimental conditions. Within this space our
research framework guided the design of the workshops and
the activities undertaken in each. All activities were un-
dertaken in a group environment with the group members
sitting around a large table. The activities across the three
workshops were designed to scaffold musical experiences
such that participants could increasingly develop agency
mediated through the device, and consider themselves as
active musical agents. The Audio Playground activity took
place at the end of this scaffolding process. The workshops
focused on one device in order for the participants to de-
velop familiarity with it, and any interactions observed in
the later workshops could be teased apart somewhat from
initial reactions to the device itself.
4.1 Participants
Eight participants joined the third workshop reported here
(M4, F4, 7 older adults, 1 middle-aged). The group was
made up of some living with dementia, some awaiting di-
agnosis, and their carers. Participants who had attended
previous sessions were familiar with the Sliderbox, however
it was the first time for all participants using the Audio
Playgrounds and interacting with unfamiliar and change-
able music. One participant self reported to be musical,
although unfamiliar with digital technology or procedural
composition.
4.2 Procedure
The Sliderbox was presented to the participants in a group
environment, who explored AP1 and then AP2. It should
be noted that this presentation approach would have con-
tributed to learning effects within the group (as highlighted
in [44]), however was concurrent with the naturalistic set-
ting of the workshops. Instructions were kept minimal to
ensure an unguided approach to interaction: `‘Press some
buttons, use some sliders. See what you like and how you
like it sounding” . Participant were asked to explore the
device and reassured there was no right or wrong way to
interact. If unsure the direction to ‘press some buttons and
explore the outcome’ was given. Participants were given the
choice to interact alone, or in a group of two so as to enable
and normalise support if needed (four participants chose to
undertake the task in a group of two: P5&6 and P7&8).
Interactions lasted between 4 and 5 minutes in duration for
each participant.
In order to record interaction, at the beginning of the ses-
sion a 360-degree camera was placed in the middle of the
table; the camera captured a continuous 360-degree image,
making it ideal for use in groups. Its size and appearance
were also factors in making sure the recordings were as un-
obtrusive as possible for the attendees. The camera cap-
tured the whole workshop and specific windows of interac-
tion during the study tasks were later exported for analysis
and coding.
4.3 Analysis
Following the workshop the 360-degree recordings of the
sessions were windowed to highlight each participant’s ac-
tions in the tasks. The exported files were windowed using
the following criteria: i) the beginning of an interaction was
initiated when one participant was either passed the de-
vice by another person (researcher or another participant),
or the participant pulled the device towards their body (or
positioned themselves closer to the device) in order to begin
using it, ii) the end of an interaction was signalled when the
device was moved by the participant to someone else in the
group (researcher or participant), or the device was moved
by the researcher on receiving a signal from the participant
that they had finished using it.
4.3.1 Interaction
Each unique interaction with the Sliderbox was noted. To-
tals were established for each interface element and later
used to establish patterns of interaction based on procedu-
ral approach and complexity level. The data was charted
using the Excel platform and is displayed and discussed in
the following section.
4.3.2 Engagement
Assessing engagement in a naturalistic setting can be chal-
lenging, and as researchers we often rely on later coding
and analysis of video data. As dementia is a complex and
degenerative condition several specific approaches to estab-
lishing engagements can be found ([36, 42, 28]). In order
to establish levels of engagement throughout the activity
for each participant, we used the Video Analysis Scale of
Engagement VASE [36]. The VASE provides a method to
establish engagement using a 7 point scale rating of four
key indicators of engagement: 1) facial expressions; 2) bod-
ily movements; 3) attention and awareness; and 4) emo-
tional response [35]. The VASE assessment process uses
an HTML based viewer enabling real-time annotation of
video data, later exported as a CSV file [34]. Traditionally
a mean average of the four indicators is taken to establish
a single figure engagement score for a particular partici-
pant. Although designed for more advanced dementia, the
four metrics were in our case relevant to the situation and
the scale wide enough to capture the spectrum of abilities
within the group.
5. RESULTS
All data collected as part of the study was a product of
analysis and coding of the 360 videos. Following the session
the video was reviewed and each participant’s interaction
windowed and exported as a separate video file. The video
files were reviewed and coded independently by authors JP
and JM.
5.1 Procedural Approaches
The use of both looping and one-shot procedural imple-
mentations were equally favoured, with both methods used
fairly evenly across the two Audio Playground sessions. The
looped channels were used in 48.21% and 51.32% of interac-
tions in AP1 and AP2 respectively. The one-shot channels
were used in 51.79% and 48.68% of interactions in AP1 and
AP2 respectively.
5.2 Complexity Measures
The number of unique button presses on each of the 8 chan-
nels was counted and its relationship to the varied complex-
ity measure established. The frequency of button presses
for each channel in the two Audio Playgrounds is displayed
below (figures 2 and 3) along side the level of interaction
complexity in each case.
Figure 2: Audio Playground 1: Relationship between Com-
plexity and Interaction
Figure 3: Audio Playground 2: Relationship between Com-
plexity and Interaction
In both Audio Playground sessions lower levels of com-
plexity in general resulted in a higher percentage of interac-
tion with that particular channel. The most used interface
element in both cases (CH4 and CH7 respectively) fostered
the lowest complexity level. The second most used inter-
face element in the case of AP1 (jointly CH3 and CH6)
also fostered lower complexity levels (1 and 2 actions re-
spectively). The second most used interface element in the
case of AP2 (CH5) was again of a lower level of complex-
ity (2 actions). In the case of more complex interactions
(CH1 of both sessions), the interface element has the lowest
engagement score in both AP1 and AP2.
The data suggests limiting complexity to one or two ac-
tion functions results in greater levels of engagement. It
should be noted that this was the first time any of the partic-
ipants had interacted with the platform, so potentially with
greater enculturation and learning time this may change for
some.
5.3 Modes of Interaction
During the analysis period two core modes of interaction
with the Audio Playgrounds were established: 1) range find-
ing; and 2) creative interaction. These modes underpinned
the nature of participant’s interactions with all participants
demonstrating one or both approaches. These modes of in-
teraction are explored in the following sections.
5.3.1 Range Finding
Most interactions began with a phase of range finding. Dur-
ing this stage participants explored the potential of the plat-
form by testing each button and slider. Although slightly
different in implementation for each participant, interac-
tion was generally more methodical with users working from
one side of the interface to the other. This mode was in-
dicated by more isolation button presses which were less
connected to the musical material playing and bolder in-
teractions which prioritised one musical part at time. The
goal of this stage for all seemed to be gaining familiarity
and exploring the potential for interaction.
5.3.2 Creative Exploration
In most participants (6/8) a particular shift in interaction
style occurred and choices become less about mapping and
discovering and more about creating and developing some-
thing new. This mode was indicated by more musically fo-
cused actions. Button presses were made more in time with
the track and other mix elements and slider movements be-
came more subtle and focused on mixing parts together as
opposed to creating clarity for singular parts. Navigation
across the device was less linear and more responsive to
changes in musical output. Facial expression became less
curious and more contemplative indicated by greater con-
centration and wider body and head movements in time to
the music and in response to changes made. Participants
returned to interface controls they had already tested and
made smaller and more refined changes based on surround-
ing interactions and developments in the piece.
5.4 Participant Engagement Score
To establish the VASE score for each participant, the video
for each participant’s activity with the Audio Playgrounds
was reviewed by two separate raters and engagement scores
established for the four metrics. There was minimal devi-
ation between raters (max=1.75, mean=0.91, SD=0.49 in
AP1 and max=1.86, mean=0.65, SD=0.54). The mean av-
erage of both raters has been published. Table 4 and 5
present the VASE score for each participant using the two
Audio Playgrounds.
5.5 Qualitative Feedback
Participants were encouraged to discuss their experiences
during every workshop, and after the audio playground tasks
were asked specifically for their thoughts. One participant
stated that the “concentration”the activity had encouraged
was remarkable. Another participant talked about liking
“being able to do it myself” and had mentioned this in the

context of having difficulty with computers. Another partic-
ipant said they “liked to mess about with [the sliders]” , and
likened it to being a DJ. The group setting of the activity en-
abled learning effects around the table, and an opportunity
to build off what the other participants had created. For
example, one participant mentioned “I was trying to pick
some of what <participant> was doing, and then something
from <another participant> and something from <another

6. DISCUSSION
This is a point in a longer exploration into the use of music
technology for those living with dementia, but one that has
provided a strong direction for future research. We believe
we have developed the beginnings of a platform which can
facilitate agency embedded into unguided creative decision
making, enabling greater access to musical expression for
those living with cognitive decline.
6.1 Procedural Approaches
Although basic, the approaches tested here were effective.
They enabled freedom for participants to navigate a range of
potential musical possibilities while being shepherded from
negative harmonic or melodic results. The balance of the
two approaches worked well to enable continuous musical
output while providing options for participants to person-
alise their experience.
The round-robin method enabled degrees of control mu-
sically, while facilitating a perceivable change in response
to interaction. The predictability inbuilt into the process
appeared to foster intentional autonomous choices on part
of the user in response to their creative decision making.
The random-walk method was less favoured, although
this maybe a factor of its implementation at this stage of
the research. The lack of predictability was noticed by most
participants, with some becoming sceptical about controls
that used it. Due to the use of a pentatonic scale, there was
some potential for dissonant combination with other mix el-
ements, and the five possible outcomes from a single button
press increased complexity leading to a notable reduction
in interaction.
In future implementations the round-robin method will
be favoured for the benefit of its inbuilt predictability. The
variability of the random walk method is considered to pose
a greater cognitive load, which presents more challenges to
those living with dementia.
6.2 Response to Complexity levels
Overall, we observe an inverse relationship between com-
plexity and interaction. Increases in complexity (either through
increasing invariability or operational complexity) result in
less interaction with a particular interface element and un-
derlying procedure. One and two action operations in this
case were most successful in promoting repeat interaction
across both Audio Playground sessions. In both cases three
and five action operations appeared to cause greater con-
fusion in participants and discourage further interaction.
This aligns with findings from [52] where requests for com-
plexity, realised through more freedom in timing, were met
with lower enjoyment levels. This denotes an area for fu-
ture research in finding ways to increase richness and exten-
sion in the musical experience without triggering a negative
response to complexity, a key design recommendation re-
flected by Pigrem et al. [40].
6.3 Modes of Interaction
The two modes of interaction explored (range finding and
creative engagement) highlight a particular shift in partic-
ipant interaction towards a more autonomous and embod-
ied experience. Similar approaches to discovery with a new
musical device were reported by McPherson et al. [44] in
relation to unguided learning. The two modes of interaction
we explore also find resonance with the notions of ‘divergent
exploration’ and ‘convergent honing behaviour’, highlighted
by Tubb [54]. This is an area of particular interest to our
research with minimal current work focused on facilitating
this agency or exploring its potential in musical interven-
tions designed for those living with dementia. This initial
proof of concept highlights space for greater exploration as
work within the community develops.
6.4 Engagement
In terms of engagement our data demonstrates the poten-
tial for such platforms in use with those living with demen-
tia. Although some of our participants were in the early
stages of their dementia, they remained engaged through-
out the workshop tasks, with engagement level increasing
throughout for most (6/8) participants in their second use
of the device (AP2). Although one participant had lower
engagement levels during the task, it was clear through con-
versation across all workshops that their interest lay more
in dancing rather than in controlling the music. They also
had a hearing impairment which may have affected how en-
gaging the audio playground material was for them. We are
keen to see how this relationship will develop further with
successive interactions.
As dementia is quite a unique and progressive disease, and
approaches to observing and quantifying the benefits of mu-
sical interventions are relatively new, we find ourselves with
minimal surrounding data with which to compare our re-
sults. In comparison with existing usage of the VASE scale
[36] the engagement scores we observed were high, with min-
imal challenging or negative behaviours observed. Through
continuing to assess using these approaches greater bench-
marks for performance can be established and comparison
and evaluation of progress will be possible.
7. CONCLUSION
To conclude, our research starts a conversation surrounding
the agency provided to those living with dementia through
musical interventions, and how factors such as creativity
and unguided exploration can be achieved. We demonstrate
the potential they have to foster independence and auton-
omy, and present and evaluate a platform to facilitate their
use. We hope sharing through this work with the commu-
nity, we can develop greater discourse surrounding dementia
and the need to design for cognitive decline.
8. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We would like to thank all those who have supported or
participated in our research to date, as well as the stake-
holders and community partners who make it all possible,
in particular for this study, Jo-Anne Levesley. This research
is funded by a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship to author

9. ETHICAL STANDARDS
The research has involved multiple stakeholders in consul-
tancy and involvement activities, as set out in [3]. Par-
ticipants were contacted through one of our community
partners, an established group in the community for peo-
ple living with dementia, and volunteered to take part in
our workshops. Information was provided in several ways
(print, talking through by a researcher and by a community
organiser) to facilitate the full participation of people living
with dementia. The participants provided their written in-
formed consent, and all published data is fully anonymous.
The research was reviewed and approved by the Departmen-
tal Ethics Committee at The University of Sheffield (United
Kingdom), reference 052547.
