ABSTRACT
Probatiois an open-source toolkit for prototyping new dig-
ital musical instruments created in 2016. Based on a mor-
phological chart of postures and controls of musical instru-
ments, it comprises a set of blocks, bases, hubs, and sup-
ports that, when combined, allows designers, artists, and
musicians to experiment with diﬀerent input devices for mu-
sical interaction in diﬀerent positions and postures. Sev-
eral musicians have used the system and based on these
past experiences, we assembled a list of improvements to
implement version 1.0 of the toolkit through a unique in-
ternational partnership between two laboratories in Brazil
and Canada. In this paper, we present the original toolkit
and its use so far, summarize the main lessons learned from
musicians using it, and present the requirements behind,
and the ﬁnal design of, v1.0 of the project. We also detail
the work developed in digital fabrication using two diﬀer-
ent techniques: laser cutting and 3D printing, comparing
their pros and cons. We ﬁnally discuss the opportunities
and challenges of fully sharing the project online and repli-
cating its parts in both countries.

1. INTRODUCTION
Probatio(Latin word for“test, experiment, trial” ), currently,
in its version 1.0, is a functional prototyping toolkit for cre-
ating digital musical instruments (DMI) [13]. Two main
questions guide its design:

• How to provide structured and exploratory paths for
generating new DMI ideas?
• How to reduce the time and eﬀort needed to build func-
tional DMI prototypes?
The ﬁrst question is related to the large number of com-
bination possibilities of inputs and outputs in the DMI con-
ception that can yield to creative paralysis [9]. The second
question addresses the plethora of skills that one should
possess to develop a functional prototype of a DMI.
We consider that, in the musical instrument design con-
text, the functional prototype is vital to perform a more ac-
curate evaluation of musical interactions as it immediately
allows for experimenting with the results of someone’s idea.
In short, Probatio “aims to provide designers with direc-
tions for conception, as well as to narrow the gap between
idea and prototype” [2, 3].
To address the ﬁrst question, Probatio embeds the con-
cept of instrumental inheritance [2], which is a collection
of physical structures or playing techniques that a new in-
strument “borrows” from existing instruments. Designing a
novel DMI then amounts to choosing postures and controls
from the morphological chart (cf. Figure 1).

ment inheritance [2]: splitting existing instruments
into parts and recombining them. Drawings by

About the second question, the system encapsulates tech-

nical details of physical structure, electronics, and program-
ming in the form of pre-deﬁned blocks and bases. These
parts allow designers, musicians, and artists to experiment
with postures and controls intuitively by just combining
pieces and experiment with the system’s response in real-
time and immediately obtain a functional DMI.
2. ORIGINAL TOOLKIT
In this section, we discuss the original Probatio toolkit, re-
visit the results of its evaluation with musicians and per-
formers [3, 2], and technical limitations that constrain a
broader use of this version.
In its version 0.2, Probatio consisted of thirteen blocks,
three bases, one hub, and multiple supports for holding
blocks in place. With the toolkit, the musicians could ex-
periment diﬀerent ways of controlling and holding the DMI
prototype (cf. Figure 2)1.
Figure 2: Example of a possible combinations of
blocks and bases in Probatio v0.2.
2.1 Evaluation of Earlier V ersions
Since its development, twenty-ﬁve musicians with diverse
backgrounds participated in evaluation sessions of Proba-
tio [3, 2]. The evaluation methods comprise video analysis
focusing on instrumental interaction analysis [8], compar-
ative questionnaires, interviews that were processed using
thematic analysis [1], and coding methods such as structural
coding and emotion coding [15]. One of the main results of
the qualitative analysis of data gathered in these sessions
was the emergence of three user proﬁles:
• Builder, who was interested in building each detail of
their instrument and who wanted freedom for choosing
sensors and placing them on desired speciﬁc positions;
• Experimenter, who demands rapid responses from the
system and focus on combining existing elements to
reach interesting interactive results;
• Virtuoso, who wants to develop playing techniques
with existing controllers.
Probatio seemed better suited for the experimenters. For
this proﬁle, the number of elements, and the toolkit’s fast
and straightforward connection appear as essential aspects.
Furthermore, the results of the quantitative evaluation pre-
sented an increase of cycles of mounting and testing when

using Probatio if compared to a generic sensor toolkit [2].
These results suggest that the use of a pre-deﬁned structure
and easy connections allowed for more cycles of experimen-
tation, which is welcome in creative prototyping.
This advantage nevertheless comes with a cost in the form
of the limited grid-style format of the base and the size of
the blocks, which both inﬂuence the minimum resolution
of the controls, i.e., how close together they can be placed,
as well as the pre-determined mapping and sound synthesis
possibilities in each block.
Furthermore, some physical features interfered in the pro-
duction time of blocks and bases. The assembly of bases
and blocks demanded artisan-detailed work, which made
the process long. This centralized high-skilled work resulted
in only a few blocks and bases being produced. This exac-
erbated production time directly aﬀected the diversity of
possible combinations.
The evaluation process also highlighted some system mal-
functions and technical bugs requiring the presence of a de-
veloper to correct these issues during the process. Thus,
it was not possible to allow for a more intimate use of the
toolkit by the participants since its use was restricted to a
time-limited session. We believe this limitation constrained
our understanding of the system’s creative and engagement
potential.
3. EXPERT PERFORMANCE WITH RES-
PONSIVE DEVICES
Despite its limitations, Probatio became a fundamental build-
ing block in the ongoing 5-year research project ” Respon-
sive Devices and Systems for Expert Musical Interaction” ,
led by Marcelo Wanderley and funded by the Natural Sci-
ences and Engineering Research Council of Canada which
addresses two main questions: a)how to design responsive,
reliable interfaces for musical interaction? and b) how do
musicians develop expertise in their interaction with such
novel interfaces?
The project is divided into three main steps:
• Design of proof-of-concept functional prototypes. Us-
ing Probatio, musicians are asked to choose interac-
tion metaphors and iteratively build functional pro-
totypes (cf. Figure 1). Musicians are interviewed at
each step of prototype development, and the designs
are cataloged in terms of the types of inputs used and
the primary musical interaction metaphors proposed.
• Development of advanced prototypes. Three to ﬁve
most innovative devices from the various prototypes
produced in the ﬁrst step will be re-created to present
a more organic integration of its various parts using
digital manufacturing technologies [7] and improved
gesture acquisition design [12].
• Evaluation of long-term musical interactions. In the
3rd step, musicians have the opportunity to perform
with the advanced prototypes for several weeks or
months, allowing them to develop and practice per-
formance techniques with the devices. A methodology
for the evaluation of musical interaction with the pro-
totypes is adapted from recent works, e.g., [6, 11, 14,
16], with the goal ofbetter understanding how musi-
cians develop long-term musical expertise with DMIs .
3.1 Collaborative Development
The eﬀort to build Probatio v1.0 is a collaboration be-
tween two universities of two countries in diﬀerent hemi-
spheres: Brazil and Canada. Diﬀerent from software devel-

opment, which can seamlessly be shared due to the imma-
terial essence of the code, online collaborative design, and
development of a physical and functional toolkit present
challenges. Thanks to digital fabrication techniques such as
laser cutting, 3D printing, and PCB manufacturing, digi-
tal representation of tangible artifacts can be shared online,
allowing cooperation from geographic distances, but many
assembly aspects remain to be solved locally. Therefore,
in order to keep the team at the same pace, all the steps
should be well documented and presented in a focal sharing
point website. Probatio project is open source and under
Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
4. PROBA TIO V1.0
Distinct from the previous version, where the objective was
to validate the idea of a toolkit for prototyping DMIs, our
goal with version 1.0 is to use the toolkit in the context
of DMI conception for reaching non-modular versions of
instruments that will be evaluated in longer periods with
musicians in diﬀerent countries, as explained in section 3.
4.1 Requirements for v1.0
Based on the project’s objective and the results from pre-
vious versions, we deﬁned the following requirements for
version 1.0:
1. Due to the collaborative nature of the project, the
toolkit’s fabrication must consider available materi-
als and manufacturing techniques in diﬀerent coun-
tries conforming to the same centralized model (for
instance, it is expected that blocks and bases made in
diﬀerent countries should work interchangeably);
2. Considering fabrication, the toolkit should be easily
assembled also easily adaptable to speciﬁc situations.
3. The system must be stable and, where possible, re-
cover from errors without compromising the user in-
teraction;
4. The system should still be plug-and-play and maintain
its quick and easy approach for combining blocks and
bases;
4.2 Physical Structure
In this section, we describe the architecture of Probatio
v1.0, as illustrated in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Probatio’s architecture, showing the var-
ious components of the toolkit v1.0.
Probatio-block. The basic element of interaction was in-
spired by control units of existing instruments in the form
of a quasi cube of 50 mm x 50 mm x 56 mm (lateral size,
depth, height) in its most basic realization. It encapsulates
the sensor(s) and the microcontroller (cf. Figure 4).
Figure 4: Example of an open block showing sensors
(two pots), microcontroller, and pogo-pcbs with
pogo pins.
Probatio-blocks translate user gestures into digital data
and transmits it through the communication bus. Magnets
ﬁx the blocks in place and force spring-loaded (pogo) pins to
be in contact with theprobatio-base. The pins are grouped
in a pcb-pogo, and each block has two boards (one for bot-
tom connections and one for side one). Blocks can assume
diﬀerent sizes following the rule of being multiples of 50mm
width x 50mm length. The height is constant at 56mm.
For instance, a2x2 probatio-block would measure 100mm x
100mm x 56mm.
Probatio-base. A component inspired by ways of holding
instruments and where the blocks sit, cf. Figure 5.
Figure 5: Examples of two bases.
The bases provide the fundamental structure of the built
prototypes. They expand the communication bus to their
slots, with rules of dimension similar to the blocks, and
allows the blocks to be connected vertically and laterally
(cf. Figure 6).
Figure 6: Assembly of blocks using a 1x3 base.
Note the vertical and lateral positions of the blocks,
which are kept in place by magnets in the block bot-
tom and the pcb-base.
Each slot is composed of a pcb-base (cf. Figure 7) that
expands the communication bus.

sensor data from each block via the I 2C serial communi-
cation protocol consolidates the data and transmits to the
computer through a serial connection.
Probatio-software. The computer-side piece of the sys-
tem is responsible for making the connection between the
physical toolkit with mapping software (e.g., libmapper [10]
clients such as webmapper [17]) and sound-related programs
such as Digital Audio Workstations, Virtual Studio Tech-
nology.
4.3 Materials and Digital Fabrication
We developed the previous version of Probatio using laser
cutting with medium-density ﬁberboard (MDF). The bene-
ﬁts of engineered MDF include low cost, consistent dimen-
sions across the axes, and rigidity. However, due to health
safety issues in some countries, this material is not recom-
mended for laser cutting due to the emission of formalde-
hyde [5], so new fabrication strategies had to be devised for
version 1.0.
In terms of digital fabrication, laser cutting is based on
2D subtractive manufacturing, in which Z-axis details are
constrained by the material thickness. This is often exces-
sively limiting for designing objects.
4.3.1 PLA and plywood
Based on the limitations of MDF, we decided to use 3D
printing as our primary digital fabrication technique and
polylactic acid (PLA) as the standard material. Although
3D printing is a slower manufacturing process when com-
pared to laser cutting, it can reproduce, with adequate levels
of resolution, the details modeled in a CAD or digital proto-
typing software. Concerning the material, PLA has become
popular in the 3D printing community because it is in the
class of biodegradable plastics and presents good ﬁnishing
quality and strength. Due to its popularity, good quality
PLA is available in many countries with consistent printing
properties along with aﬀordable printer costs.
Although we are using 3D-printed PLA as our primary
material, we consider that there is an essential cultural
hook that is associated with wooden pieces with existing
instruments, and this resemblance and aesthetics could res-
onate with musician users’ expectations. Therefore, we have
also experimented with laser cutting of plywood. For that
matter, the previous MDF-version models were adapted
to 3D models using digital prototyping software such as
AutodeskTMFusion 360.
Figure 8 presents the sketch of a 3D-printed block that
relies on four snap ﬁts on the inner sides to ﬁx the top
and the bottom parts together. To close the blocks made
of MDF or plywood, we rely on gluing the parts together,
which makes the maintenance diﬃcult. On the other hand,
using 3D printed snap ﬁts, we can easily update the blocks.
Figure 8: Sketch of the 3D printed block with snap
ﬁts positions and handles.
4.3.2 P arametric design
In parametric design, the designer deﬁnes a set of rules that
guide the model generation. By manipulating numerical pa-
rameters, one can obtain diﬀerent instances of a certain class
of objects. This versatility resides in the middle ground be-
tween conforming to standards and also allowing for adap-
tation for speciﬁc necessities. For collaboration, it is vital
to maintain the centralized model between the teams and
also to allow adaptation for speciﬁc needs, for example, the
number of sensors or sensor sizes. Therefore, parametric
design suits our project well since we expect that blocks
and bases designed in diﬀerent countries should work inter-
changeably. In version 1.0, it is straightforward to change
the dimension of blocks and bases (cf. Figure 9), and also
generate diﬀerent block tops.

5. EXAMPLES OF V1.0 BLOCKS AND AS-
SEMBL Y
So far, we have designed seven diﬀerent blocks presented in
Figure 10. From top to bottom, left to right, the blocks are
the following:crank, implemented with a rotary encoder;

dual pistons , continuous spring-loaded buttons using hall
eﬀect sensors and magnets; dial disc , also using a rotary
encoder; tap, built attaching a piezo on the inner top wall;
joystick, one potentiometer for horizontal axis and another
for vertical axis; dual pots , two rotary potentiometers with
knobs; dual buttons , two momentary buttons (the only dis-
crete value block, with the top of the block color-coded in
orange). All the blocks have been modeled and are ready for
3D printing. The assembly process is fully documented, so
they can be easily replicated. For more information related
to the project, refer to its website2 and repositories 3.

right upper row: crank, dual pistons, dial, dual but-
tons (in orange). Bottom row: piezo tap, joystick,

Finally, Figure 11 presents an assembly with both 3x3
and 1x3 bases containing the above mentioned seven blocks
and dummy blocks used for structural support only. We
deﬁned a color code by using red tops for blocks with con-
tinuous inputs, orange for discrete inputs, and grey tops for
structural blocks (i.e., dummy blocks).

blocks. Red blocks provide continuous inputs, the
orange one hosts two discrete buttons. Grey blocks
are dummy blocks to keep the structure in place.
6. CONCLUSIONS
This paper introduced version 1.0 of the Probatio toolkit for
prototyping digital musical instruments. After reviewing
2http://probat.io
3https://github.com/probatio
the goals and design choices behind the original toolkit, we
reported on the use of the previous version by 25 musicians,
highlighting the three main proﬁles of users as well as the
usefulness of Probatio as a tool to foster experimentation if
compared to generic sensor toolkits.
We then discussed in detail the requirements and the
inter-institutional, international collaboration in the imp le-
mentation for Probatio v1.0. The needs for a clear speciﬁca-
tion of manufacturing and assembly were put forward, de-
rived from its use as a building block in a long-term project
to understand the development of musical expertise with
DMIs.
We believe that this interdisciplinary project will be es-
sential to carry out longitudinal studies on the development
of musical expertise with DMIs. This kind of long-term
study is seldom attempted given the diﬃculty in ﬁnding
motivated performers to spend the required time to develop
expertise, the elusive notion of expertise itself, the multi-
faceted nature of digital devices, and the fast evolution of
technology and its impact on performance. With tools like
Probatio, we expect to contribute to reducing the time and
eﬀort from ideas to a working DMI prototype, helping the
overall study process.
