ABSTRACT
This paper presents insights and findings from an experi-
mental dance workshop conducted with the Magical Musi-
cal Mat (MMM), an interactive instrument that amplifies
physical touch with sound. The workshop, held as part
of the exploratory phase for a larger performance project,
aimed to explore the creative possibilities of the MMM in
the context of dance performance. The workshop brought
together two dancers versed in contact improvisation to col-
laboratively experiment with the MMM as both a musical
instrument and a choreographic tool. The workshop high-
lighted the MMM’s potential to facilitate expressive inter-
actions between dancers, revealing possibilities for collabo-
rative creativity in interdisciplinary contexts.

1. INTRODUCTION
Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) are often used to facil-
itate collaborative creative expression for broad audiences,
and much attention has been given to the design of systems
for this purpose. Many new musical instruments created for
novices focus on creating playful, social interactions rather
than on musical output [12]. Such instruments often trans-
fer some musical agency from the participants to a com-
puter. In these systems, limiting the participants’ musical
control lowers barriers to participating in collective expe-
riences [2]. Two aspects of control in DMIs influence user
experience: instrument efficiency and control intimacy. In-
strument efficiency refers to the ease of transferring input
gestures to outputs [10]. Control intimacy describes the
extent to which subtle variations in input gesture express
notable changes in sound outputs.

Often, restricting control means that users quickly hit the
upper limits of creative expression for a given DMI. High
skill ceilings are a desirable characteristic of DMIs, and the
tradeoff between control and skill ceiling is a key design con-
sideration in the development of DMIs [15]. We find that
introducing professional dancers (who are novices in music-
making) to an existing DMI, the Magical Musical Mat 1
(MMM), serves to raise its skill ceiling since the dancers
bring a high degree of skill and experience in body expres-
sion to their interactions on the MMM. The system’s low
latency and sensitivity contribute to a high degree of effi-
ciency when interacting with the MMM. Furthermore, the
dancers have a large amount of control over their movement
expression, granting them more control intimacy with the
MMM.
The MMM is a DMI for collaborative music-making that
translates interpersonal touch interaction into musical sounds.
It was designed with accessibility in mind, in a process that
centered non-speaking autistic children [5]. It went through
multiple design cycles that considered the MMM’s layout,
materiality, and technical constraints. Later iterations were
evaluated through Integrated Play Groups at an autism
clinic. Acknowledging that spoken word is inaccessible to
some students, the creators of the MMM were interested in
uplifting diverse interaction modalities to give participants
equal access to expression through interaction. See [4] for
more discussion of the MMM’s design process.
The MMM is made up of two conductive mats. When two
participants stand on each mat and make contact with each
other, the changes in contact resistance between their bodies
are processed to generate sounds. The original MMM design
utilized the Bare Conductive Touchboard’s built-in MIDI
synthesizer, and it operated in several different modes. A
variety of modes were created to explore the range of in-
teractions that the MMM could facilitate. These included
mappings from resistance to pitches played on a MIDI piano
and a mode where each new touch interaction triggered a
percussive sound.
This work represents the first time the MMM’s capabili-
ties have been explored in the context of dance performance.
The MMM naturally lends itself well to contact improvisa-
tion, an improvisatory dance practice where dance partners
move together in contact. Contact improvisation calls for
a “focus on relational aspects of movement” [7]. Practition-
ers communicate information about their movement to their
partners through touch [13]. The MMM can serve to enrich
touch interaction between dance partners, which extends
their somatic awareness. This kind of added sensory infor-
mation in multimodal systems can help dancers break out
of habitual movement patterns, allowing for greater creative
freedom [9].
Digital Dance and Music Instruments (DDMIs) facilitate

or augment dance performance [14]. Then often use muscle
sensors, inertial sensors [11], and/or motion-tracking tech-
nology [9, 6] to capture body movements that are then
mapped to sounds. While many DDMIs emphasize part-
nership between dancers and musicians [8, 1], few DDMIs
focus on the unique considerations of partnered dance. One
notable example is Interactive Tango Milonga (ITM), an
interactive dance system built around Argentine tango and
social dance [3]. ITM serves to foster intimacy and connec-
tion between dancers. As the dancers learn the mappings
between their movement and sound outcomes, they develop
a more acute perception of their partner’s movements. ITM
uses sound and movement to facilitate connection and com-
munication between dance partners.
In this paper, we discuss expanding the MMM’s scope
to encompass additional forms of collaborative creative ex-
pression. Specifically, we reimagine the MMM as a platform
for contact improvisation. We seek to answer the following
questions:
• How can DMIs be utilized in broader interdisciplinary
creative contexts, and what are the implications of
such collaborations?
• What aspects of interactive systems like the MMM in-
fluence the process of collaborative music-making and
movement exploration?
2. DESIGN OVERVIEW
The MMM operates in several different “palettes” or modes
that define different touch-to-sound mappings. For the per-
formance context, we adapted the MMM to run on an Ar-
duino Leonardo and act as a MIDI controller, sending MIDI
messages over USB to a laptop. Sounds are generated with
Ableton Live and Max/MSP. The audio was played over an
external speaker. For the workshop, the MMM’s conduc-
tive surfaces were made of two yoga mats with strips of foil
(Figure 1).
Figure 1: Dancers using the MMM.
In developing sound design for performance with the MMM,
we wanted to create a diverse array of sonic palettes suit-
able for a dance performance to seed the dancers’ experi-
mentation. Prior work with the MMM has shown that each
different palette inspires different movement vocabularies
[5].
We used many of the MMM’s original MIDI mappings
and further processed them in Ableton. Examples of these
included mappings from contact resistance to:
• Chromatic pitches
• Chord tones that change over time
• Trills or sustained notes based on length of contact
Leading up to the workshop, we tested different Spitfire
Audio instruments and MIDI plugins like arpeggiators and
snap-to-scale settings. We also introduced new sonic mate-
rial including field recordings, poetry narrations, and pop
songs and played them unprocessed or as source material for
MIDI granulators. Ultimately, we aimed to create palettes
that were evocative and engaging for both the dancers and
an audience.
3. METHODS
3.1 Participant Background
Two professional dancers experienced in contact improvisa-
tion, Laura and Rafael, were invited to a three-day work-
shop hosted by the authors to explore the MMM in the con-
text of dance performance. Laura was a female dancer and
choreographer based in the United States with training in
contemporary dance and hip-hop. Rafael was a male dancer
and choreographer based in Italy with training in contem-
porary dance. Laura and Rafael were both in the age range
of twenty to twenty-nine years, and they self-identified as
non-musicians.
3.2 Workshop Structure
The workshop was the first of a series of workshops planned
to lead toward a staged dance performance centering the
MMM. It was the dancers’ first time interacting with the
MMM, and their first time dancing with one another. We
also invited a cinematographer to videotape the interactions
and document the experience.
We introduced each new palette to the dancers without
explanation. Instead, we let them learn about each palette
experientially. The workshop was otherwise collaborative,
as the authors and the dancers jointly which palettes to
work with and how to modify them. At the end of the
workshop we conducted a semi-structured interview with
both dancers. We asked questions about their expecta-
tions, motivations, and partner dynamics. We conducted
thematic analysis on the transcripts, with a focus on iden-
tifying mechanisms that activated or sustained creativity.
We also reviewed the workshop footage and conducted the-
matic analysis to distill the major categories of interaction
the dancers engaged in. The analysis results have been cu-
rated into a set of studies that we introduce in a short film
that documents the workshop 2. Table 1 offers examples of
the factors that contributed to creative, varied movement
activity during the workshop.
4. RESULTS
4.1 Creative Mechanisms
It was creatively generative for participants to think about
approaching the MMM as a site for play. During the inter-
view, Laura expressed that a sense of playfulness empow-
ered her to explore different qualities of touch gesture on the
mats, like tapping and brushing, beyond those often used
in contact improvisation.
The dancers’ experimentation process involved coming up
with improvisation tasks that constrained various aspects of
movement and interaction. Some examples of improvisation
tasks are included in Table 1.
At the end of the workshop, Rafael reported feeling more
like a composer than a dancer at many points, as he created

Factor Examples Dancer Quotes
Choreographer
as composer • One dancer “played” the MMM alone while the
other danced outside the mats
• The dancers remixed a recording of a poem
through contact on the MMM, adding their
own pauses and emphasis
L: “I got to a place where it was more like
composing the world, and that included both
dance and music”
R: “I’m composing music for her, she’s moving
in a certain way. Let’s try to repeat the sound
or let’s try to make a rhythm. Let’s see if she
follows”
Playfulness
• The dancers engaged in a thumb war together
• The dancers feigned being shocked when
staticky sounds played
L: “[playfulness was] super present. . . it factored
into how I was approaching it, just more
freedom to explore different qualities“
Finding
origins of
movement • One dancer positioned the other’s limbs by
touching her joints
• The dancers moved their bodies away from
each point of contact
R: “it really puts you in the place where you
don’t look for movement, you just look for the
thing that generates movement [. . . ] like I do
this movement because I press her”
Partnering
• The dancers mirrored each other’s movements
• The dancers closed their eyes and
communicated through touch and sound
R: “The partnering experience, it also puts you
in the place of how much am I doing? [...] How
much should I be there or not? Or maybe how
much I should not think anymore and just go?”
L: “It was really beautiful to have the mat
because it brought it back to that [...] human
relationship. [...] Rather than, okay, we’re going
to do this specific lift.”
rhythms or drew out sound he found especially interesting
on the mats. Eventually, Laura and Rafael found that the
MMM would also function if just one person on the mats
bridged them making skin contact with both of them. From
this realization, a new interaction mode emerged, as one
dancer acted as composer/musician on the mats and the
other danced in response to the sounds generated outside
the mats.
4.2 Sonic Exploration
The dancers’ behavior was also heavily influenced by the
sonic material we presented to them. Sounds like drum kit
samples resulted in percussive movements, such as tapping
noses together. One of the palettes used slowly-evolving
organ sounds in a looping chord progression that started and
stopped as the dancers touched and let go. This inspired
slow and drawn-out movements, with little break in contact
to avoid pausing the chord progression.
We developed a palette that turned the mats into an
on/off switch, pausing and resuming playback of a recorded
sample. We recorded Laura and Rafael reciting a poem to-
gether, and used it as material for the new palette. When
Laura and Rafael tried out this palette, they reacted to the
poem’s content, for example lying down on their respective
mats after a line about sleep. Afterward, they reported
being frustrated by the lack of immediacy in sound produc-
tion with this mode; when the natural pauses in speech ran
counter to their previously established expectations about
the cause-and-effect relationship between touch and sound.
4.3 Affordances of Touch-Based Interaction
The MMM is distinct from many DDMIs in that sound is
borne out of touch rather than movement. Rafael expressed
that this changed his improvisatory process from looking for
movement to looking for the source of movement, which is
often contact and pressure, since these aspects of dance were
reinforced by the MMM’s sounds.
This was especially evident in the dancers’ experimenta-
tion with an electricity-inspired palette. In this palette, the
sounds with a short speech sample run through a granu-
lator. The result was a staticky sound that suggested the
energy of an electrical shock. When exploring this palette,
the dancers established an improvisation task where they
moved fluidly in their own space and feigned being electro-
cuted when they happened to touch. This task established
an explicit cause-and-effect relationship between action and
resulting movement, which built up a strong sense of antic-
ipation leading up to each touch event.
5. DISCUSSION
As we worked toward a broader vision for the MMM, we
found that bringing the DMI into an interdisciplinary con-
text broadened its possibilities for creative expression. Ex-
ploring the dancers’ creative processes bettered our under-
standing of how the MMM can effectively be used as a per-
formance tool. Organizing movement experiments around
improvisation tasks clarified the effects of various constraints
on the performance experience.
The dancers were also in unfamiliar territory as they
shared the role of musician/composer. This meant they ap-
proached movement-making in new, expansive ways. The
unique affordances of the MMM as a touch-based instru-
ment enable dancers to cultivate a deeper awareness of their
physicality in relationship to one another. It was important
to create conditions that fostered connection between the
dancers, and amplifying touch in a contact improvisation
setting helped in this respect.
Unfamiliarity was an important factor in creative explo-
ration during the workshop. Allowing the dancers to ex-
plore the MMM without much guidance while interacting
with each new palette allowed for sustained engagement as
the dancers experimented with gesture. Establishing play-
fulness as a guiding principle during the workshop had the
same effect, as it empowered the dancers to freely experi-
ment with diverse qualities of movement.
6. CONCLUSION
Exploring the MMM in the realm of partnered dance and
collaborative music-making provides valuable insights into
the interdisciplinary creative expression. Through a three-
day experimental workshop with professional dancers ex-
perienced in contact improvisation, we witnessed the po-
tential of the MMM as both a musical instrument and a
choreographic tool. Participants’ reactions and feedback
highlighted the significance of open-ended exploration and
playful experimentation in unlocking the creative potential
of the MMM within the context of dance performance.
