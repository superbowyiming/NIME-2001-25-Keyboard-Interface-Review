ABSTRACT
This paper introduces a Digital Musical Instrument (DMI)
that inscribes a linear and a circular conception of time, in-
spired by W estern and Eastern time philosophies. The DMI
employs two 3D-printed boards equipped with ESP32 chips
for wireless communication and WS2812 LEDs providing
visual representation feedback, and interactive boxes, each
fitted with a light sensor and ESP32 Mini boards. Such
interface is designed to be coupled with a software counter-
part for sound generation. The project originates from a col-
laboration with two composers from diverse cultural back-
grounds - one Chinese and one Italian. Through collabora-
tive design and co-composing practice, the proposed DMI
emerged as an epistemic tool, promoting cultural under-
standing and critically highlighting the socio-cultural role
of technology . Through such process, the significance of
rediscovering time in contemporary globalization and phi-
losophy was explored, challenging the conception of time as
a mere measurement parameter and striving to reveal the
importance of understanding the role of time across differ-
ent cultural contexts. This project wishes to expand the
constitutive role of musical time, demonstrating its diver-
sity and prompting a reflective layer of the perception of
performative and musical time in NIME.

1. INTRODUCTION
Being both a cultural artifact and temporal art, music en-
codes distinct philosophies of time. W estern traditions,
shaped by teleological narratives of progress and eschatol-
ogy , tend to prioritize linear structures in music [ 38, 12].
Conversely , Eastern traditions, rooted in cyclical concepts
of rebirth and natural recurrence, manifest in music through
recursive forms [ 15]. These temporal frameworks are not
merely aesthetic choices but embodied cultural epistemolo-
gies iways of knowing time through sound.
Although recent NIME research has enriched the dis-
course on time [40, 37, 35, 23], only two recent NIME papers
directly engage with cultural time perspectives. Recently ,
Tindale and Clark critiqued grid sequencers and proposed
an ansiorhythmic grid with dynamic subdivisions to better
reflect the fluidity and diversity of musical time [ 40]. In
contrast, Reid and colleagues explore temporal perception
through the MIGSI trumpet, an augmented instrument that
employs sensors and real-time DSP to challenge linear time
and reconsider the perception of musical time in performa-
tive musical practice [ 37].
Understanding how temporal conceptions embedded in
instrument design may influence compositional choice and
cultural narratives remains overall overlooked. This leads
to a number of questions that we want to examine with this
paper. If instrument design mediates temporal frameworks,
how do these structures shape composers ncreative deci-
sions? Moreover, what cultural narratives emerge when mu-
sicians co-compose with instruments that foreground time
as a malleable, charged parameter?
This project seeks to explore these intricate dynamics by
integrating a conception of time into a novel Digital Mu-
sical Instrument (DMI) that we called oO ၂” - from the
English characters O and the Chinese ၂, pronounced oyi” .
The interface ns design metaphorically incorporates dual
time representations - a linear and a circular boards paired
with nine light-sensor embedded cubes, sending messages
via OSC1 to control sound algorithms.
The original interest in investigating time came from the
first author who originally designed the instrument. T wo
composers with different cultural backgrounds (one Italian
composer, and one Chinese, authors 2 and 3 respectively)

were involved - they informally knew about the idea and
were keen to explore the relationship with time considering
their different musical perspectives. Thus, the project un-
folds as a multi-movement co-composition. By working on
composing with the instrument, we wanted to explore this
intimate relationship between entangled time and composi-
tional ideas.
Using the DMI, the two composers freely choose their
preferred platform for implementing their musical system,
aligning with their usual practice. Throughout the creative
process, the entire team adopted an autobiographical ap-
proach [ 33], documenting the experiences through diaries,
notes, and recorded conversations - a common practice in
many NIME research (e.g. [ 8, 10, 36]). This approach re-
sults in a collection of time-informed musical works, ac-
companied by reflective diary archives. Within the auto-
biographical frame, we opted to use Reflection-on-Action
[32], an approach that allow researchers to reflect on their
practice afterward. As such, we chose not to interfere with
the compositional processes, focusing instead on post-hoc
self-analysis.. Such process revealed key insights into the
interplay between the DMI, the composers, and the tempo-
ral dimensions of music. Finally , we discuss the reflection
emerged through this epistemic tool, highlighting the en-
tangled dynamics that emerged during the co-composing
activity .
This research explores how instrument design not only
reflects but also actively produces cultural understandings
of time, looking at how DMIs reshape our perception of
musical time, fostering deeper engagement with temporal
and collaborative cultural narratives. Ultimately , this work
seeks to bridge NIME ns technical focus on temporal repre-
sentation with broader questions of cultural influence and
social meaning, expanding the constitutive role of musical
time by showcasing its diversity , and encouraging a reflec-
tive approach to its perception in performative practice.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Cultural Conceptions of Time
Conceptions of time have varied across cultures and histor-
ical periods. Rooted in eschatological thought and Enlight-
enment progress narratives, W estern cultures have viewed
time as linear, goal-oriented, and culminating in an end-
point [12, 1]. This idea traces back to ancient Greek philoso-
phy (Heraclitus) and extends through Christian and modern
thought. The modern W estern conception of time, which we
referred to in this paper, centered on measurable and tech-
nical understandings, has been dominant in shaping societal
structures and individual experiences [34]. Albeit such view
being overall predominant, it is still worth noticing that
scholars also recognized nonlinear conceptions in W estern
traditions, as demonstrated through graphical timelines by
Rosenberg as well as Gell [ 38, 12].
In Eastern cultures, particularly China, time has tradi-
tionally been conceived as cyclical, emphasizing recurrence
closely tied to natural rhythms like lunar cycles and sea-
sonal changes [ 43]. Chinese philosophy views time as a dy-
namic, interconnected process. T exts like the I-Ching [39]
and Daoist and Confucian philosophies emphasize the flu-
idity and interdependence of time, space, and nature [ 43].
Jullien explores how Chinese thought diverges from W est-
ern frameworks in his work Du T emps[19], highlighting the
lack of verb tenses in the Chinese language, which reflects
a less rigid and more holistic view of time.
2.2 Musical Conceptions of Time
W estern music traditions also emphasize linearity , evident
in established forms such as the Sonata or the Minuetto,
where harmonic resolutions and motifs drive the musical
discourse toward a perceived endpoint [ 20]. Structural pro-
gression reinforces the temporal flow which aligns with tele-
ological narratives of developement. F or instance, Husserl
explored how melodies unfold temporally , linking musi-
cal structure to time perception [ 18]; Kramer distinguishes
omusical time p- a self-contained framework - from abso-
lute, linear time, underscoring music ns capacity to tran-
scend daily temporality [ 21]. On the contrary , eastern
musical traditions prioritize cyclical time. Improvisational
oral practices and recursive forms (e.g. Gamelan [2] and
Japanese taiko [11]) embody this cyclicality . Chinese music
intertwines with natural cycles and cosmology , as seen in
Y ue Ling(ᄅ਷) [24], which assigns seasonal tones, blending
philosophy and artistry .
While musical time concepts often align with W estern lin-
earity or Eastern cyclicality , cultural traditions resist rigid
binaries: for instance, Chinese opera blends linear narrative
progression with malleable, subjective temporal flows [5, 6];
W estern cyclicality often emerges in minimalist works, e.g.
Steve Reichns Piano Phase or T erry Riley’s In C .
2.3 Composition as Cultural Technology
Magnusson presents Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) as
oepistemic tools”, emphasizing their role in shaping knowl-
edge and creativity [ 25]. In his conversation with Molitor
Figure 2: Layout and Design
[30], he challenges the dominance of traditional W estern
music technologies and advocates for the inclusion of diverse
cultural expressions. By integrating non-W estern concep-
tions of time and cultural practices into the design and use
of DMIs, NIME research can more fully reflect the global
diversity of musical creation (ibid.).
Building on this discussion, studies in NIME argue that
technology is not a universal commodity but is shaped by
regional practices and cosmologies. Initiatives such as the
LA T AM NIME Network2 support this view by offering plat-
forms for sharing context-specific resources and collabora-
tive practices that challenge dominant Eurocentric models.
This is further exemplified by Kuzminns work on cosmotech-
nics, linking technical creation with local environments and
cultural narratives [ 22].
3. O- , A TIME INSTRUMENT
T o explore the relationships between time conceptions in-
scribed into a DMI, we developed a hardware interface that
explicitly represent different time conceptions. The original
design was conceived by the first author, and the musical
mechanisms were fine tuned during the compositional pro-
cess, described later, along with two composers (authors 2
and 3).
The interface is composed of two boards: one circular -
oO”, and one linear -o၂”, metaphorically reflecting Eastern
philosophies and W estern teleological perspectives, respec-
tively . 3D-printed chassis enclose a custom designed PCB
with WS2812 LED strips, and harnesses ESP32-WROOM-
32 chips for Wi-Fi-enabled control functionalities, allowing
for real-time adjustments.
Central to the technical architecture of this DMI are nine
interactive boxes, each outfitted with an LDR sensor, meant
to act as triggers/controllers when illuminated by lights
from the boards. The boxes utilize either an ESP32 Mini
board or a Xiao ESP32 sense, powered by individual bat-
teries, facilitating portable and responsive interactions.
T raditionally , a DMIs is composed of an hardware con-
troller and a software synthesizer counterpart [ 7]; the core
of our design is oriented towards the former, while we cre-
ate the audio platforms afterwards, together with the com-
posers, according to their own preferences and workflow (see
Section 4).

3.1 Time Boards
The PCBs design follows a modular approach to facilitate
easy assembly and disassembly , ensuring long-term adapt-
ability - a key consideration for longevity and sustainability
in NIME instrument design [ 31, 29].
F or both boards, we implemented a brightness control
using a sliding potentiometer allowing for precise control.
The brightness modulation is achieved through Pulse Width
Modulation (PWM) output from the ESP32 microcon-
troller, dynamically adjusting the WS2812 LED strip. In
the current prototype, a sliding switch is used to toggle
the boards, with the ESP32 detecting input via its GPIO
pins to control the WS2812 strip. Finally , as an arbitrarily
choice, we 3D-printed O with a semi-transparent Polylactic
acid (PLA), enhancing the visibility of internal lighting ef-
fects and allowing for a diffuse light, and ၂ in solid gray
PLA to produce segmented, concentrated light. (Fig. 1).
3.1.1 "O"
The circular PCB layout is designed to centralize all crit-
ical electronic components on the main board (ESP32-
WROOM-32, WS2812, battery , and brightness adjust-
ment). Surrounding this core, three additional circular
boards house LEDs only , with each module containing two
lights, with a total of eight evenly distributed LEDs. The
structure follows a concentric design with an inner ring di-
ameter of 50 cm and an outer ring diameter of 56 cm. The
3D-printed enclosure adopts a traditional Chinese dovetail
joints technique, (Fig. 2).
3.1.2 " ၂"
The linear PCB layout follows the same centralized design
as the circular one. It consists of two modules with a length
of 70 cm, each containing seven evenly distributed LEDs,
totaling 14 lights across a 140 cm structure. The casing, like
the circular version, is 3D-printed and utilizes a traditional
dovetail joint design, ensuring durability and easy reconfig-
uration while adapting to the linear form factor (Fig. 2).
3.2 LDR Cubes
W e also design nine interactive boxes, each incorporating a
single LDR sensor, an ESP32 Mini board or Xiao ESP32
Sense, and a rechargeable lithium battery . Boxes commu-

nicate with the computer via OSC messages. T o ensure
eﬀicient power management, each box includes a charging
circuit with a resistor and an on/off switch. T o enhance
light sensitivity , a small opening is incorporated at the bot-
tom of each LDR cube, allowing the sensors to be exposed
just enough to effectively capture incoming light signals.
Each cube is design to offer flexibility in configuration, and
can be programmed to achieve one of the following behav-
iors: 1) acting as a trigger, thus incorporating a threshold
over the amount of light being exposed, or 2) acting as a
continuous controller, thus constantly send normalized light
intensity values at configurable sample rate (Fig. 3).
4. CO-COMPOSING ACTIVITIES
After the overall design of the interface was defined, we
composed two pieces using O ၂, in parallel with author 2 -
an European composer - and author 3 - a Chinese composer
- closely collaborating with the main designer. The purpose
of such activity were twofold: on the one hand, to gather
concrete insights for refining the instrument ns design and
features; on the other, to practically explore how O ၂ could
support diverse cultural perspectives and creative processes
with respect to the boards’ inscribed time conceptions. The
processes were documented with diaries containing logs of
all the conversations and ideas emerged, with three diaries
being produced. This material has been used during a self
reflecting process using Reflection-on-Action [ 3] - an ap-
proach derived by social science that allows practitioners
to derive insights by self reflecting on their own practice,
widely applied in recent NIME research (e.g. [ 8, 36, 10]).
The reflections was carried out collectively , and we pro-
pose here a summary of the key insights that emerged, along
with a brief description of technical and choices and broader
musical conceptions. W e acknowledge that our sample is
limited, and we do not claim this work to be representative
of all perspectives; however, we still believe the reflections
that emerged may provide valuable insights for researchers
and practitioners working at the intersection of interface
design and cross-cultural composition. Indeed, during the
post-hoc discussions, we realized a significant divergence in
the composer’s approaches due to their different cultural
backgrounds. T o better illustrate these differences, the fol-
lowing subsections present each perspective individually .
A detailed analysis of the composition is beyond the scope
of the paper; as such, we simply provide a general overview
of the composer’s background and main musical ideas to
help contextualize the subsequent paragraphs. F or those
interested in the actual musical outcome, we refer to the ac-
companying demo recording 3 . After each overview, we use
the first-person voice to emphasize individual viewpoints.
4.1 Western Composer Approach
The first composer is European and has a strong back-
ground in free improvisation, electroacoustic composition,
and W estern music theory . He is a proficent SuperCollider
user and has 10 years of experience in the contemporary
music field.
4.1.1 Musical Conception and Interaction Design
I conceived the piece around three elements: a looping audio
track of a found (field-recorded) urban environment, a coun-
terpoint of synthesized high-pitched bells and low-pitched
drones, and a digital degradation process that gradually
acts on the loop, inspired by William Basinski’s The Disin-
tegration Loops. Musically speaking, such loop serves as a
structural foundation, as its repetitions are very recogniz-
able, while the other sounds acts as disruptive intervention.
There is no pre-defined score to follow, just a system to
explore trough interaction. Indeed, the performer may use
up to four cubes: two triggers the individual sounds, and
two modulates their parameters - e.g. pitch or timbre. Mu-
sical articulations is created trough the choice of actions
with the cubes on O ၂. However, every trigger linearly
increases the amount of degradation, making each action
consequential and leading the loop toward complete disso-
lution. The modes of interaction have been deliberately
kept fairly simple: it was my intention to explore the con-
ception of time rather than to design a complex musical
system.
Theoretically , the loop could play indefinitely; never-
theless, any musical gesture - metaphorically , action - in-
evitably introduces change, whose effects clearly manifest
in the present but also have subtle future repercussions,
that accumulate and cannot be undone. This reveals the
metaphor at the core of my musical idea: even if loops may
represent a continuous, repetitive temporal imaginary , ev-
ery action irreversibly alters the perception of repetition
and establishes a obefore-and-after”, returning a sense of
linear development.

4.1.2 Personal Reﬂections
Ontologically , in my perspective, I realized that therens no
such thing as ocircular time”, as I conceive any musical
act - as linear in its development over time. I nm used to
performing with loops which constantly repeat themselves
indefinitely , however, their displacements eventually unfold
in a linear conception. This is influenced by the minimal-
ist idea of musical development. While this perspective is
grounded in W estern musical studies, where structure and
forms are foundational of composition, I was not actively
aware of this perspective. W orking with O ၂ forced me
into an extremely constrained condition that allowed me to
actively engage with such idea - for instance, realizing the
linear nature that loops have in my musical conception.
F rom an interaction design perspective, in the presence
of an actual artifact involved in the composition process I
cannot disentangle the musical idea from the instrument it-
self. Therefore, for me it was very important to understand
exactly the details of the interface, as to work with it in a
performative fashion. F or instance, since the performer has
to put or move blocks to interact with the system, I have
to take this into account, as the number of actions that
the performer can actively apply are physically limited. On
the other hand, if too many automations are used in the
synthesizers, then the original metaphor may gets lost in
the complexities. This is why I bent the original interac-
tion and had both boards controlling sounds linearly , while
leaving the loop to be played independently by the machine
(that was in any case conceived in a linear form as discussed
above).
4.2 Chinese Composer Approach
The second composer is Chinese and has a strong back-
ground in Chinese traditional music performance and com-
position. T rained at W estern conservatories, the composer
is a proficient pianist, as well as pipa and erhu player. The
composer has 16 years of experience blending traditional
Chinese timbres with contemporary orchestral and cham-
ber compositions.
4.2.1 Musical Conception and Interaction Design
The technical setup is built around Pure Data as the pri-
mary audio platform. The sound architecture is built
around three main thematic elements, through five curated
sound excerpts. These are drawn from Chinese operatic,
folk, and percussive traditions, namely: Huangmei (઼
༤) - first excerpt includes pipa melodies mixed with oper-
atic singing and humming; W oven Imprints (ࣜܝtwo
rhythmic sections from a Chinese Luogu concerto, with b1
focusing on gong and drum patterns, and b2 using oboe reed
extended techniques to alter the listener’s sense of rhythm;
Gan Sheng Ling (വਲ) - based on a Shanbei folk theme,
with c1 highlighting Erhu, Sheng, and T anggu, and c2 em-
ploying the Suona for a strong, impactful sound.
Conceptually , the piece explores the multiplicity of tem-
poralities within Chinese musical traditions. Each theme
enacts a distinct temporal logic: Huangmei embodies the
psychological elasticity of operatic time, W oven Imprints
conveys cyclical and ritualistic pulse, and Gan Sheng Ling
evokes immediacy and embodied presence. Their juxtapo-
sition foregrounds how musical vocabularies carry different
philosophies of time, memory , and identity .
These five excerpts are mapped to triggers within a net-
worked OSC environment, controlled by LDR cubes modu-
lating parameters like amplitude, delay , and spectral filter-
ing. The cube ns proximity to LEDs influences the modula-
tion icloser gestures produce sharp articulations; distant
ones, softer transitions - inviting subtle bodily expression.
With no fixed score, the performance ns logic embodies a
time concept where music is not linear but cyclical and ever-
evolving, where the performer guides the system echoing the
unhurried temporal flow of Chinese culture.
Interaction design combines structured initiation with im-
provisational freedom. The first cube placed on the board
(O) sets the sonic foundation, with subsequent triggers
added sequentially . A real-time feedback system constantly
analyzes audio and loops back the data, shaping perfor-
mance dynamics. This self-regulating setup mirrors a har-
monious, cyclical relationship between performer and ma-
chine, emphasizing interconnectedness between humans and
nature, and a responsive - rather than controlling - interac-
tion with the environment.
4.2.2 Personal Reﬂections
I reflected on the challenges faced by many Chinese com-
posers when confronted with the cultural dilemmas of our
time. There is a pervasive sense of lagging behind - a sen-
timent that is well encapsulated in the works and writings
by figures such as Chou W en-Chung[ 41], who framed mu-
sical aesthetics through the lens of Chinese philosophical
concepts of time and space. The approach of combining
ethnic elements with W estern musical techniques - some-
times referred to as olocal specialty p(tǔ tè chǎn) - has
been a longstanding method, used by successive genera-
tions of composers. Y et, despite its historical significance,
this approach hindering my composing activities is I am
afraid of the approach often seems superficial, as it tends to
simply juxtapose traditional melodies with W estern frame-
works without fully reconciling their inherent differences.
After actively engaging with this system, I have come to
view the instrument not only as a tool for musical creation
but also as a means of alleviating creative anxiety . While
the traditional method of transplanting ethnic elements di-
rectly into W estern musical forms remains influential, I be-
lieve that the new technologies at this disposal offer fresh
perspectives. These boards along with my composed trig-
ger, allow for a more nuanced exploration of cultural time:
၂ could serve as an existing rule or framework which I can
continue to study and refer to, while O would be the free-
ing and seeing how Chinese musical time stands out. The
process of separating time in two conceptions with phys-
ical interaction to trigger musical ideas has provided me
with insights into how modern technology can enhance our
understanding of musical time and my own compositional
narrative continuity .
5. DISCUSSION
The core difference between the Chinese and W estern time
logic lies primarily in the understanding of change and
continuity in time, as well as the role of action within
the temporal framework.
The W estern composer is rooted in a progressive under-
standing of time. The loop serves as a foundation, but it
is fundamentally subject to a process of degradation driven
by deliberate, irreversible actions. Despite the repetitive
nature of such loop, this degradation introduces a linear
narrative, where each action builds upon the last, lead-
ing toward an endpoint. The metaphor lies in the idea of
before-and-after, where time is not a continuous, undulating
flow, but a series of discrete actions that lead to a tangible
result - a change that cannot be undone.
On the contrary , in the Chinese logic, time is cyclical and
fluid, without a definitive beginning or end. The loops do
not simply repeat: rather, they reflect an ongoing cycle.
Here, the passage of time is not something that is actively
shaped, rather something that is experienced through subtle
shifts reflecting a sense of unity and continuity . Within this
framework, actions might slightly alter the cycle, but do not
break it - there is no irreversible progression; instead, time
continues to move, evolving yet remaining grounded in its
circular nature.
This divergence highlights how designing the same inter-
face can lead to different cultural-depending forms of mu-
sical engagement, pointing to what Hayes and Marquez-
Borbon identify as sociotechnical entanglements in NIME:
the cultural, historical, and political layers shaping interac-
tion design [14]. Thus, this work exemplifies a fundamental
contrast in how time and change are treated:
1. Chinese Circular Time emphasizes continuity and
subtle change, where the past and future remain in-
terconnected within a non-linear flow.
2. W estern Linear Time focuses on progressive, irre-
versible change, with a sense of beginning, middle, and
end.
5.1 Time, Culture and Music in our practice
The main focus of this project was to explore in a practical
way a reflection on different conceptions of time which we
metaphorically inscribed in our instrument. Indeed, dur-
ing the co-composition activities and reflections, a strong
difference emerged in terms of time conception and its im-
plication. The W estern composer delved into his linear con-
ception of time. Accustomed to musical structures where
sounds and gestures unfold directionally over time (simi-
lar to what outlined in [ 38]), he found it diﬀicult to em-
brace a form that prioritized recurrence, fluidity , and non-
hierarchical development, even in presence of repetitive pat-
terns or loops. This aligns with the dialectic and structural
approaches that have long characterized W estern thought
[12, 1]. Conversely , the Chinese composer has been strongly
influenced by Eastern philosophies, and often highlighted
his roots in Chinese culture. While composing with O ၂,
he could experience the tension between Chinese music con-
ception and W estern terminology as exemplified in the use
ofࣜܝLuogu Jing) that is grounded on Beijing operans
rhythmic structure that cannot be explained using W estern
concepts of musical meter.
Such discrepancies resonates with the works by F eng [43]
and Cheng [ 4], both highlight the contrast between the lin-
ear, measurable time of W estern thought and the cyclical,
process-oriented time of Chinese philosophy . Also, we can
speculate on the cultural influence on time perception espe-
cially in the Eastern culture. F or instance, modern Chinese
scholars provide valuable insights into how time is under-
stood and represented in Chinese philosophy and cultural
manifestations , revealing a rich, dynamic tradition that
challenges W estern temporal frameworks. The temporal
culture of China was compelled to adapt to the establish-
ment of modern timekeeping systems under during the late
Qing Dynasty , as traditional chronological frameworks un-
derwent significant transformation in response to globaliza-
tion and technological modernity[ 42, 17, 16, 13]. In the
book The Global T ransformation of Time: 1870-1950, Ogle
[34] pointed out:
oThe nineteenth-century preoccupation with
progress and modernity was built on similar no-
tions of linear historical and naturalized, evolu-
tionary time. [...] In the non-W estern world,
mechanical clocks thus became status symbols,
displaying the owner’s keeping up with modern
timesp
Such an idiosyncratic relationship has been indeed
pointed out by Author 3, who reflected on compositional
methods which intertwine W estern and Eastern approaches,
perceiving such processes as a ocultural dilemma” .
5.2 Time Perspectives and new DMIs
Both composers overall highlighted the role of the hardware
interface in fostering such process, albeit differently . Over-
all we conclude by highlighting three main aspects of time-
instrument relationship: cultural inscriptions, personal me-
diation, and form-related affordances.
1. As Magnusson widely discussed, instruments has the-
ories inscribed in their design [ 26]. W e expand on this
by suggesting that these inscriptions are also cultur-
ally informed, and instruments may carry with them
peculiar conceptions of time and value outside domi-
nant W estern academic paradigms. As such, they can
serve as bridges between diverse epistemologies, en-
abling new forms of musical knowledge and practice
to emerge.
2. The time inscribed in the instrument is mediated
through the lens of musicians’ own cultural and per-
sonal background. While the time conceptions in-
scribed in the instruments determined specific musik-
ing strategies, composers’ individualities played a piv-
otal role in the final pieces. This is in line with [ 27],
where the authors observed that the background of
musicians can at times overcome the specificity of a
system. Indeed, the mapping flexibility of DMIs al-
lows and promotes nuanced negotiation between pre-
configured structures and embodied musical perspec-
tives.
3. While the idea that the instruments embed a certain
music theory is overall well established [ 26], studies
on the relationship between instruments and broader
musical forms are relatively recent (e.g. [ 9, 28]). By
examining how different temporal concepts are em-
bedded in and activated by instruments, we gain in-
sights into how musical form itself can be shaped by
the temporal affordances and constraints of the inter-
face.
These three dimensions reinforce the fact that DMIs are
not merely tools for realizing temporal structures, rather
active participants in shaping them. In this sense, thinking
through time in relation to design choices opens possibili-
ties for more inclusive, reflexive, and contextually grounded
musical practices.
6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present a practice-based exploration of
the relationship between time, musical instruments, and
cultural background. The work consists in a collabora-
tion of three practitioners, designing and composing O ၂,
a custom-made DMI. Building the different cultural back-
ground of the authors (Chinese and W estern), a number
of different reflection have emerged; in the discussion, we
outlined a few points that connect such reflection to recent
literature in the hope it can support NIME practitioners to
incorporate reflection on time and its cultural implication
in their design.
