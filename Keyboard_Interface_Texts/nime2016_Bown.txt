ABSTRACT
We describe a project in which a game of lawn bowls was recreated
using Distributed Interactive Audio Devices (DIADs), to create an
interactive musical experience in the form of a game. This paper
details the design of the underlying digital music system, some
of the compositional and design considerations, and the technical
challenges involved. We discuss future directions for our system
and compositional method.

1. INTRODUCTION
Bowls was presented at Musify+Gamify, an inter-disciplinary per-
formance and installation event held at the Seymour Centre, Sydney,
Australia, as part of the Vivid festival held in 2015. Bowls was a
new musical interface and installation that explored novel methods
of interaction with musical interfaces, and created a social non-
competitive musical game, which was an adaptation of the game of
lawn bowls. The game was based around rolling, holding, placing
and throwing 6 DIADs [1] (battery powered wirelessly networked
single board systems with attached loudspeakers) which were con-
tained within bowl-shaped 3D-printed enclosures. As each group
member rolled a bowl the devices responded, with the game object
being to interact with the devices in a collaborative manner. In
this paper we examine previous work in this research area, and we
discuss the design of the installation, in terms of both technical
lessons learnt, and design processes and techniques that proved
important. We also reﬂect on the software and hardware used, and
its effect on the design of the system.
2. RELATED WORK
Games have had a long history in music, digital art and interaction
design, as a method by which groups of people can be encouraged
to collaborate within a social artwork. Musical games were created
by composers such as John Zorn and Iannis Xenakis [4]. Even
further back, dice music was a form of composition found in the

18th century, with K.516 being attributed to Mozart (but without
conﬁrmation) and other composers such as Kirnberger or C.P.E
Bach composing in the style. A classic example of a digital game
system is the work by Loren and Rachel Carpenter, whereby a
video game of Pong was projected in front of a large audience, who
received physical paddles with 2 coloured panels. The game system
responded to the number of panels showing a particular colour on
each side of the room, and each side of the audience needed to show
the right number of paddles to move the in game paddle [3].
Camera and display based interaction systems such as the above
have steadily been joined by physical or tangible systems using
accelerometers, gyroscopes and wireless technology. For instance,
in 2007 Jon Rose created ‘Spheres of Inﬂuence’, a 2.4 m beach ball
that was instrumented with an accelerometer which was wirelessly
used to drive audio synthesis algorithms 1. Similarly, in Urban
Musical Game [5], Rasamimanana et al. instrumented a set of
foam balls and used accelerometer data to drive Max/MSP based
soniﬁcation.
Much work recently has looked at the casual involvement of
music into physical interaction scenarios, providing auditory feed-
back to game users. This involves ﬁnding a suitable meeting point
between the requirements of an interactive user experience and the
compositional constraints and needs of a musical work. Increas-
ingly, musical composition methods and tools are being developed
with this in mind. The work described in this paper draws on these
diverse precursors in various ways, but it is also one of the ﬁrst
audio games we know of that not only instruments the interface,
but also embeds the audio processing, synthesis capability, commu-
nication and the computational logic within the device, rather than
requiring a central computer to control the process.
3. DESIGN
Following previous DIADs projects, and in keeping with the theme
of Musify+Gamify, we set out to adapt an existing game by ‘musi-
fying’ it, combining playful physical interaction with a musical
experience. Lawn bowls was the ideal candidate for several reasons.
Lawn balls are similar in size to our previous DIAD prototypes, and
big enough to house the required electronic equipment. The game
involves tactile interaction, but is gentle in nature and therefore not
likely to damage or wear out equipment. It is a quiet, collective
experience. It has a simple order and logic which adapts itself
nicely to a musical structure. Lastly, it is hugely popular in our
home country of Australia. This is the ﬁrst instance we know of
of a ball game being adapted for a musical purpose with the entire
interaction and sounding technology incorporated inside the ball
itself.
Like most games, Bowls has a clear progression of states. We can
detect whether balls are rolling (strong oscillatory patterns in the
accelerometer data), resting (minimal variation in the accelerometer
data), being held in the hand (light variation in accelerometer data),
in mid-air/freefall (near zero accelerometer values), and being im-

pacted (sudden variation in accelerometer data). This makes it easy
to chart the progress of the game. As successive balls are rolled and
come to rest, we can make reasonable estimates about which balls
have been played, and therefore how many are in play. Once all of
the balls have come to rest we can tell that the round is over, soon
after which we can expect all of the balls to be picked up.
The musical elements consisted of a series of harmonised sounds
for each state, which were modulated by the accelerometer data.
Simple mid-range undulating drones were used in the hand-held
state. A higher pitched bell tinkle was used for the freefall state.
Mid-range shimmering piano drones were used for the rolling sound,
giving a sense of build-up. Electronic drones were used for the
resting state. Heavy acoustic guitar plucks were used for impact
events. Climactic harmonious drone were used when the end of
the game was detected, ending when the balls were picked up.
The overall effect was therefore one in which the game structure
dictated a clear sonic progression, which would then repeat, creating
an immersive soundtrack to the game.
This installation context prompted a re-think of the DIAD’s phys-
ical enclosure design. We noticed that the previous physical design
(an egg shape) had made some interactions difﬁcult to perform –
rolling or bouncing the device was unpredictable and difﬁcult. The
enclosure was also quite difﬁcult to open and close, as it required
the precise placement of 4 grub screws per device, but this was
necessary to switch the electronic device on and off, meaning that
beginning a performance was a tense process. The lawn bowls
game we were imitating uses balls of a certain shape and size, and
so we imitated this physical form for this installation, permitting
rolling and (to some extent) bouncing of the devices. We found
that the shape of the devices was very successful – the interaction
possibilities were signiﬁcantly extended and the device was capable
of many new behaviours.
4. IMPLEMENTATION
The initial design of the DIADs system was described in [2]. At its
core is a Java program that runs on the Pi, using theBeads library for
computer music. The Java program is set to autorun upon startup,
and begin listening on a local wi-ﬁ network. Once Pis are online
the central computer can send any Pis packets of Java bytecode,
corresponding to speciﬁc Java classes that implement the PIPO (PI
Playback Object) interface. Thus from the central controller one
can easily experiment with code in real time. For the piece itself,
a PIPO can be speciﬁed to run on autostart, and the Pis can run
on their own as a network without the central computer being in
use. For Bowls, each Pi was coded with a state machine tracking
the state of the Pi according to the sensor data. State changes were
broadcast to all other Pis, so that each Pi could keep track of the
state of the entire system. A series of audio graphs were set up,
corresponding to different sound scenes, with audio objects that
were then inﬂuenced by these network messages. Elements were
faded in and out during state changes, and the sensor data was
continually used to modulate many of the sounds.
5. REFLECTIONS ON PICODE
The Bowls work is a continuation of a series of compositional and
installation-based experiments for the DIADs. Our focus is on the
ease and ﬂexibility of development of the work, using code as the
main tool for the creation of the musical content, integrated with
the interactive behaviour. The approach of running device-side
server software and being able to send compiled bytecode is, we
have found, extremely productive. From a rapid development and
deployment point of view, it is robust, indeed quicker than running
and re-running software on a computer, because a large amount of
the code has already been compiled and is already running on the
device. This is an effective approach to working with embedded
systems because compilation can be quite slow, and feedback can be
difﬁcult as these systems do not have good user interfaces. Likewise
the simple suite of network communication tools we have made
forms a solid basis for working creatively with multi-device music
performance. Sending and receiving network messages can be done
ﬂuidly, as can programming behaviours for collections of devices.
In terms of the installation design, incorporating the logic into
the physical design reorientates the game participant. With many
display-based systems, there is a tendency for participant to hold the
interface, and then turn to the screen for instruction, subordinating
the participant to the display system, and requiring attention to
the usually large display. With the integrated physical system the
integrity of the social relationships of the group of participants
may be more easily maintained, with the computational element
being overlaid directly onto the physical devices (rather than being
projected separately). This is predicated on the use of the auditory
modality – participants cannot concentrate easily on the physical
shape and social context while ﬁxated on a visual display, but the
auditory modality frees their eyes from this necessity.
6. CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE RESEARCH
This paper has detailed an implementation of a new musical inter-
face that allows the development of a interactive musical game. This
research has also explored the capabilities of the DIADs system
- speciﬁcally its ability to run as a self-contained musical inter-
face and reproduction system. In general, the system shows many
strengths within the context of a ‘musifyed’ physical game system.
It has highlighted the importance of a ﬂexible software develop-
ment and deployment system. In future work with the system, we
plan to improve the audio reproduction capabilities of the system,
by employing higher power ampliﬁcation systems, and building
enclosures that incorporate loudspeakers. We also plan to extend
the systems for synchronising the playback of musical events, both
in terms of representing the patterns and also in terms of smart time
synchronisation of the group of devices. Nevertheless, the system
has shown its potential for the development of complex audio in-
stallations based around group interaction and the augmentation of
physical gaming through the auditory modality.
