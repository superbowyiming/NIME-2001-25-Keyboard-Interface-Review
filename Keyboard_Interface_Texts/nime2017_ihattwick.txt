ABSTRACT
In this paper we present a discussion of the development of
hardware systems in collaboration with professional artists,
a context which presents both challenges and opportuni-
ties for researchers interested in the uses of technology in
artistic practice. The establishment of design speciﬁcations
within these contexts can be challenging, especially as they
are likely to change during the development process. In
order to assist in the consideration of the complete set of
design speciﬁcations, we identify seven aspects of hardware
design relevant to our applications: function, aesthetics,
support for artistic creation, system architecture, manufac-
turing, robustness, and reusability. Examples drawn from
our previous work are used to illustrate the characteristics
of interdependency and temporality, and form the basis of
case studies investigating support for artistic creation and
reusability. We argue that the consideration of these de-
sign aspects at appropriate times within the development
process may facilitate the ability of hardware systems to
support continued use in professional applications.

1. INTRODUCTION
Many research questions which involve the eﬀects and im-
plications of the use of new technologies in artistic perfor-
mance require the use of novel hardware interfaces in real-
world performance contexts. As creators of such interfaces,
we are often asked to collaborate in research projects with
artists who are actively engaged with precisely such ques-
tions. Frequently, these artists bring with them years of
professional artistic experience, strong opinions on the use
of technology in performance, and commitments to public
presentations. As designers, collaboration in this context
can be extremely gratifying as our collaborators are heavily

invested in the success of the project and will invest the time
to gain a deep familiarity with our designs. However, bring-
ing such a collaboration to a successful conclusion brings
many challenges.
This paper presents some conclusions drawn from an on-
going research project aimed at discovering practices to fa-
cilitate the creation of new hardware performance systems
for professional artistic productions, typically within col-
laborative projects. As such, our discussion will assume
a distinction between the technology developers and the
artists/researchers involved in these projects, and will fo-
cus on the point of view of the developers. In practice, this
distinction is highly blurred as the research goals of the de-
velopers generally will go beyond the development of new
technology and the artists/researchers may also have an ac-
tive hand in development, and in other situations the artist
and developer may be situated in the same person. By sep-
arating the two in our discussion we seek to focus on the
challenges of technology development within this context
rather than engaging with speciﬁc artistic practices.
Our discussion will centre on the consideration of seven
aspects of the design of a hardware/software system, each
providing a diﬀerent perspective on the system, and we
will illustrate characteristics of these aspects with example
drawn from our experience in three major research projects.
The ﬁrst was the creation of the Prosthetic Instruments, a
family of interfaces designed to be worn by dancers in an
interactive dance performance [12]. The second was the cre-
ation of the Ilinx garment, a vibrotactile-enhanced garment
worn in an immersive multisensory art installation [13]. The
most recent is the ongoing development of the Vibropixels,
a reconﬁgurable and scalable tactile display for use in artis-
tic applications[11]. All of these projects have involved close
collaboration with a variety of artists and researchers from
diﬀerent disciplines, and have collectively been used in pro-
fessional public performances in the EU, North America,
and Asia.
Reﬂecting on our experiences in these projects has led us
to the conceptions of the design process we present here.
Given the knowledge and interests of researchers in the
NIME community, collaborations within contexts like those
we discuss in this paper may be increasingly desirable. Our
hope is that our articulation of the various design aspects
will provide a resource for other researchers in the NIME
community who are interested in taking on the challenge of
developing hardware systems for professional artistic appli-
cations.
1.1 Deﬁnitions
Throughout this paper we will continually refer to our ‘artis-
tic collaborators’ and the artistic creation process. We do
436
this as we collaborate with a wide range of artistic prac-
titioners, including music performers, composers, dancers,
choreographers, clothing designers, visual artists, and cre-
ators of interactive artworks. While the speciﬁc needs of
our collaborators vary widely, we ﬁnd that the development
process we describe here is generally applicable to all of the
collaborations we have undertaken.
We also refer to the hardware components of the sys-
tem as ‘devices’ rather than interfaces or instruments as the
hardware’s function within the artwork may not be primar-
ily as an input device. In addition, while many hardware
systems in fact comprise a combination of hardware, device
ﬁrmware, and software, we will attempt to consistently re-
fer to the combination of all of the aspects as a ‘hardware
system’.
2. PREVIOUS WORK
To establish the background for the research described in
this paper this section presents a brief overview of method-
ologies and principles for music interface design, as well as
an exploration of two design approaches from other ﬁelds.
2.1 Music Interface Design
While many publications have addressed the design of mu-
sical interfaces, these have largely focused on what we de-
scribe below as being functional design. Overholt, for exam-
ple, proposes a Musical Interface Technology Design Space
which focuses on gesture, mapping, and expressiveness [16].
Marshall et. al discuss a diﬀerent approach to design which
focuses on the evaluation of transducer technologies for spe-
ciﬁc musical tasks [15]. As functional design remains the
primary focus of research on new musical interface design,
publications such as these do not spend much time dis-
cussing the challenges of bringing such interfaces out of the
lab and into real-world performance contexts.
2.1.1 Perry Cook’s Principles
One set of publications which does provide such advice are
Perry Cook’s Principles for Computer Music Controllers
[6, 5]. In 2001, Cook proposed 13 principles sorted into
three groupings, “Human/Artistic Principles”, “Technologi-
cal Principles”, and “Other Principles”. In 2009, Cook ex-
panded these principles to expand upon the previous group-
ings as well as proposing a new grouping covering “Con-
troller (Re)Design”.
Cook bases his principles on his own extensive experience
as an interface designer and researcher, and describes them
as being opinions more than universal recommendations.
Coming from this perspective, his principles engage easily
with such diverse issues as artistic motivation, technologi-
cal implementation, and research methodology. As impor-
tantly, however, it reﬂects a longitudinal view of interface
design in the context of research, especially the 2009 pa-
per. Including observations from both his experience with
PLOrk as well as with the redesign of an accordion-inspired
controller, Cook discusses issues which are not often seen at
NIME, including the maintenance, redesign, and evolution
of an interface.
2.2 Approaches From Other Disciplines
Many research disciplines focus explicitly and implicitly on
design processes. While a full review of these various ap-
proaches are outside the scope of this paper, we want to
mention a few speciﬁc examples which have been inﬂuential
in our work.
2.2.1 Total Design
Stuart Pugh’s Total Designdescribes the overall process of
product design from market analysis to sales [17]. This ap-
proach to design as a holistic process matches with much of
our experience in creating technological systems in that the
design process incorporates more than just the conceptual
and functional design stages.
The main structure of the Total Design process is a six-
stage Design Core consisting of three primary sections – the
identiﬁcation of the market & of user need; four iterative
stages consisting of deﬁning the product design speciﬁca-
tion, creating conceptual designs, creating detailed designs,
and manufacturing; and a ﬁnal stage consisting of consid-
erations in the sales and marketing of the product.
The deﬁnition of a Product Design Speciﬁcation (PDS) is
perhaps the most important part of the Total Design pro-
cess. Comprised of a comprehensive set of design require-
ments, the PDS should be comprehensive, detailed, and un-
ambiguous. Importantly, Pugh describes the PDS as being
a living document, one which will evolve over the course of
the design process. This is especially true during the central
stages of the design core, which consist of iterating through
the four central stages until all of the PDS is fully-deﬁned
and met by the technical and detailed design. However,
Pugh argues that an insuﬃcient consideration of the ﬁrst
and last stages of the design core can cause a product to
fail as readily as any other stage.
2.2.2 Software Design and Interactive Digital Art
Many interactive digital artworks have been created through
collaborations between artists and technology developers,
frequently supported by academic and artistic institutions
[3]. There have been several researchers who have writ-
ten about design issues within this context, largely focus-
ing on software design, in ways which have inﬂuenced our
own conception of the design process. Machin presents an
overview of the role of the software engineer within a collab-
orative artistic context, including a discussion of diﬀerent
models of collaboration and the diﬃculty of deﬁning accu-
rate speciﬁcations [14]. One key argument Machin makes
is that the successful use of a new technological system in
an artistic work will often depend upon the creation of an
interface which allows the artist to program the system. As
the material manifestation of a technological system can be
diﬃcult to specify and visualize, artists will often need to
go beyond specifying the sequencing of the system’s states
based on their initial conceptions. Instead, the creation of a
programming interface which is accessible to the artist can
allow them to freely explore the behaviours and capabilities
of the system in order to generate artistic materials.
Trifonova et. al provide another perspective through a
literature review of papers describing the creation of inter-
active artworks as well as papers describing software engi-
neering practices [18]. Focusing more explicitly on exist-
ing concepts drawn from software engineering, the paper
remarks again on the diﬃculty of establishing design re-
quirements, as well discussing system architecture, process
management, and testing, validation, and evaluation. One
observation they make is that maintenance and open source
software is not mentioned in any of their reviewed papers,
a lack of concern for the robustness and re-use of the sys-
tem that we are also concerned with, and which drive those
designs aspects we describe below.
3. DESIGN ASPECTS & SPECIFICATIONS
The deﬁnition of design speciﬁcations is a central part of
most design processes, and may also be referred to as iden-
tifying design requirements or creating a design brief. This
activity is so important that Cather et al. state “[t]he lack
437
of a complete and thorough written speciﬁcation is now gen-
erally accepted as being one of the main reasons for design
failure” [4, p. 36]. In his description of Product Design
Speciﬁcations, Pugh speciﬁes 32 elements which he argues
are necessary in a complete PDS [17, pp. 44-66]. While
some of these, such as shelf-life storage, competition, and
market constraint, may have little impact on applications in
our contexts, many of them are surprisingly pertinent, in-
cluding aesthetics, performance, shipping, installation, and
maintenance.
However they are conceptualized, design speciﬁcations
represent speciﬁc characteristics a device must possess in
order to successfully meet the device’s objectives. One of
the challenges in articulating speciﬁcations is their interde-
pendent nature, in that they often impact many diﬀerent
aspects of the device’s design. This is especially confound-
ing as device speciﬁcations change frequently over the course
of development, necessitating a continuous re-evaluation of
the overall design. Working in collaboration with artists
poses a special challenge in this respect, as design speciﬁca-
tions will often be vague in the beginning of the project, and
will often need to accommodate changes due to experience
gained during the artistic creation process.
Within the context of our own work we ﬁnd it useful to
consider a simpliﬁed grouping of speciﬁcations, which we re-
fer to as design aspects. These aspects are related to Pugh’s
PDS, but speak directly to our applications of developing
hardware systems for professional artistic productions, and
each oﬀers a diﬀerent perspective on the development and
performance of a system.
3.1 Design Aspects
In this section we will present an overview of seven design
aspects we have found to be relevant for our applications.
We stress here that these design aspects are not necessarily
mutually exclusive, and the diﬀerentiations described here
are more to provide a way for designers to gain an overview
of the system rather than creating a complete technical de-
scription of a system.
3.1.1 Functional
Generally speaking, any new hardware device will be cre-
ated in order to provide some mechanical or electronic func-
tionality. As discussed above in section 2.1, this aspect is
the primary focus of most research in DMI design. While
this preeminence will be manifest throughout the design
process, focusing on functional design alone will not ensure
the success of the device in context.
3.1.2 Aesthetic
Aspects of the design that qualitatively aﬀect the experi-
ence of the user or audience. For a digital music interface
this might include its visual appearance, forms of gestural
interaction, and ergonomics. For a wearable device this will
include the ﬁt and feel of the device.
3.1.3 System Architecture
The ways in which the system supports its functionality in
context. This includes both technical functionality, such as
communication protocols and power management, as well
as the system’s integration into the actual performance con-
text, which involves interaction with other systems used in
the production as well as the production staﬀ.
3.1.4 Artistic Creation
The ability of the hardware system to support the artistic
creation process, both during the development process and
in the ﬁnal design, discussed further in section 4.3.
3.1.5 Manufacturing
Many of the projects we are involved with require the cre-
ation of multiple copies of our devices, and therefore man-
ufacturing considerations play a key role in our design pro-
cess. However, no matter the scale of the project, the choice
of manufacturing techniques will impact many aspects of a
device’s ﬁnal design, including the choice of materials, the
ability to reproduce designs precisely, and the time and cost
required for manufacturing.1
3.1.6 Robustness
Any professional artistic production will require a system
that is reliable enough to withstand its use in context, in-
cluding mechanical, electronic, and digital elements. Ro-
bustness in this context means: that the system is able to
function without failing; that it will continue to work with-
out failing over the course of its intended use; that mainte-
nance of the system is speciﬁed and within the capabilities
of the system’s users; and that provisions for accommodat-
ing potential failures have been made, typically through the
provision of backup devices.
3.1.7 Reusability
The use of the system in the initially proposed public pre-
sentations is of course a primary outcome, but considering
the eﬀort and expense which goes into developing systems
suitable for these applications it is also important to con-
sider how they can support other outcomes. We will discuss
this further in section 4.4.
4. DISCUSSION
In this section we will discuss case studies from our previous
work that illustrate characteristics of the design aspects.
4.1 Interdependencies
While the design aspects each have their own perspective, in
practice device speciﬁcations frequently interact with mul-
tiple aspects, and when considering changes in one speciﬁ-
cation it can be helpful to consider ways in which they will
aﬀect the speciﬁcations of other aspects.
4.1.1 The Evolution of the Ribs
An example of this occurred during the design of the Ribs,
which are one of the Prosthetic Instruments. In their ﬁ-
nal form, the Ribs consist of a set of three diﬀerently sized
controllers which are able to be inserted into mounts on
a corset. Sensing on the Ribs consists of eight capacitive
touchpads along their length and an embedded 3-axis ac-
celerometer, and sensor data is streamed to a central com-
puter. Figure 1 shows the ﬁnal design of the Ribs as worn
by a performer.
The basic sensing functionality of the Rib was deﬁned
and implemented in the ﬁrst functional prototype, which
consisted of a small acrylic form with copper tape serving
as touchpads. While these prototypes met the functional
speciﬁcations, for aesthetic reasons we moved to explor-
ing conductive plastic touchpads in order to allow for fully
translucent forms. Once the transparent Ribs were manu-
factured, though, we observed that the transparent forms
did not have as much of a visual impact as the copper-clad
Ribs had. Larger sizes of Ribs were constructed in order to
make them more visible from a distance.
The larger sizes, combined with the cantilevered design,
caused several mechanical issues. First, the longer a Rib
was the more it had a tendency to ﬂex along its length as
the dancers moved. In addition, the extra weight of the

jacent touchpads can be seen as vertical lines along
the Ribs’ length. Photo c⃝Michael Slobodian.
Rib, as well as pressure exerted when its tip would contact
the ﬂoor, caused the acrylic forms to crack at the base. In
order to solve these problems, a multilayer, laminated con-
struction was designed, shown in ﬁgure 2, in order to create
a stiﬀer, more robust form. Additionally, two of the layers
were constructed from polycarbonate plastic as a precau-
tion in case cracks occurred in the acrylic layers during a
performance.
This example shows how the speciﬁcations of the various
aspects interact: the functionality (capacitive sensing) sug-
gested appropriate materials (copper and conductive plas-
tic); changes in the aesthetic (larger transparent forms)
created issues with robustness and ﬂex (due to the ma-
terial properties of acrylic); changes in the form to meet
robustness and stiﬀness speciﬁcations led to the need for
new manufacturing techniques (laminated layers of acrylic
and polycarbonate). We note these interdependencies may
pose problems, but they also oﬀer opportunities for de-
sign improvements. In the case of the Ribs, we were quite
happy with the properties of the laminated construction
across many aspects, including functionality (mechanically
stiﬀ but light form), aesthetics, robustness, and manufac-
turability (it proved to be eﬃcient to manufacture).
4.2 Temporality
Given their diﬀerent perspectives, it is common for design
aspects to be highlighted at diﬀerent stages of the develop-
ment process. Again in the case of the Ribs, the functional
design and system architecture supporting the sensing was
determined quite early, followed by the mechanical function-
ality, aesthetics, and manufacturing. While this sequence is
fairly common the precise ordering is likely to change from
project to project.
Occasionally, changes to certain speciﬁcations which are
made out of step with the overall design process may cause
problems. The lighting in the Prosthetic Instruments, for
example, was developed more as an afterthought (a time-
line of the Ribs’ development which depicts this is shown
in ﬁgure 3), and it wasn’t until meeting with the produc-
tion’s lighting designer that we fully committed to lighting
all of the instruments. Leading up to the performances, our
eﬀorts were mostly directed towards manufacturing, and al-
though we worked on providing wireless control of the lights

nated construction of the Rib.
to the lighting designer we were not able to implement it to
our satisfaction before the ﬁnal rehearsals. In the end, we
set the lighting for the instruments to be permanently on
for the performances.
One of the goals of considering the design aspects is assist-
ing in consideration of all of the design aspects, even before
they become the primary focus of the design activity. Due
to the interdependent nature of the aspects, speciﬁcations
for manufacturing and reusability considerations may sug-
gest approaches to creating the functional design. Similarly,
considering the complete set of design aspects over the entire
development process may help to prevent the need for ex-
tensive redesigns, for example to modify the implementation
of functionality in order to satisfy robustness or reusability
speciﬁcations.
4.3 Support for the Artistic Creation Process
As the systems we create are typically developed in parallel
with the creation of artistic works by our collaborators, sup-
porting the artistic creation process goes beyond ensuring
that the ﬁnal design meets certain speciﬁcations. Instead,
during the development process it is typical for us to pro-
vide prototypes with limited functionality, as the artistic
creation process often relies upon an exploration of the ma-
terial properties of the system [14]. When creating these
prototypes, we aim to meet the minimum set of speciﬁca-
tions that will provide our collaborators with the materials
they need to complete their work. For example, in the cre-
ation of the Prosthetic Instruments, between workshops 2
& 3 we provided the choreographer and dancers with a full
set of instruments which were mechanically but not elec-
tronically functional, in order to allow them to work on
choreographic materials.
In addition, it is often necessary to provide software tools
to facilitate working with the system, which can range from
the creation of a user interface to the creation of an API,
depending on the knowledge and preferences of the artis-
tic collaborators. In our experience, the key considerations
in the creation of these tools are supporting our collabora-
tors’ preferred software environments, providing graphical
feedback regarding the eﬀect of parameter changes, and pro-
viding tools for working on the highest conceptual level of
the system while still enabling access to lower levels. 2

the development of the Vibropixels [11].

attempts to implement wireless control of the lighting. The diﬀerent activities are colour-coded according
to the design aspects they were most directly addressing.
4.4 Reusability
One of the goals of the design aspects is to help maintain
an awareness of all of the design goals, especially when the
diﬀerent temporalities cause us to focus on certain aspects
at diﬀerent stages. One aspect that we wish we had ad-
dressed more consistently is reusability. There are several
forms this can take – either reusing the system as is for
another project, modifying the system to be useable for
another project, developing a sub-system to be be useable
across diﬀerent projects, or using and disseminating knowl-
edge gained during the design process.
The development of the Ilinx garment ([13, 10]) and the
Vibropixels ([11]) provide examples of how reusability con-
siderations can lead to diﬀerent design outcomes. Both sys-
tems are wearable tactile displays intended to create full-
body tactile stimuli in immersive artistic installations; how-
ever, diﬀerences in their design speciﬁcations, and particu-
larly their reusability speciﬁcations, led to very diﬀerent
system architectures.
4.4.1 Reuse of the Ilinx garment
The Ilinx garment consists of a jacket and two leggings
which together are divided into ﬁve sections, one for each
limb and the torso, each with an actuator driver board and
six actuators sewn in a ﬁxed conﬁguration. The sections
communicate via Cat5 cables with a minicomputer, which
in turn communicates via WiFi with a central PC. Follow-
ing the initial public presentations using the garment, other
researchers in our lab have since used elements of the system
for other research projects, including a tactile metronome
system and the creation of tactile musical scores.
For the tactile metronome application, the system was
modiﬁed to distribute single-actuator signals to each of four
diﬀerent performers [9, pp. 142-143]. To accomplish this, a
single driver board (encased in a 3D printed housing able to
be clipped to a belt) and actuator (attached to a resizable
strap) were provided to each performer. The driver boards
were also connected to a minicomputer in the same fashion
as the regular Ilinx garment system, although the minicom-
puter and PC do not communicate via WiFi but through a
wired Ethernet connection.
The Ilinx electronics have also been used for prototyping
a system for the creation of tactile musical scores [2]. Sim-
ilar to the Ilinx garment, this system uses actuators sewn
in ﬁxed conﬁgurations – however, the ﬁnal application de-
mands a diﬀerent conﬁguration of actuators and therefore
necessitates the manufacturing of new garments. Currently
the prototypes use the Ilinx electronics system as-is; how-
ever, the use of the minicomputer to coordinate with the
computer (along with the use of a single large battery in
the same location) is seen as undesirable. Ultimately, the
project is planning a redesign of the electronics system to
allow each garment section to have its own wireless trans-
mitter and battery.
While these examples illustrate diﬀerent approaches to
successfully reusing the system, each required quite a bit
of customization, in particular due to the ﬁxed actuator lo-
cations. Nonetheless, certain aspects of the system have
proven useful, notably the driver boards. In addition, the
redesign of the system for the tactile score application uti-
lizes many processes and subsystems developed during the
design of the Ilinx garment.
4.4.2 The Vibropixels
Our experience with the Ilinx garment led us to consider
ways of creating a tactile display system which could be
more easily reused for a variety of applications without sig-
niﬁcant modiﬁcations. While also being a wearable tactile
display, the use of a diﬀerent system architecture in the Vi-
bropixels facilitates their reuse to a much greater degree,
which was one of the primary design goals for the project.
To accomplish this, the Vibropixels are a modular system in
which each actuator location has its own wireless transceiver
and battery, removing the need for any wired connections
between actuators. This allows for a very ﬂexible conﬁg-
uration, both in terms of location and number for a single
person, but also in terms of distribution of the system across
multiple people. The initial public presentation accommo-
dated 19 people wearing seven Vibropixels each. Other ap-
plications in development include an artwork accommodat-
ing 100 people wearing two Vibropixels each; a tactile game
consisting of 16 players; and a tactile metronome applica-
tion using a single Vibropixel. For each of these applications
no hardware modiﬁcations were necessary.
5. CONCLUSION
The design aspects discussed here were developed over the
course of research projects conducted in collaboration with
professional artists, and which were focused on creating sys-
tems suitable for professional artistic productions. As such,
they reﬂect our personal experience and conceptions of how
to structure our research and design activity. However, we
would argue that a consideration of these aspects can be
beneﬁcial for many diﬀerent research contexts within the
NIME community, and that interface designers who utilize
their interfaces in performance engage with these aspects at
some level, whether they consider them explicitly or not.
440
The degree to which design speciﬁcations need to be for-
malized may be disputed, and certainly the approach pre-
sented in this paper is coming from the perspective of the
technology developer. However, the simpliﬁed set of design
aspects (as opposed to Pugh’s 32 elements) is intended to
focus only on those perspectives that will contribute most
directly to the ability of new devices to meet the challenges
of artistic contexts. From a practical standpoint, failure of
any of the design aspects (barring, perhaps, reusability) 3
will make it much less likely for a new system to be used for
an extended period. This speaks directly to the frequently
made observation that new instruments and installations
frequently have a very short lifespan [7, 1, 8]. If contin-
ued use of a new interface has the potential to add to the
knowledge created by that interface’s construction (and we
would argue it does), then creating interfaces which support
continued use should be encouraged.
Finally, it is clear that the explicit consideration of the de-
sign aspects should be in proportion to the amount of time
invested in the design process. 4 For work which will only
be shown within conference settings, or will only be used in
its creator’s own artistic practice, the formalization of de-
sign aspects presented here may not be relevant. However,
we believe that the NIME community would beneﬁt from
the exploration of many interesting research questions (in-
cluding longitudinal use of new interfaces, creation of new
interfaces for professional artists, ensemble use of new in-
terfaces, etc.) which require the creation of systems which
do engage with the complete set of design aspects. It is our
hope that the discussion presented in this paper will encour-
age other researchers to take on the challenge of developing
such systems.

ability to facilitate design iterations, helping overcome the
challenge that, as Luke Dahl observes, “the ﬁdelity required
