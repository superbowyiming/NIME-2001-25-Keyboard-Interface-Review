ABSTRACT 
Recent years have witnessed the appearance of many new digital musical instruments 
(DMIs) and other interfaces for musical expression (NIME). This paper highlights a 
well-established music educational background theory that we believe may help DMI 
developers and users better understand DMIs in the context of music cognition and 
education.
From an epistemological perspective, we present the paradigm of enactive music 
cognition related to improvisation in the context of the skills and needs of 21st century 
music learners. 
We hope this can lead to a deeper insertion of DMIs into music education, as well as to 
new DMIs to be ideated, prototyped and developed within these concepts and theories 
in mind.  
We specifically address the theory generally known as the 4E`s model of cognition ( 
embodied, embedded, extended and enactive,) within DMIs. The concept of autopoiesis 
is also described. Finally, we present some concrete cases of DMIs and NIMEs, and we 
describe how the experience of musical improvisation with them may be seen through 
the prism of such theories.

1.  INTRODUCTION
Human culture traditionally interacts in activities recognized as musical vitalizing 
traditional practices keeping the music and culture alive [40]. Improvised sound-
making occurs within melodic, rhythmic,  sonic, harmonic, and social frameworks 
across many communities [40, 41] and can be situated as a core objective in music 
learning. Improvisation in music education challenges students through effective 
listening, develops a strong sense of creative potential, prepares them for complex 
decision making during performance [19], and impels the ability to  interact with other 
musical genres and cultures [7]. In an attempt to contribute to a better understanding 
of the meaning of improvisation for music education within Digital Musical 
Instruments (DMIs), this work considers possibilities of contemplative-enactive music 
cognition. We discuss the field of embodied cognition (Varela et al., 1993)  and the 
autopoiesis concept (Maturana & Varela, 1980) in its ability to express the relevance of 
participatory, relational, emergent, and embodied musical activities and developments, 
responding to a broader demand for the 21st-century musical apprenticeship [28, 42]. 
Through innovative learning technologies focusing on improvisation, music students 
may explore their embeddedness in a given milieu while simultaneously bringing 
contributions to the living enactment and transformation of the socio-cultural 
environment [14, 25, 40]. Although in recent decades there has been a growing 
recognition of the importance of improvisation in music education, the question of how 
it should be introduced and developed is still a challenge for music educators and DMI 
designers [19, 40]. In what follows, we consider how the recent “4E`s” model 
associated with cognition (which sees living cognition as essentially embodied, 
embedded, extended and enactive) [32] may offer a useful framework for the learning 
music process using  DMIs. The autopoiesis concept  which recognizes the adaptive 
capacity of living systems towards their environment as an intelligent cognitive 
process [26] is also described. 
It is important to note that this work is not evaluating DMIs, rather it presents 
observations and understandings concerning improvisation practice in the theory of

embodied music cognition considering enhancing music education.  
We conclude by presenting works related to the enactive approach for improvisational 
practice within DMIs.
2. IMPROVISATION IN MUSICAL APPRENTICESHIP
One of the three branches in Émile Jaques-Dalcroze`s pedagogy is improvisation 
(1865- 1950). Dalcroze was concerned with unifying the mind and body in musical 
feeling and physical sensation, to achieve musical fluency; flexibility; and, above all, a 
personal creative voice [17, 19, 43].
Although the pedagogical treatments of improvisation by Dalcroze have had a 
profound influence on modern music education, improvisation remains identified as a 
complex human activity [15, 19, 24]. The specific argument that improvisation is 
essential within music teaching and learning is held by a growing number of music 
pedagogues [7, 17, 18, 34, 36] and deeply integrates the fundamentals of music into a 
more comprehensive musicianship [13, 19]. Furthermore, due to the intrinsic nature of 
improvisation, it is considered as a highly inclusive, cross-cultural practice in which 
people participate in a more embodied form of music-making than that entailed in 
repertoire performance.
Recent years have seen the rise of the reintroduction of improvisation in music 
education [7, 41]; however, the question of just how it should be introduced and 
developed continues to be debated [40].
2.1 Improvisation within Enactivism
For Christopher Small (1998), listening is a seminal aspect of “musicking”, the term he 
uses to express the activity of music, where music is not primarily a thing or a 
collection of things, but an activity in which we engage [13, 34]. The association of the 
enactive approach and the term “musicking”  within improvisation, an activity that 
generally involves some kind of spontaneity for listening and acting, is addressed in 
this work from the perspective of pedagogy.  
As stated by Varela et al., (1993) “The term enactivism was chosen to emphasize that 
cognition is not the representation of a predetermined world by a predetermined mind, 
but rather the representation of a world and a mind based on a history of the variety of 
actions that being in the world performs”. Although the enactive approach does not 
offer a fixed method of assessment, it resonates with a rich set of ideas and research

Intersection between the 4E`s Model and DMIs

that informs the possibilities for integrating creative practice, reflection and self-
assessment. Under this light, the enactivist approach reveals living cognition as 
fundamentally improvised [21, 28, 40, 42].
2.2  4E`s of Cognition  & Music Pedagogy 
Van der Schyff states that enactivism can be defined, broadly speaking, in two ways. 
First it may be approached according to cognition. Recently, these have been referred 
to as the “4E`s,” which describe the mind as fundamentally: embodied, embedded,  
extended  and enactive, and have characteristics in common that led them to be 
grouped in this way. Secondly, the enactive perspective may also be distinguished by 
three overlapping principles that explain the 4E`s characteristics: autopoiesis, sense-
making and autonomy [41]. The autopoiesis concept is described in the next section. 
The 4E`s  model seek to open perspectives on the conception of the human mind by 
exploring elements other than the brain . The 4 E`s include the body, the environment 
and even technologies. According to this view, cognition depends on the body - in 
addition to the brain - to shape and limit cognitive processes: the mind is embodied. 
While it emerges from the body as a whole, in addition to the brain, cognition is also 
situated, since it also needs the environment to emerge, it is embedded [20]. Once 
knowledge is embedded, it depends a lot on the physical and socio-cultural milieu; 
cognition is extended to the environment. The environment defines the cognitive load 
among other beings and technologies [13, 32]. Finally, based on these three previous 
principles, there is an enactive knowledge, since knowledge is formed through co-
adaptive couplings between beings and their environment. Although these principles 
overlap and build, they are often referred to collectively as 4E´s model of cognition 
[20, 32, 39, 40]. 
As improvisation is argued as a situated practice that embraces adaptivity, 
contingency, and the unexpected [40],  an exploration of improvisation through the 4E
´s model may reveal new perspectives on teaching, learning, and assessment that 
could have profound implications for the future of musical education [36, 39].
2.3 Autopoiesis 
The concept of autopoiesis considers the adaptive capacity of living systems to their 
environment as an intelligent cognitive process [1, 26]. Autopoiesis is a way for a 
system to recursively self-organize and self-create within a boundary; a system that, 
with its available resources, can reproduce itself within its given constraints [26]. In

Intersection between the 4E`s Model and DMIs

autopoietic concept, this information exchange, is the concept of structural coupling 
which refers to the relation between systems and their environments [33].
Figure 1. presents the autopoiesis concept metaphorized by Ouroboros [35], an ancient 
symbol characterized by a serpent eating its tail representing eternal cycles. 
Figure 1. Ouroboros as a metaphor for autopoietic systems. 
In being embodied, embedded, and extended, cognition is also enactive. Andrea 
Schiavo writes that this means that living systems are not simply answering the 
environment demands, rather they bring forth their domain of meaning through the 
development of routine actions that are guided by principles related to the organism’s 
internal coherence (e.g., homeostasis, thermodynamics, regulation, nutrition, 
reproduction) [32]. This epistemological view of a more expressive experience

supported by technology invites us to reconsider the role of DMIs in musical 
educational practice [25, 41]. 
3. DMIs – MUSICAL APPRENTICESHIP
Robert Jack et al., affirm that learning an instrument involves internalizing how action 
translates to sound, which is initially acquired by exploring and manipulating the 
instrument with somewhat arbitrary actions that lead to unexpected results [16]. 
McPherson et al., write that a designed digital musical instrument (DMI) can provide 
an immersive and embodied musical experience without prior training, opposed to the 
hundreds of hours needed to achieve basic tone production on many acoustic 
instruments [27]. 
The design of musical instruments to make performance accessible to novice 
musicians is a goal that predates digital technology [27]. Although the discussion of 
the DMIs design within skills development, practice, mapping and the different layers 
of feedback is mostly focusing on the art of performance, a large number of DMIs  are 
designed with varying degrees of applicability in the educational practice [29].
The diversity in the framework of DMIs design can adopt several typologies related to 
a range of categories. For example: Inter-actors involved in a performative ecology 
using a DMI; the interaction input control (e.g.,  gestures, gloves, keyboards,  mobile 
phones et al.,); the control parameters (e.g., pitch, duration, dynamics, timbre, vibrato, 
other audio effects)  and the typology of the system, ranging from sequenced to 
generative responses [29] are dimensions adopted from [4, 11, 23].
Schacher affirm that it is clear that a digital musical instrument is constituted by more 
dimensions than just the physical and that these dimensions are also capable of 
eliciting perceptual experiences and even insights. It embeds musical culture and 
musical work practices considering that its framework is designed within  a wide 
range of dimensions and the result will be informed by the conceptual capabilities and 
contextual choices of its creator [38]. 
There are several motivations that boost musicians and designers to build their 
instruments, among them:  bring greater embodiment to the activity of performing and 
producing electronic music; improve audience experiences of DMI performances; 
sound synthesis development; build responsive systems for improvisation [12] and 
promoting new pedagogical approaches [29].

The focus on improvisational musicianship using DMIs for education, responds to a 
broader demand to 21st  century apprenticeship [9, 19, 27]. If the body plays a key 
role in determining musical learning [31], so does the socio-material and cultural 
environment in which it is embedded. 
DMIs expand the traditional acoustic instruments and challenge the musical practice 
towards new corporeality, materiality, control and feedback [29]. An enactive approach 
applied to DMI design comprises users and interfaces immersed in a shared autonomy 
system, so both co-evolve from the experience of interaction [30]. The machine ability 
regulates the control input which include, for example, gestures, tangible user 
interface,  sensors,  keyboard, sound, joysticks, gloves, VR glasses, semi-haptic and 
haptic interfaces, and respond to this through its actuator [29]. An autonomous DMI is 
represented by the interface and the performer coupled through their 
sensors/actuators resulting in an embodied system [30].
Dobrian & Koppelman write that in trying to design an instrument that will enable 
expression, it is necessary to consider how the performer will provide musical 
expression, notably how the performer’s gesture will affect the sound [10]. Figure 2. 
represents the flow of information between the source and the sensorimotor gestural 
feedback within an enactive interface.

[5].
The 4E`s model  in DMIs is not only related  to the feedback between action and 
perception, it is also linked to how this sensorimotor loop, which is an autopoietic 
property,  is translated to the symbolic domain under which it operates the system 
control and instrument processing [30]. The communication between the performer´s 
gesture and the DMI sound response will determine the cohesion of the established 
temporary unity.  Technologically enhanced listening accompanied by gestural 
feedback may become a tool of great significance for learners in the 21st century [13, 
19, 31]. Existing between the acts of musical study, the practice of performing and 
listening through DMIs [24, 25]  may provide music learners with a profound 
perception and sensibility for music that can shift the way they get into listening, 
improvising, performing and any activity that involves an aural sensibility [19, 27].  
4. THE 4E`s MODEL WITHIN MUSIC IMPROVISATION
Thor Magnusson writes that “the analysis of digital music systems has traditionally 
been characterized by a phenomenological approach. The focus has been on the body 
and its relationship to the machine, often neglecting the system’s conceptual design” 
[22]. His work investigates the epistemic nature of digital musical instruments 
dimensions. From an epistemological or music-theoretical perspective, his work 
addresses the culture-theoretical aspects that so prominently define their nature 
within eight axes: Expressive Constraints, Autonomy, Music Theory, Explorability, 
Required Foreknowledge, Improvisation, Generality and Creative-Simulation.  The 
Improvisation axis indicates the degree to which the instrument lends itself to free 
improvisation. How responsive is it, how open for changes in real time performance 
and how quickly can it be adapted to those? [22].
The improvisation axis from the epistemic dimension space by Thor Magnusson, which 
is based on the work from Birnbaum et.al [3] is demonstrated in  Figure 3.

Thor Magnusson. 
Considering the improvisation axis and the DMI control input addressed through  
bodily motion, we propose an overview of digital musical instruments. In order to 
provide novel insights that may help inspire a richer understanding of what musical 
learning through improvisation within DMIs entails, the following aspects (or 
questions) concerning the 4E`s model are described:

• Embodied: focuses on the body-instrument relationships and understandings  
outlined by the DMI`s design. An embodied account describes music perception and 
musical action not as divorced, an intuition for melodic/harmonic/rhythmic involving 
more than the brain [13]. 
• Embedded: represents the amount of music possibilities explored and developed in  
physical, sonic, historical, social, cultural and gendered world(s) [40]. How can a DMI 
be an effective improvisational tool considering the environment and all musical 
genres such as the carnatic music, cumbia, or simply bossa nova? 
• Enactive: represents how much of depth the DMI  holds within the  capabilities-in-
action. This factor regards how the engagement with the instrument  affects the 
learning curve [32].  How can the DMI transform the ways we  engage with the world 
musically, sonically, socially, emotionally and so on? 
• Extended: Specifies how our creative possibilities can be enhanced through  
interactions with co-performers, technologies, and other non-organic ecological 
factors. How can a DMI  help to facilitate the musical creative development? An 
Extended phenomenon emerges in relation with devices and environments that co-
constitute music-like behaviors (and not only “afford” them) [13, 41].
The 4E`s model applied to DMIs design comprises users and interfaces immersed in a 
shared autonomy “autopoietic” system, so both co-evolve from the experience of 
interaction. An autonomous DMI is, therefore, an embodied system that satisfies its 
internal goals through its actions in the environment [30]. The enactive approach 
provides new possibilities for DMIs design considering the human interaction in the 
social cultural milieu. 
5. DMIS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF MUSICAL IMPROVISATION AND THE 
4E`s MODEL
In this section, we illustrate how some digital musical instruments can be seen through 
the 4E`s model and the autopoiesis concept. Naturally, this is a subjective approach, 
and would ideally be performed by way of user surveys [3]. We took the two examples 
of DMIs from a catalogue compiled across all editions of the International Conference 
on New Interfaces for Music Expression (NIME) with varying degrees of DMI 
applicability in the educational practice  [29]. A toolkit for prototyping new digital 
musical instruments, PROBATIO, is also evaluated on our rough analysis.

Wireless sensor interface and gesture-follower for music pedagogy is a gestural 
interface built to support music pedagogy in a framework for the conductor 
apprenticeship [2]. The system continuously synchronises a chosen sound file to a 
conducting gesture performed with the wireless module. The control input of this 
system, the gestures, are in our context, a high level embodied  framework of a DMI, 
promoting intense interactive feedback between action and perception. This DMI, as it 
seems, is focused on Western music context, hence it  is not embedded. The 
conducting gestures provide a way of interacting with the music including implied 
structure of beats and tempo, and these movements are learned; therefore, we hold an 
opinion that it is an enactive system. As the system stimulates adequate motion and 
creative potential, we may consider it an extended DMI. The system is presented on 
Figure 4.

AMIGO is a digital musical instrument to learn to improvise melodies through note 
suggestions [8]. Gradation colors (from yellow to red) guides the user on a physical 
keyboard mounted with a LED stripe. From the 4E`s model perspective, AMIGO can be 
considered bordering on an embodied instrument since it promotes continuous 
integration of sensorimotor activity (action-as-perception). It cannot be thought of as 
an embedded tool since it is related only  to Western music formalisms, hence it does 
not boost adaptive behavior within the socio-material and culture niche we may 
inhabit.  It is a DMI with enactive properties since it offers capabilities-in-action for the 
learning music process through improvisation and music theory contents as shown in 
Figure 5. Lastly, it has  extended aspects since it is an intuitive tool for the  creation of 
musical structures. Its main aim is to stimulate the learning musical process through 
improvisation; in our rough analysis we consider it as an extremely extended DMI.

PROBATIO is  an open-source toolkit for prototyping new digital musical instruments 
[6]. The toolkit  comprises a set of blocks, bases, hubs, and supports that, when 
combined, allows designers, artists, and musicians to experiment with different input 
devices for musical interaction in different positions and postures. We can contemplate 
PROBATIO as an embodied toolkit since it promotes a richly multi-sensory experience 
to musical  improvisation and practice, increasing one's imagination between 
movement, feeling and motivation. This toolkit can be situated because it can be used 
in any environment.  Playable in a wide range of musical genres, we regard this toolkit

to be embedded. In being embedded, the manifold possibilities offered by this toolkit 
can  develop one's understandings of a broader socio-cultural environment for 
improvising collaboratively. The enactive property in this toolkit is within its attributes 
for new meanings of musicality and sonically through music making. We assume this 
toolkit has much potential for improvising and may stimulate the learning music 
process. Finally, the toolkit is an extended instrument providing many musical creative 
possibilities as shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6. Example of  possible combinations of blocks and bases in Probatio 
v0.2.
As the radial chart reveals in Figure 7., the PROBATIO system is within the 4E`s model 
approach in all its characteristics. The main reason for this result is the embedded 
aspect that is not established within the two other examples.

Although the three systems are within the extended approach, we considered the 
PROBATIO and AMIGO in a higher degree than the Wireless sensor interface and 
gesture-follower for music pedagogy as its creative properties were not clearly 
established in the paper.
5. DISCUSSION
Toward the aim of a meaningful music pedagogy through the 4E`s model within DMIs, 
we suggest designers and musicians a reflection upon the following questions:
• Embodied - How can the sonic/musical result of the DMI developed from the 
body/mind movement provide new perceptions and experiences that provoke melodic, 
harmonic and rhythmic intuition [12]?
• Embedded - Would it be possible to improvise in another milieu with other 
instruments of a given culture with the DMI? What roles does the DMI in different 
socio-cultural environments?

17
• Enactive - Which contributions have the DMI to improve the capabilities-in-action of 
the sensorimotor capacity to improvise?
• Extended - What are the DMI creative possibilities to enhance or make possible 
interactions with co-performers, technologies, and other non-organic ecological factors 
[13]? How the DMI can help to facilitate the creative development?
6. CONCLUSIONS 
We believe that the underlying theoretical and conceptual foundation of the 4E`s 
model within the design of DMIs and autopoietic concept can contribute to the 
contemporary social challenges supporting the skills and needs of 21st century music 
learners. The enactive music cognition to improvisation detailed above does not offer a 
fixed method of assessment; nevertheless, we hope that it will resonates with a rich 
pool of ideas and research for DMIs designers and musicians.
