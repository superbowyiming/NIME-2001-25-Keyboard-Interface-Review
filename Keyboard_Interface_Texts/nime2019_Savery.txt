ABSTRACT
Harriet Padberg wroteComputer-Composed Canon and Free
Fugue as part of her 1964 dissertation in Mathematics and
Music at Saint Louis University. This program is one of the
earliest examples of text-to-music software and algorithmic
composition, which are areas of great interest in the present-
day ﬁeld of music technology. This paper aims to analyze
the technological innovation, aesthetic design process, and
impact of Harriet Padberg’s original 1964 thesis as well as
the design of a modern recreation and utilization, in or-
der to gain insight to the nature of revisiting older works.
Here, we present our open source recreation of Padberg’s
program with a modern interface and, through its use as an
artistic tool by three composers, show how historical works
can be eﬀectively used for new creative purposes in con-
temporary contexts. Not Even One by Molly Jones draws
on the historical and social signiﬁcance of Harriet Padberg
through using her program in a piece about the lack of rep-
resentation of women judges in composition competitions.
Brevity by Anna Savery utilizes the original software design
as a composition tool, and The Padberg Piano by Anthony
Caulkins uses the melodic generation of the original to cre-
ate a software instrument.

1. INTRODUCTION
In 1964, Harriet Padberg completed the ﬁrst dissertation on
algorithmic composition using a computer, Computer Com-
posed Canon and Free Fugue , which converted text inputs
into melodies using a custom algorithm. This work stood
out at the time for using a text-to-music mapping instead of
the random number generation based systems used in her
contemporaries’ pieces, e.g. Illiac Suite by Lejaren Hiller[6].

It received moderate attention in the years following its
creation, including a 1968 sonic realization by Max Matthews
[3] and mention in a 1970 survey of computer-generated mu-
sic by Lejaren Hiller [7]. However, in the present, her work
has largely been forgotten; it is not commonly known, nor
spoken about outside of select papers, and a single recre-
ation of the fugue according to the score tables and code
included in the dissertation was published accompanying
Computer Music Journal, vol. 35, no. 4. The delay of its in-
clusion until a 2011 issue, 47 years after the dissertation was
published [8], presents not only a lack of attention towards
a signiﬁcant historical work but also the loss of opportunity
to learn from and adapt it for new musical creations.
In this paper, we present a history ofComputer Composed
Canon and Free Fugue , describe its underlying technology
and aesthetic characteristics, and discusses its broader im-
pact, or lack thereof. We also present an open-sourced recre-
ation of the algorithm, implemented in Python 3.7 1, along-
side three examples of its use in compositions by modern
composers. Each use represents a general mode by which
older technology can be repurposed into a new context with
new meaning.
The ﬁrst composition, Not Even One , by Molly Jones,
shows how the context around a historical piece of tech-
nology can act as a lens through which we can view con-
temporary issues, as well as confer contextual meaning onto
its outputs. Brevity, by Anna Savery, shows how the func-
tion of a piece of technology, independent of context, can
be useful for imbibing work with hidden meaning, and how
the particular aesthetic of an older work can still be desire-
able long past its deprecation. Finally, The Padberg Piano
by Anthony Caulkins shows how key concepts from older
works still serve as wells of inspiration, and can inspire cre-
ative technical adaptations such as the conception of a new
tuning system.
We contend that recreations of historical works allow for
better understanding of technical and aesthetic practices of
the past. Using these works in a modern context is fruitful
both for creators and listeners concepts, sounds and ideas
are revisited. The historical re-contextualization of work
also allows new understandings of current work and climate
through comparison to past creations.
2. ORIGINAL WORK
2.1 Background
Harriet Padberg (November 13, 1922 - January 2, 2014)
spent her life as a member of the ministry of a Roman
1https://www.python.org/
423
Catholic women’s congregation titled the Society of the Sa-
cred Heart. She received a PhD in mathematics and music
from Saint Louis University, after which she became a pro-
fessor at Maryville University in St. Louis. Padberg’s PhD
dissertation, Computer-Composed Canon and Free-Fugue ,
written in 1964, is likely the ﬁrst dissertation on computer
algorithmic composition. In this work, Padberg combined
traditional music theory methods with a novel text-to-music
algorithm, contrasting the stochastic approaches that were
widely used at the time.
During her following tenure at Maryville, she would fur-
ther advance the use of computer music through her estab-
lishment of the university’s Music Therapy program along-
side Ruth Sheehan [9], paving the way for the creation of
its Occupational Therapy and Speech-Language Pathology
programs [2] a few years later. The Music Therapy program
would steadily expand during its ﬁrst ten years, including
the creation of a work study program allowing students to
gain professional experience in the ﬁeld while studying[9].
Padberg herself worked as a therapist as well, and addi-
tionally went on to begin her own music ministry in 1992
[1].
2.2 Technology
Computer Composed Canon centers around an algorithm
written in FORTRAN [11] which mapped text to pitch,
rhythm and musical phrasing.
The ﬁrst part of the algorithm reads in up to 160 charac-
ters of text [10, 4], and maps each constituent letter to an
integer which indexes a length 24 table of frequencies con-
sisting of partials 24 through 47 of the overtone series for
some root note. The letter Y is mapped to the letter I on its
ﬁrst appearance, and to the letter Z for subsequent appear-
ances. Additionally, the letters W and V are assigned the
same frequency. During this same pass, the input is divided
into blocks containing words of ﬁve or more letters each, and
words with less than ﬁve letters adjoined with neighboring
words to form longer blocks. Each letter is assigned a block
number, and an index into their assigned block [10].
Once this mapping is determined, a second pass is per-
formed during which a number of other meta-data is ex-
tracted from the text, including the number of vowels and
consonants per block, the total number of vowels and con-
sonants for the entire phrase, and the number of notes in
each octave. The set of blocks, starting from the beginning
of the input phrase, whose constituent letters sum to less
than or equal to 24 are used as a “tone row”, as well as the
melody line of the Canon. Repeating letters in the tone row
are mapped to the same note in a diﬀerent octaves accord-
ing to the number of repetitions and whether that number
of repetitions is odd or even, making each pitch in the “tone
row” unique. The rhythm of the melody is derived via a
process that takes into account the relative primality of the
length of the tone row, and the number of vowels, conso-
nants and blocks it contains.
The algorithm outputs the composition on a punch card
with two columns, one of which speciﬁes the melody in a
piano roll format with time divided into “ticks” representing
a constant time span. Note lengths are speciﬁed by number
of ticks in which the note is a “on”. The other denotes “the
number of units of the rhythmic pattern”. The melody line
is repeatedly written to the cards in an overlapping fashion,
with each successive line beginning one measure after the
beginning of the preceding line [10].
The original program was written for and run on the
IBM 1620, which was an inexpensive scientiﬁc computer
that could store 20-60 thousand digits at a time. Due to
space constraints, the algorithm was eventually moved to
an IBM 7072, where it underwent some technical changes
to generalize its process such that it could generate not only
Canons, but“Free-Fugues”for two or three voices as well [4].
Though Padberg’s algorithm is surely the ﬁrst composi-
tion technologically realized speciﬁcally on the IBM 1620
and 7072, it is predated by other uses of computers for al-
gorithmic composition. David Caplin and Dietrich Prinz
ran some of the very ﬁrst experiments composing music
with computers in 1955. They created an implementa-
tion of Mozart’s dice game among other probabilistic music
programs [3]. A few years later, Martin Klein and Dou-
glas Bolitho created a program called Push Button Bertha
which randomly output numbers, representative of chro-
matic pitch classes, and structured them using a set of hard-
coded rules [7]. Hiller and Isaacson’s Illiac Suite preceded
Padberg’s work by seven years. However, their work sought
to use the computer to produce notes and phrases which
could be arranged by musicians, whereas Padberg’s algo-
rithm is meant to produce complete pieces of music on its
own [3]. Milton Babbit’s work with the RCA Mark II simi-
larly used the computer in composition for its precision and
mathematical translation abilities. Babbit’s serialism fea-
tures greatly throughout Padberg’s thesis, providing clear
inﬂuence for many of her algorithmic and aesthetic choices
[10].
2.3 Aesthetics
The aesthetics ofComputer Composed Canon and Free Fugue,
reﬂecting the aesthetics of Padberg herself at the time, are
rooted in Western Classical music tradition, particularly
20th-century Serialism are described within. Padberg’s in-
terest in Serialism was rooted in her educational and cul-
tural backgrounds: she completed Masters degrees in both
Musicology and Mathematics. As a devout Catholic, she
was fond of the ancient Greek philosophies around the as-
sociations between mathematics, music, and the heavens. In
her dissertation, Padberg describes Serialism as a method
by which to “re-discover” from Pythagoras the inherent re-
lation of music and mathematical models. Her choice of the
name, “Canon” to describe the piece is derived from use of
the term in music literature, wherein it typically refers to a
melody which reoccurs at a set interval underneath itself; a
common technique in 12-tone music. The term “free-fugue”
however is not used literally. Instead, she uses the term to
refer to multiple melodies appearing and crossing over one
another[10].
Her decision to map letters to pitches draws on J.S. Bach’s
Unﬁnished Fugue, in which Bach famously built his own
name into musical text, as well as later tributes to this work
by Anton Webern, Robert Schumann, and Arnold Schoen-
berg[10]. These works were created using a direct mapping
in German musical notation - A to A, B to Bb, C to C, on-
wards, with H mapping to B Natural. These text to music
mappings vary from those used by Padberg, who did not as-
sociate pitch name directly with its text representation with
the exception of A natural, which was mapped to 440 Hz.
Padberg chose to use a 24-microtonal scale, largely based
on the relation between characters in the alphabet and the
capability of controlling with software, yet does not state
any speciﬁc composer or work as the inspiration.
Padberg also drew inspiration from other past experi-
ments in algorithmic composition. Inﬂuenced by the Illiac
Suite, she also drew on the work of John R. Pierce and M.E.
Shannon from Bell Labs and Richard C. Pinkerton at the
University of Florida. From Bell Labs she describes three
chance pieces, however criticizes them as “nothing very in-
teresting either because the music is too surprising, too ran-
dom, too unpredictable”[10].

3. PYPADBERG
PyPadberg2 is an open-source recreation and interpreta-
tion of Padberg’s dissertation written in Python. The pro-
gram contains modules for parsing text, mapping frequen-
cies and calculating rhythms as well as synthesizing resul-
tant melodies. PyPadberg contains a full screen ASCII in-
terface which runs in terminal. The remainder of this sec-
tion describes the program and its implementation in detail.
3.1 Synthesis
To allow users to hear back and export audio of created
melodies we included a simple synthesis engine. The engine
uses pitch shifting and time-stretching to act as a simple
sample player. Three wave ﬁles are included with the pro-
gram: a violin sound, a sine-wave based synth sound, and
an 8-bit sound. Users are encouraged to add their own ﬁles
into the sample engine.
3.2 Interface
We packaged our implementation in a python application
with a full screen ASCII user interface that runs in terminal.
The interface was created using the Asciimatics library 3,
which provides convenient access to low level console func-
tionality and high level APIs for creating animations and
widgets, and implementing various types of interactivity.
We speciﬁcally chose to develop an ASCII terminal based
interface in order to emulate the simplicity and minimalism
of older computer interfaces. Admittedly, this aesthetic is
misplaced in this context, as Padberg’s program predated
digital interfaces of any kind. At the time, Padberg did not
even have the ability to hear her own outputs; her program
output results in the form of punch cards. We had consid-
ered creating a visual element out of faith to the original
work, though in the end concluded that it would have been
diﬃcult and impractical.
Our interface consists of four screens - a splash screen,
a text input screen, a processing screen, and a rendering
screen, each of which is described below.
3.2.1 Splash Screen and Text Entry
The splash screen, which appears when the application is
launched, displays the application title“PyPadberg”in large
block letters over an image. The image is “Woman Oper-
ating an IBM 1620 Data Processing System,” from the De-
Carlo Photograph Collection , which is in reference to the
IBM 1620 computer on which Padberg originally imple-
mented her algorithm.
The text entry screen consists of a short introduction to
the application followed by a large text box in which a user

3https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics
Figure 1: The processing screen in the PyPadberg
Application, displaying how characters are mapped
to frequencies and rhythms.
can enter text. Our application departs from the original
described by Padberg in that we do not limit the entry to 60
characters, which was simply a limitation of the IBM 1620
rather than a creative choice by Padberg. Buttons at the
bottom of the screen allow the user to either submit their
entered text for processing or quit the application.
3.2.2 Processing
After the user submits their text on the text-entry screen, it
is processed by our algorithm. Each major step of the text
processing part of the algorithm generates a log which is
saved in a list, and then displayed on the processing screen.
The processing screen (Fig. 1) contains a scrollable list
displaying the processing logs, giving the user a window into
some of the inner-workings of the program. It displays to
what frequency and rhythm value each character is mapped.
A “Continue” button at the bottom of the screen allows the
user to move on to the next screen once they have had a
chance to look over the logs.
3.2.3 Rendering
The rendering screen allows the user to select options for
rendering the processed text into audio, including selecting
a sample instrument for the melody, and a number of voices
if the user would like to play the melody back as a psuedo-
fugue or psuedo-canon. A playback option, which plays the
audio according to the selected options in-terminal, is given
at the bottom of the panel. The generic names of the sam-
ples (one, two and three) allow the user to seamlessly swap
in their own custom samples if they so desire by renaming
the sample as any of those numbers and placing it in the
src/assets/audio subdirectory of the application.
Following the playback options, a text box is provided
for the user to enter a name for saving ﬁles, with options
provided at the bottom of the panel. The user is given
the option to save their melody as a CSV ﬁle for use with
Max/MSP, or as a wav ﬁle. When saving a CSV, regard-
less of the number of voices selected, only the monophonic
melody derived from the text is saved.
The ﬁnal two buttons in the bottom panel allow the user
to return to the text-entry screen or quit the application.
4. PADBERG REPURPOSED
Here we describe three compositions created using PyPad-
berg that demonstrate approaches to adapting a historical
work for new contexts. Not Even One , submitted by Molly
Jones, is an example of repurposing the historical and so-
cial context of the work by using the recreated composi-
tion program in a piece of music about the representation
425
of women in the industry of music technology. Brevity by
Anna Savery represents the reuse of an older work as a tool
for composition with a performer. The Padberg Piano by
Anthony Caulkins takes the concept of automatic composi-
tion from the original work in a new direction by creating
an interactive software instrument.
4.1 Not Even One
Not Even One, by Molly Jones, was created as a submission
to the 2nd Iannis Xenakis International Electronic Music
Competition 4. After discovering that the panel of judges
selected for the competition consisted entirely of men, Jones
decided to use the PyPadberg program to express the idea
that women are a signiﬁcant and under-appreciated part of
the ﬁeld of electronic music, and thus the presence of gender
diversity in this judging panel is not only important, but
necessary.
After being made aware of Harriet Padberg via an invita-
tion to create a composition using the PyPadberg program,
Jones discovered the surprising lack of information avail-
able about her despite Padberg’s important place in the
history of electronic and computer music - As mentioned,
Padberg authored the ﬁrst dissertation on algorithmic com-
puter composition, and was a pioneer in the ﬁeld of music
therapy. A Google search of “Harriet Padberg” yields few
related results, the top listed of which are obituaries, or lo-
cal news articles written in response to her death. She does
not have a Wikipedia entry.
Jones felt that Padberg’s obscurity was a ﬁtting represen-
tation of how, despite the long standing presence of women
in, and the contributions of women to electro-acoustic mu-
sic, the inclusion of women in organizations and events re-
lated to electro-acoustic music is seen as a novelty; if the
perception is that women are new, or outsiders to the ﬁeld,
then their presence is non-required. Thus, the use of Py-
Padberg as a tool in the composition is a perfect thematic
ﬁt.
Jones began by feeding in three text patterns into the Py-
Padberg program and rending their corresponding melodies
using a recording of herself speaking the phrase, “The Xe-
nakis Competition has no Women Judges,” a polyphonic
synthesizer, and the prepackaged violin sample. The text
patterns themselves are not semantically meaningful, but
were developed through trial and error for the melodies
they created through the program. She then saved three
and four voice canon/fugue versions of each pattern as wav
ﬁles, and arranged them in Ableton Live 5. The composi-
tion was built primarily around the four voice canon/fugue
version of one of the three patterns rendered with the voice
recording, with pitched and shifted versions of the other
renderings used for ornamentation, accent and layering.
The creation and submission of this piece was not meant
to be seen as an act of aggression, or of mockery. Jones
hoped only to provide a reminder to the Competition of the
importance of gender diversity and female inclusion, and
desires that it instead be taken as a constructive criticism.
On the creation of this piece and the use of the PyPad-
berg program, Jones remarked, “It is an ongoing duty to
challenge the exclusion of innovative voices from present
and past narratives, and I am happy to see that duty being
carried out in the form of the PyPadberg program.”
4.1.1 Author’s Notes on Not Even One
It is worth noting that PyPadberg was created without in-
tention to frame the work as an attempt to change gender
4http://xenakis.web.auth.gr/rules/
5https://www.ableton.com/en/
imbalances in representation. The work was created solely
to recreate one of the ﬁrst algorithmic computer composi-
tions for the beneﬁt of the authors and future users, and
not as an attempt to beneﬁt the system’s creator.
4.2 Brevity
Brevity, by Anna Savery, is a audio-visual piece which draws
heavily on the Ben Folds songStill Fighting It using PyPad-
berg to create a melody from its lyrics which acts as a base
for tribute and reinterpretation.
Still Fighting It was dedicated to Folds’ son and describes
Folds’ feelings about fatherhood, childhood, and watching
his son grow. The accompanying music video contains a
great deal of home video footage of Folds’ son as a young
child, around the time of the song’s writing, and all non-
candid footage shot speciﬁcally for the music video was
made to have a similar aesthetic. As such, it serves as a
beautiful encapsulation of a particular time and focus in
Folds’ life and the life of his child. Savery desired to create
a similar tribute to her own young daughters, seven months
old and three years old at the time of this writing, encapsu-
lating their early childhoods and expressing her own feelings
about them and about parenthood while paying respects to
the original work by Folds.
Savery selected a set of personally meaningful lyrics from
Still Fighting It as inputs to PyPadberg in order to create a
melody from which to build out the rest of her composition.
After saving the melody data as a CSV ﬁle, she recorded
herself playing the melody live on several instruments and
sampled those recordings along with recordings of her chil-
dren’s voices and recordings of them playing with their toys
for arrangement and manipulation in Ableton Live. For the
visual component, she created a matching set of video snip-
pets comprised of custom visuals and processed clips from
her own home videos which was loaded into Max/MSP 6.
In order to closely relate the music and visuals such that
their interaction would express a narrative, albeit one ab-
stract and deeply personal, Savery co-manipulated them,
simultaneously interpreting the same CSV data from Py-
Padberg as two separate but aligned sets of instructions.
Live enabled her to make micro-tonal pitch manipulations
that were faithful to the system speciﬁed by Padberg’s al-
gorithm.
Savery felt that using the PyPadberg program enabled
her to capture and express the chaotic tendencies of child-
hood through the ﬁlter of Padberg’s micro-tonal program.
In her own words, “Children are notoriously noisy, and this
tendency is ampliﬁed by their ever expanding collection of
acoustic and battery operated toys. I wanted to capture
that chaos by playing with some of these toys and altering
[their sounds] with the inﬂuence of PyPadberg.”
4.3 The Padberg Piano
The Padberg Piano, a new instrument and compositional
system by Anthony Caulkins, was designed to build upon
the algorithm and letter-pitch organization outlined by Pad-
berg. While a standard piano has twelve keys within an
octave, the Padberg Piano takes 24 keys (or two regular oc-
taves) to repeat a pitch, as shown in (Fig 2.). The term
octave is chosen, despite not representing a standard scale,
due to its use when describing repeated notes in diﬀerent
registers.
The Padberg Piano is software instrument built within
the Kontakt platform and can be accessed as a plugin within
most audio software. As this instrument is designed with
a piano keyboard in mind, it is possible to compose music
6https://cycling74.com/
426

Figure 3: Inversionally Symmetrical Interval
Classes
in standard notation to be played as if it were a traditional
piano. However, many of the notes on the page will not
correspond to the pitches coming from the piano. Thus the
Padberg Piano is a transposing instrument.
4.3.1 Composing with The Padberg Piano
To ease the diﬃculty of moving from a 12 pitch-class system
to 24, Anthony Caulkins has worked to create a systematic
method of composition, drawing on algorithmic processes
described by Padberg as well as Stephen Dembski’s compo-
sitional system - Circles [5]. Dembski’s methods are drawn
upon to design a pseudo-tonality upon which to derive rules
of ’harmony, ’consonance’, and ’dissonance’, as opposed to
the contrapuntal nature of Padberg’s original canons and
’free-fugues’.
4.3.2 Proposal Of A “New Tonal” System
The alphabetical ordering of Padberg’s mappings as shown
in Table 1 can be likened to the 12 pitch-class chromatic
scale of the standard equal temperament system. In both,
adjacent pitch-classes are of interval-class 1 (one semi-tone).
In a 12 pitch-class set, interval-class 1 is inversionally sym-
metrical with interval-class 11, 2 with 10, 3 with 9, and so
on (see Figure 3), so an increase in pitch by interval-class 1
will result in the same pitch-class as a decrease by interval
class 11. Similarly, in a 24 pitch-class set, interval-class 1 is
inversionally symmetrical with 23, 2 with 22, etc.
Another possible ordering of a 12 pitch-class collection
which accounts for each pitch-class is one with an adja-
cency interval-class of 5 (or 7 - its modulo 12 inversion).
This ordering is also known as the Circle of Fourths/Fifths.
Interval-classes 1 and 5 (or 11 and 9) are the only possible
options to account for each of the 12 pitch-classes of the
Figure 4: ’Tonal’ Collections
Figure 5: Non-Adjacent ’Consonances’
chromatic collection. An adjacency interval-class of 11 (or
13 - its modulo 24 inversion) is needed to scale the Circle of
Fourths to the Padberg 24 pitch-class set. Interval-class 11
in the 24 set is analogous to interval-class 5 in the 12 set as
they are both one step away from the interval-class at the
point of symmetry (12 and 6 respectively).
Next, two new orderings based on interval-class adjacency
5 (in the 12 pitch-class set) and 11 (in the 24 pitch-class
set) are created. From here, seven adjacent numbers in the
12 pitch-class collection and 13 adjacent numbers in the
24 pitch-class collection are selected. The chosen letters
are aligned over their positions on the original ’chromatic’
collections. The circled letters in Figure 4 represent the
’tonic’ note of each collection.
At this point, the collections of pitches have been ordered
into scales and related to a larger ’chromatic’ collections.
The circled letters in the 12 pitch-class (ﬁgure 4) collection
makeup a Bb scale. Similarly, the Padberg alphabet is now
organized into a ’tonal’ system, complete with a transpos-
able scale of whole and half steps, with the letter B as the
’tonic’ (ﬁgure 4). ’Consonant’ harmonies can be derived
by connecting non-adjacent notes in each of the ’tonal’ col-
lections. In the 12 pitch-class set, the maximum number
of connectable non-adjacent notes is 3 (which represents a
tonal triad - Bb D F; C Eb G; D F A; etc.). The 24 pitch-
class set will create basic chords of 5 notes, rather than 3
(see Figure 5).
5 notes are used rather than 6 (the maximum possible
number of non-adjacent pitches) to maintain an the impor-
tant tonal property of the gamut, whereby the tonic triad
contains three notes, the dominant contains three notes (one
overlapping the tonic), and the subdominant contains three
notes (with one overlapping the tonic). These three func-
tional harmonies represent all of the pitches of the scale. In
the 24 pitch collection the tonic will be built on B (B F J M
Q), the dominant on Q (Q U A D H), and the subdominant
427

on L (L O S X B).
Now that systems of scale, transposition, consonance, dis-
sonance, and functional harmony have been developed, con-
trapuntal composition can begin. In the spirit of Padberg’s
canons, Caulkins has translated Bach’s ﬁrst keyboard inven-
tion to Padberg’s 24 note system. Unsurprisingly, some dif-
ﬁculties arise when translating music designed for 12 pitch-
classes to 24. Namely, how do scale degrees and functions
move from a smaller system to a larger? Attempting to
maintain the tonic, dominant, and subdominant functions
outlined above, scale degree equivalency from Bach to Pad-
berg is: 1 - 1, 2 - 2, 3 - 5, 4 - 6, 5 - 9, 6 - 11, 7 - 12. This
might seem slightly confusing as there is a certain degree of
arbitrariness in assigning scale degrees 2, 3, and 6. How-
ever, the aim is in maintaining the tonal functions of these
scale degrees as well as possible.
One critical diﬀerence is the range of the Bach/Padberg
is much larger due to the fact that it takes 24 piano keys
to cycle through a full octave. Also, in the Bach/Padberg
score, each accidental is explicitly notated, rather carrying
through a measure. The reason for this is that the 13 note
scale cannot be represented by standard key signatures.
4.3.3 Reﬂections on Padberg Piano
After completing the work, Caulkins reﬂected on using Pad-
berg’s System. “Overall the success of the Padberg Piano is
that it allows for free composition using Padberg’s pitch sys-
tem while giving a composer the freedom to employ “text
to music” processes however they might wish. Obviously
the sound-world of the piano is somewhat foreign to most
music listeners, however when put into the context of a
Bach invention, learning to hear functional shifts (chord
changes, key changes, etc.) becomes fairly intuitive. Diﬃ-
culties surrounding composing for this instrument become
apparent within the context of re-purposing functional har-
mony into a 24 pitch-class system. Certain arbitrary deci-
sions of course have to be made when scaling the standard
tonal system into this new one. However, the product is
something quite learn-able and fulﬁlling.”
5. CONCLUSION
In this work, we discussed the obscure yet historically signif-
icant Harriet Padberg and her 1964 PhD dissertation Com-
puter Composed Canon and Free Fugue , and presented our
own recreation or reinterpretation of her algorithm, PyPad-
berg. PyPadberg has been open sourced both to bring this
algorithm into the present dialog on music technology his-
tory and for modern composers to use. Finally, and most
critically, we’ve presented speciﬁc examples of how com-
posers can use PyPadberg and other historical works as a
basis or tool for new works. The three examples we present
display the use of a PyPadberg for its surrounding narra-
tive, as a means of producing a particular aesthetic, and as
a basis for the re-formalization of aesthetic constructs such
that one can ﬁlter other works through Padberg’s aesthetic
lens.
