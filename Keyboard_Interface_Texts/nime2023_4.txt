ABSTRACT
LoopBoxes is an accessible digital musical instrument de-
signed to create an intuitive access to loop based music mak-
ing for children with special educational needs (SEN). This
paper describes the evaluation of the instrument in the form
of a pilot study during a music festival in Berlin, Germany,
as well as a case study with children and music teachers in
a SEN school setting. We created a modular system com-
posed of three modules that afford single user as well as
collaborative music making. The pilot study was evaluated
using informal observation and questionnaires ( n = 39),
and indicated that the instrument affords music making for
people with and without prior musical knowledge across all
age groups and fosters collaborative musical processes. The
case study was based on observation and a qualitative inter-
view. It confirmed that the instrument meets the needs of
the school settings and indicated how future versions could
expand access to all students. especially those experiencing
complex disabilities. In addition, out-of-the-box functional-
ity seems to be crucial for the long-term implementation of
the instrument in a school setting.

1. INTRODUCTION
Over the past years, there has been a growing trend to-
wards digital musical instruments (DMIs) specifically de-
signed for people with disability experience [9]. Despite

this growing interest, DMIs specifically designed to be used
by children with special educational needs (SEN) in school
settings are still rare. One problem is that most available in-
struments are designed for single-user interaction [9]. How-
ever, SEN school settings typically afford playing music in
groups, where teachers have to orchestrate the different in-
struments, and manage and maintain them in real time.
Accordingly, in a recent large-scale survey conducted in Ger-
many, teachers expressed a preference for simple, modular,
and interactive units that can be played together, rather
than complex individual instruments [12].
Thus, we set out to design an accessible set of DMIs that
fit with the needs of SEN school settings by focusing on
modularity, collaborative music making, tangible interac-
tion, and freely available open source components. This
paper describes the design approach as well as two studies
that informed the iterative design of the DMIs.
Our goal was not only to make the instrument suitable
for use in SEN settings, but also to develop an instrument
that is aesthetically appealing for both individuals with
and without disabilities, to counter the trend of considering
DMIs for this area as a “substandard practice” [5, p. 3].
Thus, we conducted a pilot study at a music festival with
a mixed audience. In the second step, we evaluated the
instrument at a SEN school.
2. RELATED WORK
There are numerous DMIs that have been developed for
people with disability experiences. These instruments are
also referred to as accessible DMIs (ADMIs) [9]. Commer-
cially available options include touchless instruments such
as Soundbeam,1 haptic controllers like Skoog2, breath con-
trolled instruments like the Magic Flute3, or instrument
that use mixed modalities like Touch Chord4, which is both
breath- and touch-controlled. Additionally, there are de-
velopments that are not (yet) commercially available, in-
cluding bespoke instruments like Kellycaster5, an adapted
guitar that allows chord selection by using a keyboard or
AI based instruments [4]. There are also tangible MIDI
controllers designed for education [1] and toolkits that al-
low music teachers to create their own customized music
interfaces [16]. The problem for widespread use is that lit-

Figure 1: First prototype of the step sequencer module
erature shows that for a large part of music teachers such
possibilities are not practical, since instruments not working
plug-and-play are hardly used [6].
Similar developments to ours have been presented in the
literature. Compared to our development, which is intended
to combine both controller and sound generation in the
long run, most of them do not work in standalone mode
[15, 3]. Moreover, others are too large for daily use in
schools (GRIDI 6), take more experimental approaches to
music making [18] or use rather complex visual tracking
technologies that seem less suitable for everyday use [8].
A similar approach to collaborative music making in a
school setting has been presented in [17]. Here, the instru-
ment design was mainly related to well-known acoustic in-
struments (e.g., the pianoor the drum). However, direct ref-
erences to acoustic musical instruments can be problematic.
On the one hand, they are typically oriented towards exist-
ing concepts taken from the original instrument, but reduce
their complexity. In SEN settings, this is sometimes associ-
ated with a deficit-oriented view (“inferior instruments” or
“no ‘real’ instruments”) [13, 5], or as undesired deviations
from cultural notions of “normality” (e.g., ‘normally’ a pi-
ano is not played with a button) [10]. In contrast, deviat-
ing from traditional instrument metaphors allows designers
to instead focus on the unique possibilities of DMIs, while
being able to tailor the interaction to the abilities of the
children. To address this issue, we developed instruments
that use interaction metaphors common in electronic music
making. Further, we decided to test our instrument with
a mixed audience as well as with a group of children in
an SEN setting to ensure the instruments are aesthetically
appealing to a broad user group and thus afford inclusive
music making.
Previous work emphasizes that people with disabilities
need to be involved in the development of technology for
people with disabilities in order to understand their individ-
ual needs [2]. In addition, in a school setting, other stake-
holders are significant: the teachers as well as the broader
school as an institution with specific pedagogical require-
ments. Those requirements were investigated in a compre-
hensive survey of SEN schools [10, 12], which revealed that a
major barrier to using DMIs is a general lack of knowledge
about their possibilities. In addition, there are basically
two different design approaches. Either the development
of generic instruments that are as flexible as possible or
the development of many simple instruments with clear af-
6https://www.gridi.info/
fordances that address different access needs. The survey
showed that for school use the second approach is preferred
by the teachers. Therefore, we decided to develop different
modules in a first step, which enable making music together
and exemplify possibilities of DMIs. These served as a start-
ing point in the course of our project. In the further course,
we want to continue expanding the modules and adapt them
to the individual needs of the students. The goal is to pro-
vide a larger selection of instruments from which teachers
can choose the most suitable ones. Furthermore, the survey
revealed a list of requirements from the perspective of music
teachers in SEN education. These include:
• manageability (ease-of-use, intuitive interaction)
• good sound quality
• financial viability
• robustness
• facilitating discovery learning and aesthetic experi-
ences
• multimodality (multisensory and direct feedback)
• to foster collaborative music making
• appealing design aesthetics
The initial design of LoopBoxes was informed by these
requirements, as described in the next section.
3. INITIAL DESIGN
Figure 2 shows a schematic view of the instrument. To en-
able collaborative music making, the instrument consists of
three modules with distinct functions. Two step sequencer
modules that also work as stand-alone instruments (see [11]
for a detailed description of the design) and afford the cre-
ation of (1) a melodic line and (2) a drum beat. Module
three controls the layers of a background loop, a low- and
high-cut filter, a stutter effect, and it mediates the overall
interaction.
All modules communicate via serial port with a laptop
running a Pure Data patch. The sound was distributed
using a headphone mixer enabling each musician to control
the volume with a separate control knob during the pilot
study. In the SEN school the sound was output using the
sound system that was available in the music room.

3.1 Loop-based Music
We chose a loop-based design, because this way of music
making is the foundation of many popular musical genres
(e.g., Electronic Dance Music (EDM)), and we assumed it
would connect to the children’s listening experiences. In
addition, the non-linear, repetitive approach to music mak-
ing might intrinsically increase accessibility [5]. The instru-
ment provides musical loops from different popular music
genres that we hope correspond to the users’ listening ex-
periences and contribute to the fostering of aesthetic expe-
riences which, following Christopher Wallbaum [19], should
be the purpose of music education.
3.2 Interface Design
Current music education research often focuses on the use
of touchscreen-based interfaces like the iPad [14]. Besides
many advantages (e.g., off-the-shelf availability, standard-
ization), such devices can also be perceived as a barrier by
people with cognitive disabilities [7]. In addition, the cur-
rent, easily available touch-based systems typically rely on
(at least partially) closed-source solutions. This increases
the risk of vendor lock-in and high costs.
As an alternative, we decided to develop the three mod-
ules using tangible interfaces, which have a particularly high
potential to facilitate accessibility [11]. They support intu-
itive interaction by setting restrictions to distinct functions.
In addition, the use of buttons to create direct feedback
(cause and effect) is very common in SEN settings and can
facilitate access for people with cognitive disabilities [20].
Furthermore, the modular design was chosen to foster col-
laborative music making and aesthetic communication [19]
among the users.
The two step sequencers (left and middle in figure 2) pro-
vide primary haptic feedback7 by using wooden blocks that
are put in a preconfigured arrangement of holes (see Figure
1 & 2). Visual feedback is provided by 16 LEDs indicating
the current step that is being played.
Module three consists of five coloured buttons that pro-
vide visual feedback by built-in LEDs. Three white buttons
control different layers of the background loop (bassline,
chords, atmosphere). The blue button skips to the next set
of background loops (altogether, four sets are provided from
different musical genres) and the red button mutes the en-
tire system. The touch slider controls a ‘stutter-effect’ that

a vibration motor.
can be accelerated or decelerated by moving the finger to
the right or left. The tempo of the stutter effect is repre-
sented visually by the speed of blinking LEDs (also at the
two step sequencer modules).

4. PILOT STUDY WITH MIXED AUDIENCE
The first evaluation took place during a public music festival
(Festival f¨ur selbstgebaute Musik8) in Berlin, Germany, in
an informal “market-like” setting outside (see figure 3 for
the setup). This festival aims to be an inclusive place for
adults and children to enjoy and explore all kinds of self-
built musical instruments.
We invited visitors of the festival to try out the instru-
ments and collected feedback based on observation and a
short questionnaire. We were particularly interested in how
users experience the functionality of the instrument, to see
if the instrument is perceived as aesthetically appealing to
a general public, and to receive feedback on our design. We
8https://www.selbstgebautemusik.de/
also wanted to evaluate if the instrument is suited for mu-
sic making without the need of prior training and if the
instrument is suited to foster a collaborative music making
process.
For the evaluation, we designed a short questionnaire (see
Figure 9), focused on the main design considerations of the
instrument. The rating scale used to evaluate the nine as-
pects had two options: “not at all” to “very much” for item
1 or to “completely” for items 2 through 9. Additionally,
we asked for an assessment of the suitable age span of tar-
get users and the respondents’ age, gender, profession, and
musical training as well as qualitative feedback. The ques-
tionnaire was available in German and English. In addition,
we observed the people using the instruments and talked to
many of them in person.
4.1 Observations
The participants who used the instrument ranged from very
young children (approximately 3 years) to adults over 60.
Most people used the instrument for 10 to 30 minutes. We
observed families forming a ‘musical ensemble’ as well as
strangers engaging in a collaborative music process.
In some cases, the timeline metaphor seemed hard to un-
derstand for participants. Generally, this was the case for
very young children, but also for some older children as
well as adults, especially in the following scenario. When
two modules were already being used and a new musician
entered the musical ensemble, it seemed to be hard to grasp
one’s own part in the music. In some cases, we had to ex-
plain the functionality of the different modules to the users,
but in most cases, we observed them explaining to each
other how they perceived the functioning of the instruments.
We also observed the users communicating about aesthet-
ics. For example, one user said that “this one does not fit”
referring to a single block on the step sequencer or another
user said “no, this sounds muddy” referring to the density
of the musical outcome. Furthermore, we observed some
users of module three disturbing/interrupting the others by
changing the background loop or using the stutter-effect
extensively. One very young child tried to stack the blocks
onto each other while using the melodic step sequencer and
seemed to expect feedback on this interaction.
4.2 Questionnaire – Quantitative Evaluation
We received completed questionnaires from 39 participants
(19 male, 17 female, 1 diverse, and 2 unspecified gender in-
dications). The age ranged from 3 to 61 years (¯ x = 34.72,
σ = 11.75). Three children ( age <10) participated in the
evaluation on their own (with permission of their parents),
in other cases they were assisted by their parents. The pro-
fessions varied broadly from (SEN) (music) teachers, (mu-
sic) therapists, social workers, to designers and engineers,
a baker, and others. Around half of our participants in-
dicated no musical training ( n = 17) and the others half
indicated private musical experience ( n = 15) and/or pro-
fessional musical experience ( n = 7).
Figure 4 shows the rating distribution. For the reversed
items 4 and 7, the mean rating is smaller than 2. For all
other items the mean rating is greater than 4.
The minimum age recommendations for the target user
group according to our participants varied between 2 and
12 years (¯x = 5 .61, ˜x = 5, σ = 2 .6). The maximum age
recommendations varied from 10 to 109 years (excluding
one outlier at 180); (¯x = 74.20, ˜x = 99, σ = 38.40). Most of
the participants indicated that the instrument is not only

suited for children, but also for adults ( n = 5 participants
recommended a maximum age below 18).
4.3 Questionnaire – Qualitative Evaluation
Table 1 provides an overview of the indicated positive as-
pects, negative aspects, and requests formulated in the ques-
tionnaire.
4.3.1 Positive aspects
The overall feedback was very positive. Participants indi-
cated that they enjoyed the haptic qualities of the inter-
action. A SEN music teacher wrote that the tangibility
supports the comprehension of the different components of
a beat. In this regard, one participant also mentioned the
absence of a screen as a positive aspect. The direct feed-
back seems to be strongly related to the evaluation of the
instrument as being easy-to-use. Furthermore, the partici-
pants mentioned minimal functions, simplicity, a game-like-
approach and the aspect that “no matter what you do, it
somehow sounds good” in this context. One participant
wrote that the instrument enables ‘all’ people to experi-
ence music-making. Regarding the design, the combina-
tion of visual feedback with light and wood as a building
material was mentioned and seen as positive, and so was
the out-of-the-box functionality. Some participants wrote
about the possibilities of fostering musical learning activi-
ties with the instrument, in the sense that different rhythms
can be tested easily in conjunction with a direct experience.
Additionally, the visualization of abstract concepts like har-
mony and rhythm was mentioned. The SEN music teacher
claimed that the possibility to remove the parts that are not
supposed to sound make the instrument concrete and suit-
able for people with learning difficulties. Another aspect
the participants enjoyed was working with others, including
communication about and through music, opportunities for
interaction, teamwork and generally getting along with dif-
ferent people.
4.3.2 Negative aspects
On the negative side, one participant found module three
“too experimental” and “messy”, proposing more simple ef-
fects like “delay, reverb, echo” as opposed to the stutter
effect provided by the instrument. This participant also
proposed the need for more detailed volume controls for the
drums and the melody. Another aspect that was criticized
is the harmonic domination of the instrument.
4.3.3 Requests
Two participants proposed the extension of including a way
to record ‘your own voice’ to the instrument. Furthermore,
Figure 4: Density plot of the agreement to individual items by respondents on a scale from 0 - not at all - to 5 - completely
a do-it-yourself (DIY) construction kit was desired as well
as the possibility to choose different sounds and to have
some infographics explaining the instrument. The youngest
participant (age = 3) proposed the integration of stackable
blocks as an interaction possibility.
4.4 Intermediate Reflection
The feedback from the pilot study was predominantly pos-
itive. All items of the questionnaire had a strong tendency
to their positive pole, although the inverted items (4 and
7) had more variance including some negative ratings. The
qualitative feedback corresponding directly to the design
requirements formulated by [10, 12] suggests that, overall,
LoopBoxes have successfully met the needs from the respon-
dents point of view.
The least positive rating on the other scales is item 2
- ‘easy to understand’, which can be explained by the fact
that the timeline metaphor requires abstract cognitive skills
and some level of experience interacting with a step se-
quencer. As a consequence, we reduced the melodic se-
quencer to one single row that uses a block-stacking-approach
to determine note pitch (see figure 5). This idea is also based
on our observation of one child intuitively stacking blocks
on top of each other.
5. CASE STUDY IN SEN SCHOOL SETTING
The second field test was a case study of the instrument
with children and music teachers in a SEN school. The
connection with the school was established through an on-
going participatory design project, conducted by the first
author. The evaluation was based on observations during a

class where the children made music together, and a semi-
structured interview (appr. 60 minutes) with one music
teacher.
The project started in September 2022 as a weekly music
workshop, for which the children could register voluntarily.
We deliberately refrained from collecting precise diagnoses
on the children’s disabilities in order to focus on their abil-
ities. Overall, this was a group with highly heterogeneous
abilities in the physical, cognitive and communicative do-
main. Nevertheless, for the discussion of results it seems
necessary to differentiate the observations with regard to
the severity of the disability, since students from the so-
called group of people with complex disabilities (profound
disabilities in all of the domains mentioned above) in par-
ticular experience access barriers. A total of eight children
participated in the project, four of whom are accompanied
by an individual assistant and communicate non-verbally.
Each session started with a common welcome song, after
which the children were invited to try out an instrument.
After making music together, we listened to music of differ-

ent styles, which were evaluated by the children according
to their individual preferences (good, neutral, bad). The
indicated preferences were used to select appropriate musi-
cal styles for the instrument. We ended each session with
singing a song.
Since most of the students communicated non-verbally or
only to a limited extent verbally, observation and image-
based forms of communication were used for evaluation.
The observations were discussed with the individual assis-
tants as proxies during the sessions as well as with one mu-
sic teacher at the end of each session. The second teacher
was involved in the evaluation using a qualitative semi-
structured interview.
It became apparent early on that much more time than
originally planned would be needed to give the children
enough space to explore the instruments. Therefore, only
the drum sequencer and the loop controller could be tested
so far. The effect slider has also not yet been used. However,
the melodic sequencer has been presented to the teachers
and reflected on as part of the interview.
5.1 Results and First Conclusions
Since we worked with a highly heterogeneous group, some
children were able to operate all the instruments’ modules
without difficulty, while for others especially the drum se-
quencers’ abstract form of interaction as well as its fine mo-
tor skill requirements did not seem to be appropriate. Fur-
thermore, some students exhibited exploratory behaviors
with the instruments on their own, while others seemed to
expect more direct instruction by the teachers.
5.1.1 Independent exploration and graphic notation
Initially, we gave the students the opportunity to indepen-
dently explore the functions of the instrument’s separate
modules. For example, one student first placed one block in
each row of the drum sequencer spread out horizontally, ex-
ploring the different sounds (see Figure 6). Another student
placed a snare sound on the first beat, so the rhythm was
perceived to be shifted by one beat. This student explored
different positions for the snare drum and bass drum by
placing one block and then waiting to listen to the feedback.
For those students, the timeline metaphor seemed easy to
understand and the interaction with the instrument itself
seemed to be accessible. After the initial exploration, we
offered graphic notation of rhythms as support (see Figure
7), which could be used as a starting point for exploration.
In this regard, we observed that one student counted off
the rows incrementally as she tried to copy the rhythms.
Therefore, we added visual support to the surface of the
drum sequencer in the form of vertical lines and numbers.
5.1.2 Challenges and opportunities in interaction
Especially for students with complex disabilities, the inter-
action of the instrument seemed to be less suitable. We
observed children experimenting with different (not our in-
tended) forms of interaction. For example, one student
tapped on the wood while exploring the instruments or hit
several lighted buttons with his hand on the loop module
in a rather percussive way. He seemed to particularly en-
joy the direct haptic interaction, but not care for the sonic
feedback from the instrument. This student always carried
a rattle in the shape of a ball in his hand. This impression
was also confirmed by the interviewed music teacher, who
described the drum sequencers as difficult for students with
complex disabilities. At the same time, for all the other
students, he describes the experience as a “totally positive
effect” in which students “form a work of art and create mu-
sic in the process.” In this context, he cites a “higher cre-
ative part”as an advantage of the drum sequencer compared
to the loop sequencer, distinguishing between a conscious
and “random” creative performance. But he also describes
the unintentional creation of a rhythm (i.e., to simply put
wooden blocks without musical intention) as an advantage,
since it enables students who do not (yet) have a feeling for
rhythm to engage in basic creative processes. He empha-
sizes that it is difficult to understand whether or not some
students perceive themselves as sound producers in this con-
text, but that he assumes they understand in “some way”
their influence on the sound. He sees another advantage for
children who generally have difficulties keeping a rhythm
due to motion control limitations. He described the fine
motor requirements as a main disadvantage, although he
contrasts this with the advantage of the melodic sequencer,
as the interaction is more accessible due to the larger size.
The loop module could be operated by all students. How-
ever, as already described in the last example, not all stu-
dents seemed to perform the interaction with the intention
to interact with our intended musical affordances. One stu-
dent rejected the interaction with the loop module by push-
ing the instrument away from herself, but then wanted to
put wooden blocks in the drum sequencer. It remained un-
clear whether she perceived herself as a sound producer. Re-
garding the touch-interaction, the interviewed teacher high-
lighted the aspect that, regardless of motor limitations, the
instrument affords the creation of nice sounds. He described
that as “a great experience”. In addition, he describes the
“big illuminated buttons”as very attractive to students with
complex disabilities.
5.1.3 Collaborative music making
Making music collaboratively using both modules combined
seemed challenging for most students without appropriate
support. For example, we observed one student arranging
different combinations of loops while a beat was laid on the
drum sequencer. Then she stopped interacting for a longer
period of time and it seemed like she did not know what
to do next. As the beat was slowly reduced on the drum
sequencer by taking away blocks, she began to also turn off
the loop layers one by one, creating an effect resembling of
a fade-out. This example shows that some students need
more didactic support to engage in the exploration of col-
laborative music making processes. Besides, the instrument
should be extended by further modules that offer direct hap-
tic interaction as well as direct musical feedback.
The interviewed teacher described the modular design of
the instrument as an overall advantage. He cites the ex-
ample from “regular” music classes, where students with
complex disabilities in particular are mostly excluded from
active music making or participation is limited to simple in-
struments like acoustic drums. According to him, a key ad-
vantage of the modular design of our instrument is that the
modules complement each other in “a certain way”, offer-
ing each student participation in the overall musical result
which is much greater compared to the use of traditional in-
struments. The instrument is therefore particularly suitable
for enabling very heterogeneous groups to actively partici-
pate in making music together.
In this context, he also describes the advantage that by
involving all students in making music, a change in per-
ception of individual students by other students would be
achieved. Hereby he addresses an improvement of social
participation.
5.1.4 Benefits of individual exploration
Another observation we made in relation to the use of the
instrument in group settings is the example of a student
who at times showed basically no interest to participate in
trying out the instrument. For this student, it proved to
be a viable solution to first explore the instrument in an
individual setting. In a conversation with the teacher, it
was confirmed that the barrier did not lie in the instrument
itself, but rather in a general reticence of the student in
social situations. For students with complex disabilities,
the group setting does not seem to be ideal either, as it
is more difficult to perceive their reactions and they often
seemed easily distracted by other students.
5.1.5 Requirements for long-term instrument use
In order to use the musical instrument in the longer term,
the interviewed teacher addresses the need to reduce “tech-
nical dependency” and preparation time. Following him,
it is important that the instruments are ready to use right
away without any preparation required, like a keyboard that
can be turned on with a switch. In addition, he mentioned
the possibility of involving students in the construction of
such instruments within longer-term school projects.
6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
6.1 Overall Evaluation of the Instrument
Both the pilot study and the case study showed that the
instrument met our design criteria for many users, but also
highlighted aspects that should be improved or expanded in
future iterations. Teachers judged the instrument to be a
good way to engage all students in music lessons, including
those who are normally excluded from active music making
during music class, allowing them to receive a significant
role in a collaborative musical work. This suggests that the
instrument can increase access to aesthetic experiences as
well as social participation in the music classroom.
6.1.1 Expanding the instrument’s modules
It was equally apparent that not all interaction possibilities
are accessible or appealing to all students. However, the
modular structure affording various interaction possibilities
was described as a decisive advantage. Therefore, our goal
is to expand the existing modules with additional ones. The
design approach of having many simple instruments, from
which the appropriate ones can then be chosen according
to individual needs, is preferred by most SEN music teach-
ers [12]. For students with complex disabilities, button in-
teraction was evaluated as being the most accessible, and
according to the teacher’s assessment, also very appealing.
But it remained unclear whether the students perceive mu-
sical value for themselves. Therefore, one of the things we
plan to do is to design a ball as an instrument that affords
music making through movement, based on our observation
of a student who regularly interacts with a similar object.
6.1.2 Alternative musical styles and voice inclusion
It turned out that for use in the SEN area, a lot of time
needs to be allocated for instrument exploration. There-
fore, some functions of the instrument and suggestions from
the pilot study could not yet be considered – e.g., proposals
like the reduction of harmonic domination. However, the
musical style of the loops offered was rated well by the stu-
dents. Nevertheless, in the future we are planning to offer
also alternative styles and let the children decide what they
like most. Also, voice inclusion was prepared by adding a
recording function to the pure data patch of the sequencer
and will be tested in the future.
6.1.3 Group vs. individual exploration
It also became apparent that exploration in a group setting
is not the best choice for all children. There were students
who disliked being the center of attention and therefore pre-
ferred to test the instrument alone first. Other children were
quickly distracted by different stimuli. Therefore, an ideal
approach would be to offer exploration in individual as well
as group settings in each session, which unfortunately is only
feasible to a limited extent due to the requirements of the
school. Nevertheless, if possible, we plan to offer additional
individual sessions, especially for the group of students with
complex disabilities.
6.1.4 Scaffolding for collaborative music making
Specifically, to facilitate collaborative music making prac-
tices, it seems necessary to provide didactic material as scaf-
folding for most of the students. For example, the interac-
tion with the loop module seemed accessible to most chil-
dren, but the combination of different musical layers was
an unfamiliar practice. Therefore, didactic materials (see
Figure 8) were developed for future sessions in the form of
graphic notation scores that may be used to visualize or
facilitate the composition of musical sequences.
6.1.5 Aesthetic communication
So far, we have not been able to observe any aesthetic com-
munication [19] among the children, which is probably due
to the children’s predominantly non-verbal communication
abilities and to the discussed need for more direct instruc-
tion. The pilot study showed that aesthetic communication
might be stimulated as soon as the users are sufficiently fa-
miliar with the instruments’ functions. In the SEN context,
this probably requires a lot of preparation time and more
support.

6.1.6 Flexible and easy-to-use technology
Most important for longer-term use in schools, as indicated
by the teachers and in [6], is enabling the instrument to
function independently and being ready for use without ex-
tended preparation time. The idea is to make every single
module run on a raspberry pi, sync via wifi and to be con-
trollable via a web-interface, so that it is easy to use and
remains flexible at the same time.
In the pilot study, the desire for a do-it-yourself-kit build-
ing set was expressed. This aspect was also addressed by
the teacher in the interview. Here, one goal of our design
from wood in conjunction with open source technology was
to enable such projects.
6.2 Summary and Future Prospects
Overall, the results of the pilot study and case study sug-
gest that the instrument was successful in meeting many of
the design criteria and was able to engage all students in
music lessons, including those who are typically excluded
from active music making. The modular structure of the
instrument was also seen as a major advantage and allowed
for flexibility in choosing the appropriate modules for indi-
vidual needs. However, it was also apparent that not all in-
teraction possibilities were accessible or appealing to all stu-
dents, particularly those with complex disabilities. There-
fore, future iterations will focus on expanding the modules
to better serve this population. Since the instrument was
enjoyed by children as well as adults ranging from formally
trained musicians to hobby musicians and people with no
musical experience during the pilot study, we hope that
it could also be aesthetically appealing to children in in-
clusive settings, facilitating collaborative music-making be-
tween children with and without disability experience in the
long term.
7. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We thank Aktion Mensch e. V.for supporting our project
with a financial donation and ueberschall for providing dif-
ferent musical loops. We also thank the participants of the
pilot study as well as the children and music teachers at
our partner school. Furthermore, we thank Achim Rein-
hardt for his support in the development of the improved
melodic sequencer.
8. ETHICAL STANDARDS
All persons who participated in our evaluation did so vol-
untarily. The children’s parents were fully informed about
the project and their rights and gave written consent for
their children to participate. In addition, children were free
to participate or not participate in each session. Especially
with children who communicate non-verbally, their individ-
ual assistants help interpret whether or not a child is willing
to participate or not. Both the teachers and the school ad-
ministration were fully informed about the project and their
rights and gave their written consent.
