Abstract
We introduce the Extended Reality (XR) Musical Keyboard, a sys-
tem allowing users to overlay a virtual keyboard onto a tabletop
surface, such as a standard PC keyboard. This virtual keyboard
is highly customizable: users can freely program the number
of keys and their respective pitches. Modern software instru-
ments offer advanced capabilities, including microtonal scales
(pitches outside the standard 12-tone equal temperament). How-
ever, playing these instruments often remains challenging due to
the lack of corresponding physical hardware. Our proposed solu-
tion addresses this gap by projecting a programmable virtual key-
board onto a tangible object within the XR space. This approach
combines the software’s flexibility with the tactile feedback of a
physical surface, enhancing playability. Users can simplify the
keyboard layout (e.g., fewer keys than a piano) or expand it be-
yond conventional limits to explore new expressive possibilities,
particularly for microtonal music. We conducted a small pilot
study (N=4) involving participants mostly inexperienced with
keyboards to gather preliminary feedback on the interface’s ease
of use for performance.

1 Introduction
Information technology continues to reshape musical interaction,
offering novel tools like software instruments and Digital Audio
Workstations (DAW) for expression. However, a gap often exists

between flexible software capabilities and rigid hardware con-
trollers. For example, software keyboards can be easily resized
or reconfigured, while physical MIDI controllers remain fixed,
limiting the expressive potential offered by software.
This limitation is particularly evident with microtonal mu-
sic. While software instruments can readily simulate microtones
(pitches falling between the standard 12 semitones), conventional
hardware controllers like MIDI keyboards are typically designed
for 12-tone equal temperament. This makes performing micro-
tonal music or inputting it into DAW using standard hardware
awkward and unintuitive. Hardware controllers designed specifi-
cally for microtones could significantly simplify microtonal music
production. Furthermore, while software can generate any sound,
the physical interaction with an instrument often sparks novel
musical ideas, highlighting the need for hardware that mirrors
software’s adaptability.
Extended Reality (XR)—encompassing Virtual Reality (VR),
Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR)—offers a promis-
ing avenue to bridge this hardware-software divide. Research
in Virtual Reality Musical Instruments (VRMI) explores repli-
cating rare or physically impractical instruments and enabling
novel performance modes [20]. XR allows virtual instruments to
be customized in shape and size, mirroring software flexibility
within an augmented physical environment. Recent work under
the umbrella of Extended Reality Musical Instruments (XRMI) in-
vestigates new musical possibilities grounded in physical reality.
We propose an XR musical keyboard that leverages XR’s
strengths to combine software flexibility (customizable key num-
bers and pitches) with tangible interaction (overlaying the virtual
keyboard onto a physical surface, such as a PC keyboard). This
system aims to provide an accessible platform for exploring di-
verse musical scales, including microtones, by adapting to the
user’s skill level and preferences and overcoming the limitations
of traditional hardware.

2 Related Work
Several technological approaches have addressed aspects of mi-
crotonal music creation and flexible instrument control.
Microtonal Software and Hardware: Software tools facilitate
the exploration of microtonality. Hirai developed an interface for
designing custom scales and piano rolls [11]. Tools like Leimma1
and Scala [15] support alternative tuning systems, contributing
to a growing interest in de-Westernized musical practices. How-
ever, these often rely on standard MIDI controllers, creating a
mismatch between software potential and hardware input. While
some traditional instruments (e.g., violins, trombones) inherently
support microtones, research has also focused on creating dedi-
cated microtonal hardware. Examples include Bailey et al. ’s mi-
crotonal clarinet [1] and Dabin et al. ’s 3D-printed microtonal flute
[3]. Digital fabrication enables customizable instrument designs
[21, 22], but building physical instruments remains complex and
costly. Crucially, physical instruments typically cannot change
their tuning easily after construction.
Flexible Controllers and VR/AR/MR Instruments: Alternative
hardware controllers like ROLI’s Seaboard2 (continuous key sur-
face) and Joué Play3 (modular pads) offer increased flexibility but
are still bound by their physical form factors. VR offers purely
virtual environments for music creation, like KORG Gadget VR4,
which allows users to build virtual studios. However, the lack of
tangible interaction can hinder performance feel.
VRMI aim to bridge this gap [20]. Researchers have recreated
rare instruments virtually [8] and developed VR pianos with hap-
tic feedback, like AirPiano [12]. Others have explored alternative
keyboard layouts optimized for VR [2]. A key challenge in VR
is hand tracking and representation; virtual hands often lack
the fidelity needed for precise instrument playing. Some designs
circumvent this by creating VRMIs independent of traditional
instrument forms [10].
AR and MR offer alternatives by overlaying virtual elements
onto the real world, allowing users to see and use their actual
hands. Santini’s Augmented Piano [ 18] overlays visuals onto
a real piano, enhancing it with new sounds and effects while
retaining natural hand interaction, potentially offering easier
performance than pure VRMI. Desnoyers-Stewart et al. created
an MR MIDI keyboard [4, 5], though MR hardware dependency
can limit accessibility.
Our work builds upon these areas by using pass-through XR
to create a tangible, yet fully customizable keyboard interface,
focusing on the potential for arbitrary key layouts and microtonal
exploration.
3 The XR Musical Keyboard System
We developed an XR musical keyboard system where a software-
defined virtual instrument is overlaid onto a tangible surface
using a pass-through Head-Mounted Display (HMD). For this
implementation, we used a standard PC keyboard as the tangible
surface, but any object providing distinct press locations could po-
tentially be used. The core idea is to align the 3D virtual keyboard
with the physical object (e.g., PC keyboard). This allows users
to see their own hands interacting with the virtual keys while
receiving tactile feedback from pressing the underlying physical
keys. Users see virtual keys, press them with their actual hands,

and hear the assigned sounds, mimicking the interaction with a
physical keyboard. This approach merges the flexibility of soft-
ware instrument design (custom key counts and pitches) with
a tangible playing experience, offering an accessible platform
particularly suited for exploring microtonal music.
3.1 System Overview
Figure 1 illustrates the user experience. In our setup, the physical
PC keyboard is covered with green cloth. This enables chroma-
key compositing via the HMD’s pass-through cameras: the green
area is replaced by the virtual keyboard, while the rest of the real-
world desk and the user’s hands remain visible. When playing, the
user’s hands naturally occlude parts of the green cloth, creating
a visually integrated experience where hands appear to directly
interact with the virtual keys (Fig. 1). A tracker (e.g., Vive Tracker)
placed near the covered keyboard allows the system to precisely
align the virtual instrument model with the physical keyboard
in the XR space.
The virtual instrument itself is a keyboard whose key count,
arrangement, and pitch assignments are customizable. Figure 1
shows examples: a simplified 6-key layout (perhaps one octave
using 5 keys plus the octave repeat) and a more complex 15-key
layout (potentially representing a 14-tone equal temperament oc-
tave). This flexibility allows tailoring the keyboard for simplicity
or enhanced expressiveness.
The hardware components are shown in Figure 2. We used a
Varjo XR-3 video pass-through HMD, known for its high resolu-
tion and wide field of view, running on a high-specification PC
(Intel i9-10900KF, 32GB RAM, Nvidia RTX3080). The prototype
was developed in Unity (v2021.3.3f1).
While optical pass-through HMDs exist, current models often
have limitations like a narrower field of view, which can hinder
the sense of immersion. Video pass-through was chosen for this
implementation, though future HMD advancements may allow
realization on various platforms.
In addition to the HMD and PC, the system uses a Vive Tracker
3.0 for positioning the virtual keyboard relative to the physical
one, and two SteamVR Base Stations 2.0 for tracking the HMD
and tracker. A standard PC keyboard covered with green cloth
serves as the tangible interaction surface. A mouse can optionally
be used for control functions during performance.
The PC keyboard, covered by the green cloth (Figure 3), re-
mains functional; its keys can still be pressed through the cloth.

keying, remaining pressable.
Figure 4: Temperament design interface (adapted from
Hirai, 2022 [11]) used for changing the number and pitch
of keys.
While green is commonly used for chroma-keying, any distinct
color that can be cleanly keyed out could work. Covering with
cloth was chosen for simplicity and compositing quality in this
prototype, but other readily available items could potentially
substitute.
3.2 Customizing Keys and Pitches
The number of virtual keys per octave and their specific pitches
are configured using an interface based on Hirai’s scale design
tool [11] (Figure 4). This interface allows users to add or remove
keys within an octave and adjust the pitch of each key finely (in
cents), starting from standard templates or creating scales from
scratch.
Once a scale is designed, the system exports the key count and
frequency data as a text "tuning file". By default, it saves pitch
information for one octave plus the first note of the next octave
(e.g., 13 notes for 12-tone equal temperament, C4 to C5).
These tuning files can be loaded dynamically during an XR
session. While wearing the HMD, the user can use the mouse to se-
lect and load a different tuning file, instantly changing the virtual
keyboard’s layout and pitches. This enables unique performance
possibilities, like switching between different temperaments (e.g.,
12-EDO and 17-EDO) mid-piece, analogous to modulation but
changing the entire scale structure. Similar to standard MIDI
controllers, the system also includes octave shift functionality
(implemented via mouse clicks in the current prototype).
A practical limitation is that if the number of virtual keys
becomes very large, individual virtual keys may become smaller
than the underlying physical keys. This can lead to misalign-
ment issues that require careful consideration of the maximum
practical key density for a given physical base.

4 Pilot Study and Preliminary Feedback
To gather initial user feedback on the proposed system, we con-
ducted a small pilot study focused particularly on the ease of
performance with customizable key layouts. Given the limited
sample size (N=4), this study should be considered as a prelimi-
nary investigation rather than a definitive evaluation.
4.1 Method
The study focused on comparing the ease of playing simple
melodies using two different XR musical keyboard layouts over-
laid on a PC keyboard:
• Simplified Layout (Experimental): 6 keys per octave (cor-
responding to C, D, E, F, G, A white keys).
• Standard Layout (Control): 12 keys per octave (standard
piano layout with white and black keys, Fig. 5).
Four participants (male and female, aged in their twenties, mostly
novices with keyboards - see Table 1) took part. We prepared
four short, well-known melodies playable using only the first
six notes (C to A). Participants played each melody on both the
6-key and 12-key interfaces. They first listened to the melody,
then attempted to play it using simplified numbered sheet music
(Fig. 6) corresponding to numbers displayed above the virtual
keys (Fig. 7). The order of the interfaces was alternated between
melodies to mitigate learning effects.
After playing each melody on both interfaces, the participants
answered brief questions that compared the ease of playing. After
all trials, they provided overall qualitative feedback. The session
took approximately 10 minutes per participant.

score compatibility.
4.2 Interfaces Compared
Both the 6-key (simplified) and 12-key (standard) interfaces were
presented within the same XR system, overlaid on the PC key-
board. The only difference was the virtual keyboard layout dis-
played and the mapping of physical keys to notes. The melodies
used only the notes available in both layouts (effectively, the
white keys C-A). During the evaluation, numbers correspond-
ing to the musical score (which could be toggled on/off) were
displayed above the virtual keys as shown in Fig. 7.
4.3 Musical Material and Notation
Four simple, well-known melodies were used:
(1) Mary Had a Little Lamb (first 8 measures)
(2) Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star (first 12 measures)
(3) Jingle Bells (16 measures)
(4) London Bridge is Falling Down (first 8 measures)
To accommodate participants with varying music reading abil-
ities, melodies were presented using numbers (Fig. 6) correspond-
ing to numbers displayed above each virtual key (Fig. 7). Numbers
floated above the keys. For the 12-key interface, numbers were
assigned sequentially to white keys, with decimal numbers for
the unused black keys to maintain spatial correspondence.
The numbered sheet music was provided both on paper (placed
near the keyboard) and on a monitor; participants could choose
their preferred reference. Participants played by matching the
numbers on the score to the numbers on the virtual keys. They
were allowed to restart if they made a mistake, continuing to the
next trial once a piece was played through.
4.4 Questionnaire Items
After each melody trial (playing on both 6-key and 12-key inter-
faces), participants answered:
(1) Familiarity with the melody (Yes/No).
(2) Perceived melody complexity (5-point scale: 1=Easy to 5=Dif-
ficult).
(3) Comparative ease of playing (5-point scale: 1=12-key much
easier, 3=Equal, 5=6-key much easier).
(4) Overall impressions/comments (Free-form, after all trials).
5 Pilot Study Results and Observations
This section presents the results from the small pilot study (N=4).
Table 2 shows the average scores for the questionnaire items
after each melody. A score closer to 1 on "Ease of Play" indicates
the 12-key interface was perceived as easier, while a score closer
to 5 indicates the 6-key interface was easier.
Table 2: Pilot Study Results (Average Scores, N=4)

no. this melody? complex? easier to play?
1 Yes, n=4 1.25 2.75
2 Yes, n=4 1.75 4.00
3 Yes, n=4 1.75 3.50
4 Yes, n=4 1.75 4.50
Ave Yes, n=4 1.63 3.69
All participants were familiar with all melodies. The melodies
were generally perceived as simple (average complexity score
1.63). Regarding ease of play, the overall average score was 3.69,
suggesting a slight trend favoring the 6-key interface among this
small group. However, preference varied by song (e.g., Song 1
average was 2.75, favoring the 12-key) and individual participant
responses also showed variability (not shown in the averaged
table).
Qualitative feedback collected after all trials included com-
ments such as:
• Some found the black keys on the 12-key layout helpful for
orientation, making the 6-key layout feel harder for certain
songs.
• Conversely, some found the 12-key layout slightly harder to
play due to narrower key spacing caused by the black keys.
• The 6-key layout was described as easy to recognize and press
by some.
• The wider spacing of the 6-key layout felt different from a
traditional piano.
• Both layouts were generally found to be intuitive.
• A perceived slight misalignment between the virtual keys and
the physical PC keys was mentioned.
• The tactile feedback from the PC keyboard felt different/strange
compared to a real piano.
• One participant commented on the potential for beginners to
learn piano with this system.
Overall, initial feedback was cautiously positive, but highlighted
potential areas for improvement, particularly the virtual-physical
key alignment.
Pilot Study Interpretation: This preliminary study with only
four participants suggests that interface preference (simplified
6-key vs. standard 12-key) might depend on the specific task
(melody) and individual user factors (e.g., familiarity with piano
layout). This hints that user customization of the keyboard layout
could be beneficial. Even for novices, familiarity with the standard
piano layout might provide orientation cues (black keys), while
fewer keys might offer cognitive simplicity for others.
The 6-key layout used was only marginally different from the
white keys of the 12-key layout within the tested note range
(C-A). Future studies should explore more distinct key layouts
(e.g., significantly fewer keys, or microtonal layouts with more
keys) to better understand the impact of customization.
This pilot study focused solely on ease of playing simple
melodies for novices, comparing only different key configura-
tions. It did not evaluate the system’s potential for enhanced
expressiveness (e.g., with microtonal scales) or other usability
aspects. More comprehensive evaluations with larger, diverse

participant groups are needed. For future work, we plan to con-
duct more comprehensive evaluations focusing on expressive
capabilities and microtonal performance, incorporating objective
performance metrics such as error rates and timing accuracy.
6 Discussion: Potential Applications
Beyond the preliminary findings, the proposed XR keyboard
concept opens up several potential application areas.
Space-Efficient Large Keyboards: While standard pianos have
88 keys, common MIDI controllers are smaller (e.g., 25, 49 keys)
partly due to desk space constraints. Our system could poten-
tially map a full 88-key layout (or even larger custom layouts)
onto a compact physical surface like one or more PC keyboards
(conceptualized in Fig. 8), arranged creatively (e.g., multi-row).
While precise mapping requires further development (see Sec. 7),
the concept allows large virtual instruments in limited physical
spaces.
Mixed Reality Ensembles: Although the virtual keyboard re-
quires an HMD, the sound produced can be heard by anyone
nearby. This facilitates ensemble playing between an XR key-
boardist and musicians playing traditional physical instruments
(conceptualized in Fig. 9). Furthermore, XR platforms are well-
suited for remote collaboration. Integrating our system with
remote session technologies [19] could enable mixed ensembles
involving local physical musicians, local XR musicians, and re-
mote collaborators (virtual or real). While this paper focuses on
the keyboard, the underlying principles could potentially extend

derlying physical key.
to other virtual instrument forms within such collaborative XR
environments.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
We introduced an XR music keyboard concept that overlays a
customizable virtual keyboard (arbitrary key count and pitches)
onto a tangible surface (e.g., a PC keyboard) using pass-through
XR. This approach aims to combine the flexibility of software
instruments with the tactile feedback of physical interaction. A
small pilot study (N=4) with novice users provided preliminary
feedback, suggesting a slight preference for a simplified 6-key
layout over a standard 12-key layout for playing simple melodies,
although results varied and highlighted the potential value of
user customization. The pilot study focused narrowly on ease of
play; further research is needed to evaluate expressiveness (espe-
cially with microtonal scales), usability, and overall performance
capabilities.
A key limitation identified in the current prototype is the po-
tential misalignment between virtual keys and the underlying
physical keys, especially at key boundaries or with high key den-
sities (as illustrated in Fig. 10). Pressing near a virtual boundary
might trigger an adjacent physical key, leading to unintended
notes.
Future work will focus on addressing this alignment challenge.
While hand-tracking integrated into HMDs could potentially
determine intended key presses more accurately, current tech-
nology often lacks the precision and speed required for complex
musical performance [6, 7]. Alternative solutions include using
input surfaces with higher spatial resolution (e.g., capacitive
touchpads, pressure-sensitive surfaces) instead of discrete PC
keys, or potentially combining the PC keyboard with improved
hand-tracking algorithms to infer intent based on finger position
relative to virtual key boundaries.
Our current version of the XR musical keyboard focuses solely
on key configurations. The integration of hand tracking and
other XR-specific interactions, such as voice and gesture input,
is expected to enable richer musical expression beyond simple
key-to-note mapping. Future work will explore these possibili-
ties, including Theremin-inspired gesture controls that enable
expressive features such as portamento and pitch-shift effects,
along with voice-based timbre control. While the current inter-
face provides only basic functionality, it demonstrates significant
potential for expansion. We will further explore the possibility of
enabling expressions that simply cannot be played without XR
technology.
Beyond the keyboard interface, the application of customiz-
able XR overlays could be explored for other instrument types
(e.g., virtual strings, winds, percussion) and novel VRMI designs

[14]. In addition to expressive potential, customizable keyboard
dimensions (size and inter-key spacing) could benefit educational
applications, particularly in piano pedagogy. This represents a
compelling research direction worthy of further investigation.
Integrating our system with existing research in XR for music ed-
ucation [9, 13, 16, 17, 23] and remote collaboration [19] presents
exciting possibilities for expanding musical practice and perfor-
mance through XR platforms.
