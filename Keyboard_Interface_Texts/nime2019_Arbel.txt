ABSTRACT
The Symbaline is an active instrument comprised of several
partly-ﬁlled wine glasses excited by electromagnetic coils.
This work describes an electromechanical system for incor-
porating frequency and amplitude modulation into the Sym-
baline’s sound. A pendulum having a magnetic bob is sus-
pended inside the liquid in the wine glass. The pendulum is
put into oscillation by driving infra-sound signals through
the coil. The pendulum’s movement causes the liquid in
the glass to slosh back and forth. Simultaneously, wine glass
sounds are produced by driving audio-range signals through
the coil, inducing vibrations in a small magnet attached to
the glass’s surface and exciting glass vibrations. As the
glass vibrates, the sloshing liquid periodically changes the
glass’s resonance frequencies and dampens the glass, thus
modulating both wine glass pitch and sound intensity.

1. INTRODUCTION
Modulation eﬀects are frequently used in both instrumen-
tal and vocal music. Modulation can aﬀect a tone’s pitch,
amplitude, or both. Modulation production vary per instru-
ment. In some instruments modulation eﬀects may require
external accessories or speciﬁc implementations such as an
electric guitar’s tremolo bar (Whammy bar) or involve large
mechanical movements, such as Leslie speakers. While the
terms vibrato and tremolo are used do describe diﬀerent
modulation types [20], the precise deﬁnitions may vary be-
tween disciplines. Therefore, this paper uses the explicit
terms frequency modulation and amplitude modulation.
The Symbaline is an active wine glass instrument con-
sisting of a set of partly-ﬁlled wine glasses actuated by an
electromagnet. The Symbaline is played using an auxiliary

musical instrument as an interface [2]. An overview of the
Symbaline is given in Section 2.1. This paper presents the
development of a modulation mechanism for the Symbaline
based on existing studies of liquid sloshing in cylindrical
cups, as discussed in Section 3. Figure 1 shows a block
diagram of the mechanism. The mechanism consists of a
pendulum with a magnetic bob submerged inside the wa-
ter in a partly-ﬁlled wine glass. A low frequency signal
(∼ 3Hz) is sent to the Symbaline’s electromagnetic coil,
placed in front of the pendulum, outside the glass. The in-
duced magnetic ﬁeld causes the pendulum to oscillate. The
pendulum’s movement creates a sloshing movement in the
liquid. An audio-range signal in the glass’s pitch is sent
to the same coil, causing the wine glass itself to produce
sounds via a small magnet attached to the glass’s surface.
The sloshing liquid both changes the glass resonance fre-
quencies and dampens the glass vibrations, thus creating a
modulation eﬀect of both pitch and amplitude. Figure 2
shows the mechanism in mid-slosh position.
Sections 2-4 provide an overview of related works, modu-
lation methods in musical instruments and liquid sloshing.
The modulation mechanism is described in Section 5. Sec-
tion 6 describes a characterization experiment of the mod-
ulation mechanism, where the glass was excited by input
signals of diﬀerent musical instruments, while being mod-
ulated by the mechanism. The complementary results are
shown in Section 7.

the low frequency ﬁeld puts the pendulum into oscillations,
causing water sloshing. Wine glass sounds modulated by
sloshing are captured by the microphone.

2. RELATED WORK
2.1 The Symbaline
The Symbaline, shown in Figure 3, [2] is an active instru-
ment consisting of a set of partly-ﬁlled wine glasses. Each
wine glass is actuated by an electromagnet, exciting a small
magnet attached to the glass’s surface. The electromag-
netic actuation method is inspired by earlier augmented in-
struments such as the Magnetic Resonator Piano [10], the
Electromagnetically Sustained Rhodes Piano [21] and the
EMvibe [4]. These instruments use electromagnets to ex-
cite and augment sounds produced by strings, tines and
bars.
The Symbaline is played by using an auxiliary musical
instrument as an interface. This instrument, such as a clas-
sical guitar or a MIDI keyboard, produces an analog sig-
nal. The signal is sampled by an audio interface and pro-
cessed with various audio eﬀects and ﬁlters on a PC. The
processed signal is then converted back to an analog sig-
nal, split, ampliﬁed, and sent to the electromagnets. The
electromagnets generate magnetic ﬁelds which vibrate the
magnets attached to the glasses, thus producing wine glass
sounds.
The Symbaline’s sound is created by two distinct sources:
1) The wine glasses’ radiated sounds; 2) The input instru-
ment’s original sound, radiated by the input instrument
itself or by an additional speaker. The glass sounds are
characterized by the input signal’s properties: decay and
attack times, volume envelope and spectral content can all
be modiﬁed to an extent by using diﬀerent input signals,
instruments and eﬀects. The Symbaline is based on earlier
prototypes which implement wine glass-string coupling by
strictly mechanical means [1].
The previous Symbaline’s implementation enables mod-
ulation by input signal processing. However, this imple-
mentation is limited in eﬀect as input signals outside the
glasses’ resonance frequencies tend to produce dim and quiet

sounds. In addition, modulation sometimes occurs due to
arbitrarily occurring warble - an amplitude modulation ef-
fect caused by mild glass asymmetry. The asymmetry causes
a frequency diﬀerence between the components of a mode
doublet [19], adding a beating eﬀect to the glass tone. Both
modulation methods are limited in capabilities, raising the
need for the modulation mechanism described in this work.
2.2 Musical Modulation Mechanisms
Modulation methods and mechanisms vary per instrument.
In string instruments, the vibrating string’s length is peri-
odically changed by a rocking motion of the string-stopping
ﬁnger. In wind instruments and singing, modulation is pro-
duced by periodically changing the air ﬂow, the mouth piece
pressure or similar techniques [11].
Some electric guitars are equipped with a dedicated mod-
ulation mechanism; a non-ﬁxed bridge is rocked back and
forth using a controlling lever to alter the vibrating string’s
length and tension [13]. The Floyd Rose bridge is a speciﬁc
modulation mechanism for the electric guitar, capable of
generating extreme pitch modulations [17]. A Leslie speaker
is a device, originally intended to be used with the Ham-
mond organ, in which the sound produced by a loudspeaker
is directed through a rotating wooden drum or horn. The
sound source’s periodical movement away and towards the
listener produces both amplitude and frequency modula-
tion [14]. Similar principles of sound modulation by sound
source rotations are found in the Corrugaphone ( Whirley
tube) [12] and the Bullroarer [16]. The vibraphone is a per-
cussion instrument resembling a marimba with tubular res-
onators. The vibraphone is equipped with a unique mech-
anism: electrically rotating discs are placed at the top of
the resonators, changing the bar-resonator coupling, thus
creating amplitude modulation [5].
A simple method exists for wine glass modulation: the
tilt modulation method. A partly ﬁlled wine glass is ﬁxed in
a tilted position, letting water extend to the lowered side.
The glass is played by rubbing the rim in circular motions.
As the nodes and anti-nodes revolve around the glass, the
contribution of the ’higher’ water level at one side of the
glass ﬂuctuates, resulting in frequency modulation [15]. As
the Symbaline’s wine glass excitation points are ﬁxed, this
method is inapplicable.

2.3 Liquids in Musical Instruments
Musical instruments utilize the ﬂowing and wobbling prop-
erties of liquids in various manners. The waterphone con-
sists of an enclosed steel bowl with protruding rods. Water
wobbling inside the bowl create a mostly arbitrary change
of resonance frequencies, modulating the sounds produced
by the bowed rods or struck bowl [22]. The hydraulophones
are a family of instrument, all consisting of water jets spout-
ing out of a series of holes in a large pipe. The player
blocks the holes, redirecting the jets towards sound produc-
ing mechanisms such as perforated disks or shafts [7]. The
ancient Chinese instrument Yu xi ( Spouting bowl or Reso-
nance bowl) consists of a large metal bowl ﬁlled with water.
When friction is properly applied to the handles, the bowl
produces sounds accompanied by visible water spouts [18].
The Mocean is an installation in which water movements in
a tank control organ pipe’s sound production by image pro-
cessing. The variable water pressure and movements create
varied frequency and amplitude envelopes [8]. The Water-
Touch is a water based interface capturing acoustic waves
at frequencies outside the human hearing range formed in
a water tank. The frequencies are shifted and acoustically
radiated, producing audible sounds and music [6].
3. SLOSHING IN A CYLINDRICAL CUP
Sloshing is the movement of liquids inside containers such
as tanks, pools and drinking glasses. While sloshing is of-
ten studied in the context of large-scale containers such as
fuel tanks, Mayer and Krechetnikov [9] suggest an analytic
model for the sloshing frequencies in cylindrical coﬀee cups:
ω2mn = gϵmn
R tanh
(
ϵmn
H
R
)
(1)
where H is the liquid’s height, R is the cup’s radius and g
is the gravity acceleration. Here ϵmn is the nth root of the
ﬁrst derivative of the m th-order Bessel function of the ﬁrst
kind. For a typical cup, R = 3 .5cm and H = 10 cm, the
lowest sloshing frequency is 3 .65Hz.
As wine glasses diﬀer from cylindrical cups by having
curved bottom and walls, they are expected to demonstrate
slightly diﬀerent sloshing frequencies. Section 6.1 describes
an experiment measuring wine glass sloshing frequencies.
4. WINE GLASS TONE MODULATION
Adding liquid to a wine glass has two distinct eﬀects on the
tone. First, the glass’s resonance frequency is lowered due
to the increased vibrating mass. Second, the liquid dampens
the glass, decreasing the sound intensity. As the most dom-
inant wine glass normal modes are characterized by larger
displacement amplitudes near the top, both eﬀects are more
pronounced with higher initial liquid levels. Sloshing liq-
uids in a wine glass can therefore be used to modulate the
tone’s pitch and intensity in a periodic fashion. The lowest
resonant sloshing frequency involves the largest liquid dis-
placement amplitudes. Therefore, it is the frequency used
for sound modulation by the mechanism described here.
Figure 4 shows liquid sloshing in a wine glass with a pe-
riod T at diﬀerent time points. The glass’s electromagnetic
excitation point is shown to the left. At t= 0 (Figure 4a),
a large liquid mass is raised near the excitation point. The
raised liquid mass joins the glass’s vibration, resulting in a
lowered pitch and decreased sound intensity relative to the
rest position. At t= T/4 (Figure 4b) the liquid is lowered to
a horizontal position. As the glass’s vibrations are smaller
at the bottom, the liquid vibrations decrease, resulting in a
raised pitch and increased sound intensity relative to t= 0.
Time point t = T/2 (Figure 4c) is similar to point t = 0,
(a) t= 0.
 (b) t= T/4.
 (c) t= T/2.
Figure 4: Stages of sloshing. (a) The water is raised on
the left side, near the excitation point, contributing to both
pitch and sound intensity decrease. (b) The water is hor-
izontal. In this stage both pitch and sound intensity are
maximal. (c) The water is raised on the right side away
from the excitation point. Much like at t = 0, both pitch
and sound intensity decrease, resulting in a modulation pe-
riod of T/2.
as the vibrating liquid mass is equally increased, causing
lowered pitch and damping. Since time points t = 0 and
t= T/2 are acoustically similar, sloshing at frequency f is
expected to generate frequency and amplitude modulations
at 2f. Additional modulation components may be found in
other frequencies, as described in Section 7.
5. LIQUID MODULATION MECHANISM
5.1 Pendulum
The modulation mechanism consists of a pendulum having
a magnetic bob submerged inside the water in a partly-ﬁlled
wine glass. The water has a resonant sloshing frequency of
∼3Hz. The pendulum is activated by an electromagnet
placed outside the glass. A low frequency pure tone signal
at ∼ 3Hz is sent to the electromagnet. The pendulum
responds in oscillations at the same frequency, generating a
corresponding high amplitude liquid sloshing.
The pendulum, 60 mm long, is made of 3D printed PLA
plastic. A piece of sheet metal with a larger surface area acts
like the blade of an oar: it is attached at the bottom of the
pendulum, and is responsible for moving the liquid. A weak
magnetic ﬁeld, generated by the permanent magnets in the
conﬁguration, is present inside the glass. The pendulum’s
initial position in the glass is therefore near equilibrium.
Figure 5 shows the pendulum suspended from its mounting
rig with the magnetic bob and blade.
5.2 Signal Generation
The Symbaline’s electromagnetic coils were previously de-
veloped for the sole purpose of wine glass sound excitation.
Our novel modulation mechanism uses the original coils
for simplicity. Each coil consists of 250 turns of 28AWG
(0.3mm diameter) magnetic wire around a ferrite core. A
Neodymium magnet is attached at the back of the coil to
increase the magnetic ﬂux. The coil is driven by ampliﬁed
3 −3.5Hz pure tones generated by a PC.
A standard audio ampliﬁer circuit based on a LM1876
(20 Watt) integrated circuit was used for driving the coil.
Signals for both pendulum and wine glass sound excitation
were ampliﬁed. Like many audio ampliﬁers, the circuit in-
corporates a high-pass ﬁlter at the input stage, to block DC
from previous stages and to attenuate infra-sound signals.
This standard circuit is incompatible with our needs, as the
pendulum is excited by infra-sound frequencies. Therefore,
the ampliﬁer was modiﬁed and its cutoﬀ frequency was de-
creased to below ∼2Hz.

6. EXPERIMENT
6.1 Wine Glass Sloshing Resonance
A preliminary experiment was conducted to measure the
sloshing resonance frequency of water ﬁlled wine glasses.
The modulation mechanism was submerged inside a partly-
ﬁlled wine glass. A frequency sweep of the excitation sig-
nal was performed over 1 −8Hz, capturing the sloshing
on video. The water’s sloshing resonance frequency was
detected at 3 .2Hz by video analysis. Casual observations
of diﬀerent glasses with varying water levels show similar
sloshing resonant frequencies. Furthermore, pendulums of
diﬀerent lengths were used, showing a discernible eﬀect of
the pendulum’s length on sloshing.
6.2 Modulation Mechanism Characterization
The experiment’s block diagram is shown in Figure 1. A
wine glass was fastened to a base, ﬁlled with water and
ﬁtted with a surface magnet. An electromagnetic coil was
placed in front of the surface magnet. A pendulum, hanging
from an external support, was submerged in the water. Two
signals were sent to the coil simultaneously: 1) A signal
at the sloshing resonant frequency, fpend, used to put the
pendulum into oscillation; 2) An audio-range signal, used to
excite wine glass acoustic sounds. A microphone recorded
the resulting wine glass sound which contained modulation
caused by the sloshing.
The experiment was performed on two glasses: Glass A
was tuned with water to B4 ( ∼494Hz) with 3 .2Hz slosh-
ing frequency and Glass B was tuned with water to G4
(∼392Hz) with 3.05Hz sloshing frequency. Each glass was
excited by six audio-range signals. Each signal contained a
recording of a single tone in the glass’s pitch, produced by
a diﬀerent musical instrument: classical guitar, electric gui-
tar, cello, piano, recorder and ﬂute. Reference recordings
were obtained by exciting the glasses with the same input
signals, but without activating the pendulum. The supple-
mental ﬁle Modulation sample.wav contains a recording of
a wine glass excited by a classical guitar and a ﬂute with-
out modulation, followed by a recording with modulation
for the same inputs.
7. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
Let ffund(t) be the fundamental frequency of a non modu-
lated wine glass sound, generated by exciting the glass in
audio frequency, without activating the pendulum. In a typ-
ical musical tone, ffund(t) has some mild temporal changes
over time t.
Let G[t·ffund(t)] be the fundamental frequency compo-
nent of the non-modulated wine glass sound, which is a
carrier wave having an attack-decay amplitude envelope.
Let us introduce frequency modulation to G[t·ffund(t)] by
adding strong temporal changes to ffund(t), so it becomes
fFM(t). The fundamental frequency component of the fre-
quency modulated wine glass sound is now given by:
GFM(t) = G[t·fFM(t)]. (2)
Similarly, let us independently introduce amplitude mod-
ulation to G[t·ffund(t)] using a modulation amplitude enve-
lope aAM(t). The fundamental frequency component of the
amplitude modulated wine glass sound is now given by:
GAM(t) = aAM(t)G[t·ffund(t)]. (3)
Praat (a software for speech and phonetics analysis) [3]
and Matlab were used to extract fFM(t) and aAM(t) from
each of the recordings obtained in the experiment. The
extracted values were then examined in both the time and
frequency domains.
7.1 Frequency Modulation
Figure 6a plots the frequency temporal changes, fFM(t),
of a glass sound generated by a classical guitar input tone
with pendulum modulation. Figure 6b plots FFT[ fFM(t)].
The temporal changes are apparent in the form of a peak
at double the pendulum’s frequency: 2 fpend = 6Hz. The
ﬁgures also show ffund(t) and FFT[ffund(t)], obtained from
a glass sound excited by a classical guitar input tone with-
out pendulum modulation, i.e., G[t·ffund(t)]. The temporal
changes of ffund(t) are considerably lower. Figures 6c and
6d show analogous analysis for a wine glass sound gener-
ated by ﬂute input tone. Similar frequency modulations
at double the sloshing frequency were detected across most
recordings, with a typical magnitude of 60 cents peak-to-
peak (0.6 semitones).
7.2 Amplitude Modulation
Figure 7a plots the modulated envelope aAM(t) of a glass
sound generated by a classical guitar input tone with pendu-
lum modulation. Figure 7b plots FFT[ aAM(t)]. Amplitude
modulation is visible at double the pendulum’s frequency,
2fpend = 6Hz. The ﬁgures also show the amplitude enve-
lope of G[t·ffund(t)], a glass sound generated by a classi-
cal guitar input tone without pendulum modulation, and
the corresponding envelope’s FFT. Figures 7c and 7d show
analogous analysis for a wine glass sound generated by ﬂute
input tone.
Similar amplitude modulations at double the pendulum’s
frequency were detected in 11 out of 12 pendulum modu-
lated tones. At a single recording (Flute input, Glass A ,
Figures 7c and 7d) amplitude modulation was detected at
∼3Hz.

8. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
A mechanism for mechanically modulating active wine glass
sounds was presented, using automated water sloshing move-
ments generated by electromagnets. While various auto-
mated electromechanical modulation mechanisms exist, such
as the vibraphone’s rotating discs, we are unaware of such
mechanisms for wine glasses or similar instruments, nor of
automated water sloshing based mechanisms.
The mechanism demonstrated both frequency and ampli-
tude modulation on diﬀerent glasses, through various input
signals. For most input signals, the generated modulation
frequency is double the sloshing frequency. Frequency dou-
bling is caused by the approximate vertical symmetry of
the wine glass and sloshing movement, making the raised
liquid levels on both sides of the glass acoustically similar.
Throughout a single pendulum oscillation period, the liq-
uid raises twice, once per each side of the glass. Each time
the liquid raises, both frequency and amplitude decrease,
resulting in a doubled modulation frequency as discussed in
section 4.
The pendulum modulation’s frequency is limited: the
sloshing frequency is determined by the glass geometry and
water level, thus deﬁning a speciﬁc modulation frequency
per a given water-tuned glass. For the wine glasses and
water levels typically used in the Symbaline, the modula-
tion frequency was shown to be ∼6Hz. This is unlike the
tilt modulation method , where the modulation frequency is
determined by the hand movement’s velocity. Thus, the
modulation is limited only by the player’s dexterity. The
tilt modulation method is applicable to an ordinary glass
played by friction, but not to an active wine glass excited
electromagnetically, as explained in section 2.2.
The pendulum modulation is also limited to generating

precise periodic amplitude and frequency modulation. Ex-
panding the mechanism with additional modulation types,
such as the arbitrary modulation of the waterphone may be
considered.
The mechanism presented here was developed for char-
acterization purposes. The mechanism may be used as a
modulation accessory for the Symbaline, although further
development should be considered before incorporating it
as an integral part of the instrument. The mechanism’s
support may be more elegant if ﬁtted from inside the glass,
rather than from an external apparatus. The required elec-
tric power may prove to be excessive when driving several
mechanisms simultaneously, and require specialized power
supply units. Furthermore, the low frequency currents gen-
erate noticeable heat in the electromagnetic coils. Both
issues may be overcome by improving the mechanism’s de-
sign.
