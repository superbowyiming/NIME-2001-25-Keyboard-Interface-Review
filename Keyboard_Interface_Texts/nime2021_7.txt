ABSTRACT
Can random digit data be transformed and utilized as a sound installation that 
provides a referential connection between a book and the electromechanical 
computer? What happens when the text of A Million Random Digits with 100,000 
Normal Deviates is ‘vocalized’ by an electro-mechanical object? Using a media 
archaeological research approach, Click::RAND#2, an indeterminate sound sculpture 
utilising relays as sound objects, is an audio-visual reinterpretation and representation 
of an historical relationship between a book of random digits and the 
electromechanical relay. Developed by the first author, Click::RAND#2 is the physical 
re-presentation of random digit data sets as compositional elements to complement the 
physical presence of the work through spatialized sound patterns framed within the 
context of Henri Lefebvre’s rhythmanalysis and experienced as synchronous, 
syncopated or discordant rhythms.

Introduction
Expressing his scepticism of quantum theory, that nature is inherently probabilistic, 
Einstein stated, “God doesn’t play dice with the world.” [1] Someone did not tell our 
ancestors. Some believed an outcome determined by the use of randomizers, including 
the roll of the dice, the casting of coins, the drawing of straws or lots or other aleatoric 
methods, to be an expression of God’s will. [2] [3] Uncomfortable with the idea of 
randomness and the belief that things happen for a reason, early sentiments were that 
these events were God’s way to explain the unexpected. [1]
 Randomness, an inherent part of the world we live in, is a phenomenon we strive to 
understand and control. As such, a number of equivalent definitions have been 
proposed that contextualize randomness relative to prior notions. These include, but

are not limited to, definitions in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, physics and based 
on social phenomena. Sebastiaan Terwijn encapsulates the milieu of definitions in 
stating,
A random object is defined as an object that is random with respect to a given 
type of definition, or class of sets. As the class may vary, this yields a scale of 
notions of randomness, which may be adapted to the specific context in which the 
notion is to be applied. [4]
The objective of this paper is not to argue an exact definition for, or to provide a 
history of, randomness or methods of random sequence generation. Rather the 
objective is to apply Terwijn’s notions of randomness to the specific context of sound-
based art.
This paper presents an object-based sound installation that, through a material media 
archaeological approach, explores the possibility of “embodying the notation of 
presence and absence” as a method to expose the patterns of state transitions of 
binary sequences as a series of rhythmic forms. [5] Titled Click::RAND#2, the work is 
an electromechanical sound-sculpture that transforms RAND Corporations book of 
random numbers into an audiovisual series of compositional patterns. The project 
presented in this paper is a reconceptualization and redevelopment of the first 
author’s work presented at NIME 2020. [6] As such, Click::RAND#2 has evolved into a  
multi-dimensional and adaptable work that explores both the inherent rhythmic 
patterns in the data and the acoustic nuances of the space it inhabits.          
The next section presents a brief overview of the two main artefacts utilized in 
Click::RAND#2. The paper then introduces media archaeology as a way of engaging 
with the sound object that has been used in the ideation and creation of the work. 
After a brief repertoire review in the use of chance in the arts, the paper introduces 
Click::RAND#2 as an object-based sound installation. The paper ends with a discussion 
of the work and concluding remarks.
Overview of Media Artefacts
The ideation and creation of Click::RAND#2 has been informed by developments in, 
and a relationship between, the mechanical production and publication of large 
random number sets and electromechanical relay-based computers. This section 
briefly describes these artefacts.

Electromechanical Computing Takes Command.
Electromechanical calculating machines were developed in the mid-20th century to 
meet the growing need to perform more complex scientific and engineering 
calculations. These early machines consisted partly of reconfigurable systems of 
relays. The advantages of these new calculating machines were twofold. First was the 
ability to perform more complex calculations than merely addition and subtraction. 
Second was the ability to flexibly reconfigure a circuit according to what one wanted 
the circuit to do i.e. to perform arithmetic, control functions or number storage. [7] 
The development of an abstract notation (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, etc.1) to express the 
logical relationships of decimal numbers in binary format was developed to facilitate 
arithmetic and control functions for these early machines. [8] For the relays 
performing this arithmetic it was a matter of activating or deactivating the relay as a 
series of off (0) or on (1) sequences. However, these new machines were not without 
their problems. These included their performance which limited the complexity and 
quantity of computations that could be undertaken and the relays’ intermittent failure 
resulting in incorrect calculations that may have gone unnoticed. [7] [9] It is within 
these constraints that other non-computational methods of random number generation 
continued to be used to provide large data sets for use in calculations and modelling 
studies.
Large Random Number Sets in the Age of Mechanical Production
Even before the use of electromechanical and electronic devices to perform more 
complex scientific and engineering calculations, demand existed for large and high 
quality true random number sets. The construction and publication of large tables of 
random sampling numbers was driven by their need in probabilistic experiments 
where the one-time generation of sufficient numbers in each case was considered slow, 
laborious and not without bias.
A variety of applications for probabilistic modelling studies increased demand for 
larger, truly random number sets that would not be questioned as to whether they 
were good enough to be used or to overcome the reuse of data sets in a model. [10] 
Motivated by this need in its own experimental research, RAND Corporation 
constructed an electronic mechanism to generate random numbers and punch them 
onto cards. [9]  The work, completed in 1947, consisted of 20,000 punch cards with 50 
numbers on each. RAND Corporation published the work as a book in 1955. Named A 
Million Random Digits and 100,000 Normal Deviates, (see Figure 1) the volume 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Click::RAND#2. An Indeterminate Sound Sculpture

consisted of two large tables that contained 1,000,000 random digits and 100,000 
Gaussian deviates.
This book is the stimulus for the ideation of a indeterminate sound installation. The 
random number and normal deviation data sets are now publicly available from RAND 
Corporation’s website2. Could this data be transformed and utilized as an object-based 
sound installation that provides a referential connection between the book and the 
electromechanical computer? This question is the basis of this paper which concerns 
the use of randomness as an artistic construct.
C l i c k : : R A N D # 2  as  Creative Media Archaeology
Media archaeology, as an approach to the critique of contemporary media culture and 
history, is considered to formulate counter histories to the dominant narratives of 
technology and media.  One approach to undertaking media archaeology research 
excavates the agency of the machine, a shift from understanding media history 
through discourse alone, to consider it through the use and remediation of a material 
artefact. [11] Drawing on an operative media archaeology of a close reading and 
hearing of sound, Click::RAND#2’s aurality is based on a close listening to the sonic 
artifacts of a single relay. As such, the work explores the media archaeological 
relationship between two artefactual forms of media, electromechanical computers via

the relay and the RAND Corporation’s book of random digits to create an 
indeterminate sound installation.
Wolfgang Ernst argues that apparatus only reveal their essence through a process of 
technological execution; an operative engagement with an artefact that can reveal a 
sonic heritage. As a method for analysing the dynamic nature of media technologies, 
Ernst examines the relationships between rhythmics, sound and the wider sonic 
sphere. However, Ernst suggests an interlaced approach to the analysis and 
interpretation of these sonic worlds as a refrain from an immediate cultural 
contextualization without being reduced to mere physical acoustics. [12][13]
One  method of rhythmic analysis that incorporates subjects that do not produce any 
obvious sound in the listening experience is Henri Lefebvre’s rhythmanalysis. He 
states “everywhere where there is interaction between a place, a time and an 
expenditure of energy, there is rhythm.” [14] Lefebvre’s rhythmanalysis is comprised 
of a variety of rhythms that coexist and clash, categorized as eurhythmia, polyrhythmia 
and arrhythmia. Eurhythmia is considered to be the smooth combination of rhythms in 
equilibrium. Polyrhythmia is composed of diverse rhythms that, at times, interact to 
maintain a symbiosis but at times clash as relational forces of contradictions and 
resistance to maintain a harmonious relationship. Arrhythmia is the state of discordant 
rhythms, rhythms that break apart in a divergence of time and space. [15] However, 
Click::RAND#2’s expressive forms are not solely framed by Lefebvre’s concepts of the 
rhythmic patterns inherent in the “experience and knowledge of the body”. [14] Its 
transverse rhythms, as layers that may compete against or complement each other, 
weave complex forms among times, spaces, and energies that move between the 
human and non-human. At the modal intersection of Ernst’s machine time and a lived 
acoustic time, are differences that Lefebvre describes in musical terms as measure and 
beat (linear time) and melody and harmony ( cyclic time). In this sense, Lefebvre’s 
combination of linear and cyclic time, as a way of producing differences out of 
repetition, is used in Click::RAND#2  to discover new opportunities for creating 
rhythm. [16]
Related Works
Even before Marcel Duchamp used chance methods “as a way of going against logical 
reality” randomness, as a creative ideal, had a centuries long history in literature and 
the arts. [17] The use of stochastic methods of composing or performing music also 
has a long history. Some of the descriptions for these techniques include, but are not 
limited to, aleatoric, indeterminate or chance music. Precedents for the use of these

forms include John Cage’s use of indeterminacy across a range of works including 
Music of Changes (1951), a work based on his study of the I Ching. In pushing the limit 
of indeterminacy, Cage’s goal for the works was to abandon all sense of control by the 
composer or performer. For 4’33” the performance was left to the unpredictability of 
environmental sounds. Pierre Boulez’s experimentation with ‘controlled chance’ in 
works such as Troisième Sonate- Format III: Constellation-miroir (1957) and 
Improvisations sur Mallarme (1957) differed from the indeterminacy of Cage by only 
allowing a choice of possibilities for the performer. Described as a loading of the dice, 
Boulez’s saw that the unstructured, imprecise use of chance could “conceal a 
fundamental weakness in compositional technique” and instead, sort to use controlled 
chance and risk within a strict structure, with limited outcomes. [18][19] Randomness 
also played a role in the artistic practice of Iannis Xenakis, providing new ways of 
composing through the use of probability distributions and stochastic techniques. He 
saw the use of probability functions in music as a technique for creating and 
articulating sound inspired by natural events and saw it as an opportunity to 
incorporate scientific concepts into modern music. [20] Examples include Pithoprakta 
(1954) and GENDY3 (1991) along with his development of computer systems such as 
the ST Program (1962) to generate indeterminate compositions and multi-media works 
(for example, Polytope de Cluny, 1972). Such an approach to the use of randomness as 
generative algorithms plays a key role in contemporary electronic and experimental 
music.
The use of an indeterminate approach in electromechanical sound art allows an artist 
to explore the agency and action of materials and objects in their works. Jon Pigott 
describes this as a process-driven sensibility that exhibits unpredictable sounding, non-
linear and unpredictable material behaviours. He argues that, as a creative method, 
the use of the indeterminacy in electromechanical sound art adds to a sense that the 
artist has relinquished an element of control in the creative outcome. By letting the 
natural unfolding of events play a part in the creative process, “the work is free to 
voice the unexpected behaviours of the electromechanical.” [21] As such, the work is 
indeterminate with respect to its performance, differing from the use of chance 
operations as a form of “random procedure in the act of composition.” [22][23] 
Examples of the use of unpredictability in the resultant sound work include Stephen 
Cornford’s Migration (2014). This installation piece uses a number of obsolete 
dictaphones whose ensuant sound is left to the small rhythmic variations of each 
device’s mechanism. Darsha Hewitt’s Electrostatic Bell Choir (2012-2013) utilizes the 
static electricity emitted from discarded cathode ray tube television monitors tuned to

various channels of white noise. The static from the TVs agitates hanging pith balls 
that lightly strike sets of bells. A number of Sergey Filatov’s sound sculptures 
introduce elements of randomness generated through algorithmic processes. Examples 
include Long Wave: 150-400 (2018) and Random Tala (2017). Zimoun’s immersive 
sound installations include the use of everyday objects and materials along with 
mechanical elements such as d.c. motors. He describes his works as generating or 
evolving by elements of chance not “to discover unexpected results, but to elevate the 
works to a higher level of vitality.” [24]
The next section introduces and discusses Click::RAND#2, an indeterminate sound 
sculpture. As such, the work is indeterminate with respect to its performance. [25] 
Click::RAND#2 foregrounds the relay as the sound-producing object and uses the 
sonic by-products of a series of relays to create a sound installation as an audio-visual 
representation of distinctly different, but related, forms of media.

Click::RAND#2 reinterprets an historical relationship between a book of random digits 
and the electromechanical relay. These artefacts are used as the input and output 
media of the work. This re-presentation of Click::RAND (the earlier work) arises from 
the need to expand the physical presence and sonic affordances of the sound sculpture 
and equip its output with spatial expressivity. The representation of random digit data 
expressed in the earlier work by a row of relays was ambiguous and made limited use 
of what is a rich and extensive data set.
Click::RAND#2 uses the random digit data as an input source and the relay as a output 
sound object to explore the inherent rhythms that exist in the random digit sets re-
presented as binary sequences. As a set of self-contained ‘sound blocks’, 
Click::RAND#2 can be adapted to many physical spaces as a way of incorporating 
different acoustic properties into  the installation.. An illustration of one sound block is 
shown in Figure 2.

System Overview
Click::RAND#2 expands the presence of a single relay as an aesthetic element by 
utilizing 20 relays configured in a 4x5 grid on a single printed circuit board (PCB). This 
is shown in Figure 3. The physical structure of Click::RAND#2 is provided by the PCB. 
Each row of four relays is used to represent binary-coded decimal digits 0 to 9 (i.e., 
0000 to 1001). Converting the decimal character to its binary equivalent, the sound 
block represents each random digit in its respective row within a block of digits in the 
book’s text. An LED embedded in each relay provides a visual indication of a sound’s 
source. Two switches are used to select the board’s compositional mode.

All electronic componentry is contained on the single PCB. These components include 
the driver circuitry to actuate the relays, a Teensy 3.5 microcontroller and voltage 
regulation. A system overview is shown in Figure 4.

The Teensy microcontroller programmatically controls each relay through MOSFET 
driver circuitry. The Teensy hosts a software programme (sketch) developed as a part 
of the work. This sketch is used to control the work and the random digit and normal 
deviate text files. These files are contained on an onboard memory card. A digit is 
randomly selected from the digit file then translated into its binary equivalent which is 
split into its individual symbols (0s, 1s). These are sent as high or low pulses by the 
Teensy to the input gate of the associated MOSFET which, in turn, engages the relay. 
The physical structure of Click::RAND’s sound block is provided by the printed circuit 
board. All electronic components are mounted on the reverse side of the circuit board 
using surface mount components. The reverse side of the circuit board with 
componentry is shown in Figure 5.

Signal Chain
With reference to Figure 6 below, the random digit and normal deviates data files are 
opened for reading (1).  Usong this method, each file remains open for reading and 
memory use is minimised. The Teensy reads the status of the mode switches to 
determine the software function to run (2). Three modes are currently available. These 
modes are elaborated the Compositional Strategies section. Within the selected 
function, a digit is selected at random from the necessary file. Modes 00 and 10 use 
the digits file while mode 01 uses both the digits and deviates files with the deviate 
number used as a tempo element within the work (3a, 3b). The selected digit is 
converted from a decimal character to a binary string (4). This string is split into 
individual ‘bits’ and used to actuate the corresponding relays in a row (5).
Aesthetic Approach
Click::RAND#2 is based on the sonic artefacts of a single relay. By reducing the relay 
to a basic sounding object, its individual sonic materiality can be heard as a click when 
the relay’s contacts engage and disengage. The use of a single relay provides a limited 
sound palette and constrains the compositional outcome of deploying this palette. The 
single relay is extended to 20 relays on a single PCB to foreground the relays’ sonic 
nuances through repetition of their sound and to expand the visual and sonic elements 
of the work. The use of a white circuit board is an abstract reference to the page in A 
Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates. This is shown in Figure 7.

Compositional Strategies
This section describes Click::RAND#2’s various compositional forms as expressive 
rhythmic patterns. Following a brief introduction detailing how temporal and 
structural logic has been used as a form of meter for digit replay, Henri Lefebvre’s 
rhythmanalysis is introduced as a way to contextualize and describe the various 
compositional forms used in Click::RAND#2. This is followed by descriptions of each of 
Lefebvre’s rhythmic forms used as compositions.
Rhythmanalysis as Context and Concept
Lefebvre’s concept of rhythm is based on repetition, with a continual interference of 
cyclic and linear time. Each rhythm’s reprise or return, as difference, introduces 
something new and unforeseen. [14] Modelled on an abstract quantitative time, 
Click::RAND#2’s meter is the measure of time to transmit each binary coded decimal 
sequence. Noting Lefebvre’s measure as consisting of both quantitative aspects, that 
of marking time and moments, and qualitative aspects that link them together, 
Click::RAND#2 weaves together binary sequences as quantified moments. Drawing on 
Ernst’s media archaeological approach as a method of engagement with the 
materiality of the artefact and making audible the medium of print and Lefebvre’s

rhythmanalysis as an approach for each composition, three expressive forms of 
message replay are conceived. These three forms are characterized as eurhythmia 
(rhythms of equality), polyrhythmia (rhythms of diversity), and arrhythmia (rhythms of 
disturbance). Each of Click::RAND#2’s compositions are titled after these 
characterizations. Eurhythmia shows the smoother rhythmic but machine-like patterns 
of interwoven binary sequences across multiple rows of relays. Polyrhythmia 
introduces the element of space into the compositional form, both physically by the 
placement of sound blocks and into the work as the presence and absence of sound. 
Arrhythmia’s tempo disturbs the work’s spatio-temporal element through the presence 
and absence of sound as asynchronous binary sequences. Examples of these expressive 
forms are in the video documentation are available in the footnote.3
Eurhythmia
Eurhythmia, as a state of rhythmic resonance, is a state characterized by the 
synchronization of different rhythms into a cohesive whole. It involves a form of 
rhythmic coordination as a distinct way to express how the experience of space and 
time may interact. [14]
Stanley Blue, quoted in Lyon, argues that eurhythmia contains elements of arrhythmia 
in the form of irregular “pauses, breaks and off-beats.” [26] Eurhythmia is a 
composition for one sound block. The composition is a linear ‘reading’ of the book from 
the first to the last digit (1-1,000,000). Rather than read each digit individually, the 
book is read sequentially in rows of five. Therefore, each row of relays re-presents a 
binary coded decimal digit simultaneously. In this form, the binary sequences sway 
between moments of synchronized and syncopated rhythms that are briefly disrupted 
by moments of disturbance. These arrhythmic disturbances are the result of a 
eurhythmia signified by an absence of sound -eurhythmic as synchronized patterns of 
0s, arrhythmic as a perceived break in the rhythm. Heard as an irregular pause or off-
beat, the arrhythmic moment is the result of the synchronization of two consecutive 0s 
in the binary sequences occurring simultaneously across all five rows. An example of 
this pattern is show in Figure 8 with the arrhythmic pause highlighted. 
Compositionally, these minor ruptures are audiovisual representations of Lefebvre’s 
description of eurhythmia where the discordant rhythm clashes before coordinating 
once again. Eurhythmia’s concentration of sound and the sustained playing of binary 
sequences creates machine-like rhythms that evoke a connection to the rhythmic 
clattering of early electromechanical computers. The linearity of quantized time is 
evident in the regular tempo used in this compositional form. As a reading of the book, 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Click::RAND#2. An Indeterminate Sound Sculpture
15
Eurhythmia is a long form composition lasting approximately 46 hours. Once the digits 
are read, the work is silent.
Polyrhythmia
Michel Alhadeff-Jones considers Lefebvre’s polyrhythmia to be an environment where 
heterogeneous rhythms co-exist simultaneously without coordinating with each other. 
[27] In the absence of synchronization, one has to focus on each of them separately, 
and eventually successively, in order to grasp their specific rhythms.
Polyrhythmia is a composition for multiple sound blocks. This use allows varying 
spatial installations. Partly dependent on the installation location, the work’s physical 
layout can be installed as lines of sound blocks or as a grid. The number of boards can 
be varied with up to 16 sound blocks being used in a single installation. This may 
consist of single or multiple sound blocks installed on multiple walls or a varying 
number of sound blocks installed on a single wall. This compositional form makes use 
of both a location’s physical space and the presence and absence of sound inherent in 
the spatio-temporal nature of binary sequences. The patterns, listened to as spatially 
displaced rhythms, allow a listener’s focus to shift between two levels. At a macro-
level, the interweaving patterns represent the totality of the work. At a micro-level, the 
individual sounds and sequential moments of each binary pattern draws a listener’s 
attention to the individual sounds.

16
Polyrhythmia selects a random single digit and plays the binary encoded sequence on 
the grid row it is found in the book. A notated example of this compositional form is 
shown in Figure 9. Each stave represents a sound block with each line representing a 
line of relays.
 
Arrhythmia
Arrhythmia is characterized by the provisional or permanent lack of synchronization 
between rhythms. [27] It can, subjectively, be perceived as a lack of harmony 
expressed as a form of dissonance. Dawn Lyon notes that a rhythmanalyst is interested 
in this discordant form for “its potential to generate creative differences”. [26]
Like Polyrhythmia, Arrhythmia is a composition for multiple sound blocks. A random 
single digit is selected, binary encoded and played on the grid row found in the book. 
However, any great variations in the timing of a digital signal (as a binary coded 
decimal digit) will introduce a discordance between the rhythms as a form of 
arrhythmia.
Arrhythmia, as a form of pattern disruption, uses the Gaussian deviate table as the 
compositional form’s temporal element. Instead of each interval conforming to a single 
time unit, as it would if it were based on the fixed clock time of a digital signaling 
process as it is manifest in Eurhythmia and Polyrhythmia, Arrhythmia disrupts the 
rhythmic linearity by randomly changing the timing within each binary sequence. In 
this way, the sequences lose any semantic meaning as the temporal logic is disrupted. 
Lefebvre notes in listening to the city that “noise, chaotic, has no rhythm” and that the

attentive ear begins to separate out, to distinguish the sources, to bring them back 
together to perceive interactions.” [14] The use of a disruptive temporal element as a 
form of chaos allows an audience to engage with the work on two levels. At a macro-
level, the random processes of digit selection and temporal representation appear 
without rhythm as fleeting moments sound or long silences of anticipation. At the 
micro-level, the listener’s attention focuses the individual sounds of the relays before 
returning to the macro-level to hear the emergence and ebb of possible moments of 
rhythm. A notated example of an arrhythmic pattern for one sound block is shown in 
Figure 10.
DISCUSSION
A media archaeological “unpassioned listening” (as a non-hermeneutic analysis of the 
event) suggests the machine is the sole arbiter of representation and denies the 
relationship between transmitter and receiver, in this case the artefact and the 
audience. [28] The limitation of using such a material media archaeological approach 
is exposed when it comes to its creative application as an artistic method. For Ernst, of 
importance is the confluence of the artefact’s materialities in operation. For the 
audience it is the material entanglement of sound leaving one body and entering 
another that determines how it is experienced. As Jonathan Sterne notes, the 
perceptual quality of sound, as an explicit sonification of the vibrational or rhythmic 
event, is a “product of the human senses and not a thing in the world apart from

humans. Sound is a little piece of the vibrating world” and “somewhat human-
centered.” [29]
Garrett Stewart contends that an ‘evocalization’, the silent evocation of voice, occurs 
when we read. This is the vocalization that “proceeds to give voice” and encompasses 
the many organs of vocal production that Katherine Hayles describes as 
subvocalization. [30] [31] If the relay was conceived as a ‘surrogate body’ what 
happens when the text of A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates is 
read by an electro-mechanical object? [31] If the relay is a surrogate body, then Ernst’s 
inaudible vibrational or rhythmic events exist as a form of subvocalization, emerging 
when voiced by the relay. The transference of materiality from the printed page to a 
digital medium is Click::RAND#2’s explicit sonification of both a silent reading of the 
book’s text and of Ernst’s vibrational or rhythmic events without sound or voice. The 
algorithmic processes used in Click::RAND#2 allow the possibility of embodying the 0s 
and 1s as a method to expose the discrete time signalling and patterns of state 
transitions of a binary sequence in the real as a series of rhythmic clicks. [5]
Conclusion
Click::RAND#2 is the sonic articulation of a large set of true random numbers 
produced by RAND Corporation. Originally printed on Hollerith punch cards, the digit 
sets were then published in human readable book form before being published in 
digital format as data files. These data files have been creatively appropriated for 
compositional use in Click::RAND#2. From the machine rhythms of the punch card 
reader and the electromechanical computer to the prosodic rhythms of vocalizing the 
book of digits to the micro-temporal acts of repetition and regeneration in the storage 
and transmission of digital files, Click::RAND#2 re-presents the random digits as a 
series of compositions to explore the inherent rhythms present in binary encoded 
format. Using the relay as the sound producing object, the rhythmic patterning as a 
presence and absence of sound is manifested by the metallic clicking of the relays’ 
contacts. Not only do we listen to an articulation of the media in the present, but the 
work evokes a temporal connection with the past articulations of the data sets in their 
various material forms.
The work does not to seek to establish a media archaeological connection between 
present and past media constellations. Instead, the work forms an audiovisual 
relationship between two artefactual forms of media expressed through a series of 
binary sequences. By doing so, Click::RAND#2 bridges two distinct temporalities. In

the immediate present the appropriation of a set of random digits, reduced to a primal 
level as 0s and 1s are expressed by operatively engaging a series of relays as an 
expression of themselves and of the inherent rhythms of binary sequences. As an 
evocation of the past Click::RAND#2 is an expression of the sounds of mid-20th century 
electro-mechanical relay-based computers; a time when those machines would have 
utilized sets of random digits to perform analytical and probabilistic calculations. As a 
form of media archaeological anamnesis4, the rhythmic chattering of the relays seeks 
to establish a point of connection and recollection of this past media moment. Using 
Henri Lefebvre’s rhythmanalysis as a framework for the embodied response to the 
aurality of Click::RAND#2 provides a context for the compositional realization and 
experience of the work. Rather than create a binary opposition of objective and 
subjective interpretations of non-human and human perspectives the artefact’s sound, 
both viewpoints have been incorporated and represented in Click::RAND#2. As such, 
both forms of embodiment, that of the object and the audience, can serve the 
rhythmanalyst as primal sources for the interpretation of knowledge.
