ABSTRACT
We present new results combining data from a previously published study of the 
mapping design process and a new replication of the same method with a group of 
participants having different background expertise. Our thematic analysis of 
participants' interview responses reveal some design criteria common to both groups 
of participants: mappings must manage the balance of control between the instrument 
and the player, and they should be easy to understand for the player and audience. We 
also consider several criteria that distinguish the two groups' evaluation strategies.  
We conclude with important discussion of the mapping designer's perspective, 
performance with gestural controllers, and the difficulties of evaluating mapping 
designs and musical instruments in general.

Introduction
A digital musical instrument (DMI) might be viewed as composed of a control 
interface, a sound synthesizer, and a mapping that connects the two [1].  This model of 
the instrument suggests that the careful design of the mapping is at least as important 
as the design of the control interface and the sound synthesizer [2]. Numerous studies 
provide evidence that this is true, showing that the mapping design affects how an 
instrument feels [3], how it engages the player [4], and even how the audience 
appreciates a performance [5].
Although the literature is clear that mappings are vitally important, it remains unclear 
exactly how to design a mapping that allows the designer to achieve their design goals. 
Indeed, it is not clear what design goals are most common or important, let alone how 
mappings can be designed to achieve them. Much of the literature reports on the 
insights gained by digital instrument designers through their practice of making 
instruments, e.g. [6][7], where design criteria for mappings are implied by broader 
recommendations for DMI design in general. In works focused specifically on the 
design of mappings, the literature often focuses on the structural, topological, and

technical aspects of the mapping design, such as recommending the use of 
intermediary layer [8], dimensionality reduction [9], machine learning [10], and other 
novel implementation techniques. In all of this work, the specific design goals of the 
instrument and/or mapping are often only implied by the context of the presentation.
In this paper, we explore mapping design criteria using a novel approach. Rather than 
reporting on the insights of a single or small group of designers, as is usually done in 
the literature, our study considers the design goals of a relatively large number of 
skilled NIME users when making a mapping for live performance, and the criteria that 
they use to evaluate whether their mapping design allows them to achieve their goals. 
Two groups of participants were asked to design a mapping effective for a live 
performance, and then to reflect on their design process and decisions.  We examine 
what our participants considered to be important properties for their mappings to 
have, and consider how these criteria may change in relation to the designer's 
experience with the gestural controller used. Finally, we situate the role of mapping 
design and its evaluation criteria in the overall DMI design process.
Method
This paper reports on novel analyses of the dataset produced in a previously reported 
study, combined with a new dataset produced by repeating the same methodology with 
a new group of participants who have additional experience using the T-Stick. The 
main method of the study has been explained in detail in prior publications [11][12].  
In addition, details and software needed to replicate the study are available in an 
online appendix.
Two groups of participants followed the same study methodology. Participants were 
invited to make a mapping that they would consider effective for a live performance, 
using a T-Stick [13] as interface, a generic subtractive synthesizer for sound 
production, and Webmapper+libmapper [14] as an environment for making the 
mapping.  These tools were chosen for their availability, ease of data collection, and as 
reasonable representatives of a gestural interface, sound synthesizer, and mapping 
design environment respectively. We recorded activity data with time stamps, including 
what signal associations participants created and removed, as well as changes to 
transfer functions in the associations (e.g. applying an absolute value function or 
scaling from the input to the output). 
Both groups of participants used the same version of Webmapper, and the same T-
Stick, however the closed-source commercial synthesizer plugin used in the first study 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Making Mappings: Design Criteria for Live Performance
4
(Native Instruments Massive) was replaced with an open-source Max/MSP-based re-
implementation. Although the synthesizer was not exactly the same, we feel it was 
similar enough (practically the same) such that the difference had no influence on the 
results. We were motivated to make this change in order to allow the method of the 
study to be more readily replicated and more fully examined.
Participants were asked to take at least 20 minutes but not more than 60 minutes to 
make their mapping design, after which their design was exported from Webmapper 
using its save functionality. Participants were then interviewed about their design 
process and the decisions they made. 
Participants in the first group (N=12) were musicians with 4 to 25 (mean 9.5) years of 
experience making music using DMIs. Following the first group’s completion of the 
study described in [11][12], a second group of participants was recruited (no member 
of the first group was also a member of the second group). Participants in the second 
group (N=8) were musicians having slightly more experience on average (5 to 21 
years, mean 11 years) and were distinguished from the first group by at least 3 months 
of experience working closely with the T-Stick. Participants in the first group had no 
prior experience with the T-Stick before the study.
Analysis
The results presented here stem from a thematic analysis of the interview 
transcriptions; the activity data are not referenced in these results. Transcripts from 
the first group of participants were initially analysed separately from the second 
group, according to the method described in [11][12].  The interviews were re-read in 
multiple passes, coded and re-coded several times, and finally grouped into themes 
[15].
In the follow up study with the 8 skilled T-Stick users, a similar approach was used to 
analyse the new interview transcriptions. After reading the interviews several times, 
several coding passes were taken, applying codes identified from the first study and 
introducing new codes. New codes were sorted into themes.  The interviews from the 
first study were then re-read with the new codes in mind in case they might apply to 
some of the remarks made by the first group of participants. 
A note on terminology
Participants in our study were asked to design an “effective” mapping for a live 
performance. This term was chosen very carefully. We didn’t want to bias participants 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Making Mappings: Design Criteria for Live Performance
5
to make a certain kind of mapping or adopt a certain aesthetic or design approach, 
other than limiting them to the context of live performance. We imagined that 
participants would come with diverse ideals for performance and thus with rich and 
varied design goals. Our own ideas about what makes a mapping desirable might be 
different from our participants’ ideals. Even the term “good” could be controversial; 
what if a participant wanted to make a mapping that is gritty, chaotic, and unruly? 
That could be a valid design goal, leading to an interesting performance scenario, but 
it might not be reasonably described as “good”. We also wanted to avoid terms like 
“expressive” that come loaded with a lot of cultural and historical connotation that 
might preclude certain kinds of design approach. 
We settled on the word “effective” reasoning that something is “effective” when it 
meets the relevant criteria for evaluation. The term “effective” thus only implies that 
the design should meet the criteria for evaluation, and is reasonably neutral with 
respect to what those criteria should be. We recognize that even this choice might be 
controversial. The term could have been (mis-)interpreted by the participants in the 
study to imply a certain kind of mapping design. It may be that no prompt is 
acceptably neutral to all concerned parties. Let it be noted that our terminology was 
carefully considered, and that the choice of the term “effective” was intended to imply 
as little as possible about how the mapping design should be approached and 
evaluated. 
In hindsight, perhaps we should have simply asked participants to “design a mapping 
for a live performance,” without qualifying what kind of mapping to design. Future 
research may take this approach. However, the intentionally neutral use of the word 
“effective” remains useful for discussing the results of such research.
A note on quotes and participant IDs
Some direct quotes from the interview transcripts are presented below along with the 
participant’s anonymized numeric ID. Participants in the first group are numbered 3 
through 15 (participants 1 and 2 were pilot study participants, and participant 5 was 
disqualified for lack of experience). Participants in the second group are numbered 20 
through 27, allowing them to be easily identified below. The full interview transcripts 
are available in the online appendix for reference.

Shared Themes
Based on the thematic analysis, we identified three themes that were common to both 
participant groups: control, legibility, and sound. These themes were first identified in 
the interviews with the first group of participants and were found to apply strongly to 
the second group as well, suggesting their generality regardless of prior experience 
with the control interface used in the mapping design task.
Control
The first theme identified relates to the way the mapping design gives the player a 
sense of control. 15 out of 20 participants (9/12 from the first group and 6/8 from the 
second) mentioned the way in which the mapping allows the player to control the 
synthesizer as an important aspect of a mapping’s effectiveness.  Some of these 
remarks had the quality of establishing the precise meaning of "effectiveness" as the 
participants understood the word:
I guess a good mapping is a system in which the output meets your intentions. 
(Laughs), that seems obvious, but the details of that are kind of... so varied. 
(Participant 10)
These remarks establish that, in the context of live performance, participants wished 
to deliberately perform specific actions with the intention of producing specific results 
as a consequence. The instrument and the mapping serve to empower the player with 
musical agency and allow them to make the specific sound they intend to create.
Although none of the participants in the study completely rejected the desire to control 
the sound, some also offered another perspective:
It has certain things that are controllable. [...] But it also is a little bit chaotic, and 
a little bit unpredictable, and that's actually a nice thing for me, for the type of 
music I would make. (Participant 7)
It has to be simple enough. So I still have control and kind of know what I'm doing. 
But at the same time, it's fun to have a little bit of chaos and have some sounds 
that I... I wouldn't know how to redo but somehow I made them. That's kind of 
nice, too. (Participant 24)
In this case, these participants (6 in total, 2/12 from the first group and 4/8 from the 
second) wished for the instrument, as well as the player, to have some measure of 
musical agency. Interestingly, the participants in the second group, with more 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Making Mappings: Design Criteria for Live Performance
7
experience using the T-Stick, were more likely to express appreciation for the 
instrument’s capacity to surprise and act unexpectedly. 
This theme reveals the importance of control in a live performance. Although the 
participants in our study emphasized that control should lie primarily with the player, 
they also highlighted that the instrument itself may be given some control, depending 
on the aesthetic goals of the designer and/or player. The balance of agency between 
the player and the instrument is therefore identified as a crucial aspect of the mapping 
design and of instrument design in general. 
Legibility
This theme relates to how easy the mapping is to understand, both for the player and 
the audience. Others have described this feature as "transparency" [16], but we prefer 
the term "legibility". "Legibility" implies that the mapping is a kind of text that the 
player and the audience read and interpret; we feel that this accurately reflects the 
complex social and embodied relationship of these stakeholders with the instrument 
and mapping, whereas "transparency" seems to imply some kind of physical or innate 
property of the mapping that is separate from its interpretation by the player and 
audience. 
Every participant in our study identified legibility as an important property for an 
effective mapping.
It’s fairly simple. The public has to quickly understand the link between the 
gesture and the sound. That’s it. (Participant 15)
There were three main expressions of this theme: intuition, metaphor, and correlation. 
15 out of 20 participants (9/12 from the first group and 6/8 from the second) expressed 
that an effective mapping makes sense intuitively, without having to think about it.
Something that I think is important for mappings is clarity. I want to be able to do 
something and it's clear to somebody who isn't necessarily trained in these things. 
They can understand that something has happened in terms of what they can hear, 
and it's not obscure; there is a gesture happening and you know there is 
something changing in the sound and it’s clear for the audience. (Participant 27)
11 out of 20 participants (8 in the first group and 3 in the second) employed some kind 
of metaphor or analogy to explain how they made sense of the mapping.

It’s nice actually to be able to squeeze the instrument and for it to be silent, it’s 
kind of like a resonating body, if you squeeze it it dampens it. (Participant 7)
8 out of 20 participants (6/12 in the first group and 2/8 in the second) found it effective 
when the perceptual effect of the gesture had a clear correlation with the resulting 
sound.
What I found worked well was correlating the high intensity motions to high 
intensity sonic output in my opinion, or in my perception of it. (Participant 10)
However they explained it, 19 out of 20 participants highly valued a mapping that 
made sense to them, that was easy to understand and seemed like it would be easy for 
the audience to understand as well.  This also relates to the theme of control.  With the 
theme of legibility, participants wished to be able to apprehend the cause-and-effect 
relationship between a gesture and the sound it produced. With the theme of control, 
they wished for the cause-and-effect relationship to exist in the first place.
However, beyond cause-and-effect, this theme also implies something deeper about 
what makes a mapping effective.  If music is meant to communicate something, it 
seems clear that the mapping (as part of the overall musical system) plays a role in this 
communication.  A legible mapping is one which facilitates communicating both how 
an instrument works, and how the performer's gestures relate to the sound the 
instrument makes.
Remarks about legibility dominated participants remarks about the effectiveness of 
their mapping designs, accounting for 41% of all the remarks from both groups that 
were coded under the broad category of effectiveness of mappings.
Sound
The last shared theme between the two groups is considering the sounds that the 
mapping facilitates making. It comes as no surprise that when designing a mapping for 
a live musical performance that participants would consider the sounds produced by 
the instrument. Although there was little consensus among participants about exactly 
what kind of sounds to make (indeed, no two participants made the same exact 
mapping), 13 out of 20 participants (9/12 from the first group and 4/8 from the second) 
specifically remarked about the sound, demonstrating that this was an important 
consideration in the mapping design process.

Differentiated Themes
Two themes were expressed repeatedly by participants in the second group but were 
found only infrequently in the remarks of the first group. 
Previous experience
It is clear from the second group of participants’ remarks that their previous 
experience using the T-Stick had an important effect on their design process and 
evaluation criteria. 7 out of 8 of these participants used their prior experience to guide 
their decision making process. In most cases, drawing on their prior experience 
allowed participants to make mapping decisions that they knew would work well for 
their purposes.
Because of my previous attempts, working with the T-Stick […] I had a good idea 
of why I want to use this, and maybe you could check this with the data captured, 
but that might be one of the first ones I might have used also. (Participant 26)
In terms of like doubling it and knowing that works, this is totally cheating 
because this is something I did a lot with the sopranino T-Stick when I was 
mapping for that piece. (Participant 27)
However, 3 of these participants expressed wanting to avoid repeating their previous 
mapping design choices, and instead chose to do something different during the study.
In my project, I use the pressure to control amplitude. I just wanted to try 
something else, I guess. But this is yeah, this is quite effective. Shake. (Participant 
24)
In either case, participants demonstrated that prior experience plays an important role 
in how designers evaluate their design choices. This comes as no surprise. Indeed, 
participants’ use of metaphor (described above) to explain how the mapping they made 
is legible demonstrates the important role of prior experience in a broader sense. 
However, none of the participants in the first group explicitly remarked about the role 
of prior experience in their design process, demonstrating that specific background in 
using the interface at hand in the mapping design is especially important.
Signal Quality
5 out of 8 participants in the second group described ways in which the T-Stick’s 
gestural signals played an important role in their design evaluation process. This is in 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Making Mappings: Design Criteria for Live Performance
10
contrast with only 2 out of 12 participants in the first group who mentioned the 
importance of the gestural signals themselves.
What would be useful is, in terms of data flow, I need something that is quite 
stable. Like, this is stable to me (squeezes). Because it's a clear gesture, and it 
does,  if I see the data, it's very stable. (Participant 21)
Other Themes
A handful of other themes were identified related to the way participants evaluated 
their mappings. These themes were less prominent, being remarked on by fewer 
participants overall, but often enough that they should be mentioned.
Mapping techniques
9 out of 20 participants (5/12 from the first group and 4/8 from the second group) 
described using specific implementation techniques, such as scaling, convergent 
mappings, and non-linear transfer functions, as being an important part of what made 
their mapping effective.
I think the biggest evolution was just tweaking the scaling, both of the input, and 
the output, and some of the expressions, to be able to get something that for me 
sounded a little bit less random and a little bit more controlled and repeatable. 
(Participant 12)  
If I had all the time in the world? I would from the patch that I have right now, I 
would go in further. And I would start tweaking the range of each variable to 
pinpoint areas that would be very effective, because right now I think that the 
patch, there's a lot of range in it. (Participant 23)
Amplitude control
8 out of 20 participants (4/12 from the first group and 4/8 from the second) stressed 
the importance of controlling amplitude. Many of these remarks emphasize the 
importance of being able to silence the instrument.
I want to be able to start and stop the sound easily without having to think too 
much about it. (Participant 4)
I wanted to--when you stop, when you weren't touching it, for it to be silent. I 
wanted there to need to be some energy injected into the system for it to make 
sound. (Participant 7)
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Making Mappings: Design Criteria for Live Performance
11
I need a clear parameter to stop the sound. (Participant 21)
Subjectivity
Finally, 5 out of 20 participants (4/12 in the first group and 1/8 in the second) 
emphasized that what makes a mapping effective depends on the subjective 
preferences of the mapping designer, and the context for which the design is intended 
to be used.
Depends on the context, obviously. Yeah, so there isn’t a single answer to this 
question1, even for me, let alone everybody. So it’s a hard question to generalize.  
[...] I get that it’s a crucial question. And again, I want to reassert, there’s not a 
single solution to this because lots of different instruments exist, and it’s nice to 
have the diversity. (Participant 7)
Discussion
Based on the thematic analysis of participants’ interview transcription, we are able to 
identify three important qualities that participants valued in mappings meant for live 
performance, regardless of the amount of prior experience they had with the gestural 
controller used in the study.  
An effective mapping for a live performance should consider the balance of musical 
agency between the player and the instrument, primarily empowering the player to 
perform specific sounds as they intend to, but perhaps sometimes allowing the 
instrument to behave unexpectedly.  Furthermore, an effective mapping for a live 
performance should be easy to understand, for the player as well as the audience.  This 
legibility may come from a clear metaphor or analogy, from a distinct correlation 
between the percept of the gesture and that of the sound, or perhaps from simple 
ineffable intuition. Finally, an effective mapping for live performance must allow the 
performer to produce effective sounds, although determining exactly what sounds are 
effective is outside the scope of this work. Participants in both groups also 
emphasized, though to a lesser degree, the usefulness of implementation techniques 
such as scaling and convergent mappings for designing effective mappings, as well as 
stressing the importance of being able to control the output amplitude of the 
instrument.
The Designer’s View of Mappings
The strongest theme in our participants remarks was that of legibility: an effective 
mapping is easy to understand for both the player and the audience, whether by 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Making Mappings: Design Criteria for Live Performance
12
intuition, metaphor, or apparent correspondence.  That this was the main quality by 
which participants evaluating their mappings implies something interesting about their 
perspective on the mapping.
Doug Van Nort and colleagues [17][18] identified that there are three main views of 
mappings useful for designers of mappings and mapping tools: a systems-oriented 
perspective, a functional perspective, and a perceptual perspective.  If our participants 
had adopted a functional view of their mapping designs, we would have expected them 
to remark on the topology and dimensionality of the mapping.  Such remarks were 
completely absent, perhaps unsurprisingly given the predominantly non-technical 
background of our participants.  On the other hand, given a systems-oriented view of 
their mappings, we would anticipate a large number of remarks about the structure of 
the mapping (e.g. one-to-one, divergent, convergent), and the connections chosen.  
Although participants did often mention specific connections, and the theme of 
technical implementation also suggests a systems-oriented perspective, these remarks 
were often made while otherwise justifying the effectiveness of the connection e.g. by 
its legibility or controllability.  Participants would also have been biased towards such 
remarks, since Webmapper presents a strongly systems-oriented view of the mapping.
Instead, it appears that participants were largely concerned with the perceptual 
impact of their mapping design choices.  What mattered most to them was not the 
structure or topology of the mapping, but the resulting look and feel that the mapping 
imparted on their instrument.
Performance with Gestural Controllers
The theme of control suggests that the design of the mapping can empower the 
performer with musical agency, but it can also allow the instrument itself to act 
unexpectedly, lending the instrument a certain amount of musical agency as well. That 
designers would value circumstances in which the instrument adds “a little bit of 
chaos” (Participants 7 and 21) is especially interesting compared to traditional 
acoustic musical performance. Imagine practicing a sonata on a piano that sometimes 
adds a little bit of chaos. These remarks suggest something unique about performance 
with gestural controllers that is not necessarily shared with other kinds of musical 
practice. A digital musical instrument has the potential to act in the role of a 
collaborator in a way that acoustic instruments do not, or at least do differently.
The theme of legibility also suggests something interesting about this performance 
context. It’s not unusual for instance that a piano player’s hands should be invisible to 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Making Mappings: Design Criteria for Live Performance
13
much of the audience without seriously detracting from this part of the audience’s 
enjoyment of the music; the player’s gestures, while certainly adding something, are 
not an essential part of the performance. Yet participants in this study strongly 
emphasize that the gestures made when performing with the T-Stick should have a 
clear and meaningful relationship with the sound, suggesting that the gestures of the T-
Stick player are somehow a more essential consideration than e.g. those of a piano 
player. 
Subjectivity and Design Goals
The themes of control and legibility may be considered as criteria for live performance 
itself as much as they are criteria for designing mappings meant for that context. This 
relates to the theme of subjectivity identified in the interview transcripts. Design 
criteria are inherently context and goal dependent. It may well be that designer's 
evaluation criteria are relatively independent of the interface, sound synthesizer, and 
design tools they use; instead, design intent and context of use may have a greater 
influence.  
If this is the case, we might expect practitioners to describe similar evaluation criteria 
based solely on a stated design goal and context, even without the rigmarole of asking 
them to actually perform a mapping design.  This could be verified by simply 
interviewing DMI designers about their mapping design goals and evaluation criteria 
outside the context of a user study.
Limitations
It's important to insist on the limitations of the results presented here.  Most 
significantly, participants had relatively little time to develop their mapping designs 
(20 - 60 minutes), and they were asked to make a mapping for a live performance 
context.  It seems very likely that given more time or a different design context, 
participants would have approached the design differently. 
The results presented here may reasonably be expected to reflect the evaluation 
process that a mapping designer would use in their first sessions working on a new 
mapping.  It seems reasonable that many of the considerations in such a first 
encounter, those criteria reflected in the themes above, would continue to play a role 
even in a longer design process.  However, the relative importance of these criteria 
over time is not certain and cannot be indicated by the data from our study.

Future Work
The results of our study are not known to generalize to mapping design over a longer 
period, using a different controller, synthesizer, or mapping environment, or when the 
design goals and context are different from live performance. Future work must 
consider how mapping design criteria differ depending on these important factors. It 
seems likely that design goals and context should be the most important factor in 
determining evaluation criteria; as such, future work should work to shed light on the 
diverse goals of artists and mapping designers so that criteria for mapping design can 
be situated in relation to these goals.
We are also curious to consider the influence that the mapping design environment 
may have had on participants evaluation criteria. We wonder if participants would have 
designed different mappings and evaluated them according to different criteria had 
they been using a tool where the design process is based on demonstrating input-
output relationships, e.g. [19] or [20].
Conclusion
As music technology continues to proliferate, the design of mappings is likely to 
become increasingly important. The inherent nature of music technology as well as its 
historical development both result in an abundance of modular devices that are most 
useful when combined together: controllers, synthesizers, sound processors, 
recorders, sequencers, and so on. Mappings are the connective tissue that bind these 
otherwise separate devices together. They are at the core of digital musical 
instruments, and we would argue that they are at the core of most forms of electronic 
artistic practice. As such, it is crucial to develop a better understanding of how 
mappings are designed, and what makes certain mappings effective. This information 
will help researchers and developers to imagine more useful tools for making 
mappings between modular devices, as well as helping designers to make more 
effective mappings for fully integrated musical instruments.
