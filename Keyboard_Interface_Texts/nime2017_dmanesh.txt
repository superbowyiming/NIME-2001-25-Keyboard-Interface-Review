ABSTRACT
Exquisite Score is a web application which allows users to
collaborate on short musical compositions using the para-
digm of the parlor game exquisite corpse. Through a MIDI-
sequencer interface, composers each contribute a section to
a piece of music, only seeing the very end of the preceding
section. Exquisite Score is both a fun and accessible com-
positional game as well as a system for encouraging highly
novel musical compositions. Exquisite Score was tested by
several students and musicians. Several short pieces were
created and a brief discussion and analysis of these pieces
is included.

1. INTRODUCTION
Exquisite corpse is a game popularized by surrealists in the
1920’s wherein artists collectively assemble an image. In one
variation of the game, also known as picture consequences,
three players begin by folding a paper into thirds. Player
one draws a head in the top third of the paper, extending
the lines just over the edge to the middle third. Player one
then folds the paper and passes it on to player two. Player
two, seeing only the bottom edge of player one’s drawing,
draws a torso and arms on the middle third of the paper,
again extending lines slightly over into the bottom third.
Player two then folds the paper again, passing it to player
three, who, seeing only the bottom lines from the arms and
torso, ﬁnishes by drawing the legs [10].
In another, word-based variation, players begin by agree-
ing on a sentence structure, for example“Theadjective noun
verbs the adjective noun.” Players then pass around a pa-
per, ﬁlling out the sentence one word at a time, unaware
of the preceding words. The name exquisite corpse comes
from a particular sentence created in this manner: “ Le ca-

davre exquis boira le vin nouveau,” meaning “the exquisite
corpse shall drink the new wine” [7].
Exquisite Score aims to bring the creativity and novelty
of the exquisite corpse paradigm to musical composition.
1.1 Elements of the Exquisite Corpse Paradigm
While many variations of the exquisite corpse game exist,
all share the same basic idea: a piece of art is collabora-
tively constructed by several artists and each artist receives
only limited information about the previous artists’ contri-
butions.
To describe aspects of the exquisite corpse, this paper will
make use of the following terminology:
Fragment The artistic contribution of one individual. Mul-
tiple fragments are stitched together to form a com-
plete piece.
Occlusion Refers to what is blocked from each contributor.
In the drawing game, all but the edge of the paper are
occluded.
Hint The section of the previous fragment or fragments
that a contributor sees when they create their own
fragment.
Shared Region The area of a contributor’s fragment that
will be seen by other contributors. The shared region
for one contributor becomes the hint for the next.
Contextual Backbone The extra context a contributor
has beyond the hint. For example, a contributor might
know they are meant to be drawing legs.
2. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART
The exquisite corpse paradigm easily lends itself to musi-
cal composition and several musical exquisite corpses exist.
One example is an hour-long exquisite corpse piece com-
missioned and performed by the Zephyr Quartet for the
Adelaide Festival of the Arts in 2016 [4]. The piece was
constructed by twelve composers who each saw only the
end of the previous composer’s fragment. Another example
is a set of collaborative pieces featured on the website Think
Jar Collective, where each piece was assembled by six com-
posers. Instead of breaking up the composition into tempo-
ral segments, composers each contributed a single track and
the ﬁnished product is all the tracks played simultaneously
[2].
Exquisite Score aims to bring the musical exquisite corpse
to a wider audience by enabling easy exquisite-corpse style
composition in an online environment. Similar online ap-
plications exist for non-musical exquisite corpses. One ex-
ample is Xavier Barrade’s Epic Exquisite Corpse, an online
implementation of a drawing-based exquisite corpse. The
93
website is a single, massive black-and-white collage com-
posed of over 75,000 contributions [9]. Unlike in Picture
Consequences, where the complete picture is supposed to
be a human-like ﬁgure, Epic Exquisite Corpse has no con-
textual backbone: there are no guidelines for what the com-
pleted picture should be.
Another online example is Folding Story, a website which
lets users play a word-based version of exquisite corpse. In
Folding Story, each user contributes a fragment to a story
based only on the previous fragment, where each fragment
is fewer than 180 characters. Additional context is given
to contributors in the form of their fragment’s position and
the total number of fragments in the story [3].
3. GOALS AND MOTIV ATION
3.1 Design goals
The overall goal of this project is to make an online system
which allows users to compose a piece of music using the
exquisite corpse paradigm. Before starting, we set out three
design goals which informed the development of Exquisite
Score and which can serve as a framework for evaluating
the project’s success. The goals are as follows:
3.1.1 Compelling Collaborative Pieces
Individual contributions should be stitched together to cre-
ate a complete piece, and the system needs to be powerful
and general enough such that the resulting piece can be mu-
sically interesting and compelling. It should be clear who
composed which sections of the piece so listeners can un-
derstand the overall compositional narrative.
3.1.2 Meaningful Occlusion
Enough of the previous work on a composition should be
hidden so that the next composed section is surprising and
perhaps unusual, but not a total non-sequitur. The oc-
clusion should facilitate pieces to be locally cohesive but
globally meandering.
3.1.3 Accessibility to Non-composers
A good comparison for accessibility is the paper-and-pencil
version of exquisite corpse. Most people can fold over a pa-
per, pick up a pencil, and draw. Naturally better artists
may produce better individual sections, but that does not
preclude amateur artists from enjoying the game and pro-
ducing a satisfying result. Similarly, someone with minimal
compositional experience should be able to contribute to a
piece with this system.
3.2 Motivation
Apart from being an amusing diversion, a system like Exquisite
Score has educational and artistic value.
3.2.1 Educational Value
Applying the exquisite corpse paradigm to music allows
users to explore musical composition through both prac-
tice and observation. In terms of practice, the exquisite
corpse lowers some of the barriers to composition, making
it easier for novices to engage with music. One such barrier
is commitment: it is easier to commit to writing a single
ﬁfteen-second fragment than a complete two-minute piece.
Another barrier is self-consciousness or fear: a composer has
less pressure in an exquisite corpse because composition is
presented as a game where pieces are expected to sound
strange and disjoint as the result of occlusion. Besides sim-
ply encouraging composition, the exquisite corpse provides
the unique challenge of working oﬀ of someone else’s compo-
sition, forcing the composer to start from source material
that might be very diﬀerent from what they would have
composed themselves.
In addition to compositional practice, the exquisite corpse
encourages users to engage with music through observation
and listening. Users are exposed to several fragments from
a variety of composers with diﬀerent styles and skill levels.
Furthermore, if the hints and shared regions are marked in
the ﬁnal composition, the listener can examine closely how
each composer connects their fragment to the hint they were
given. This provides a more directed listening experience
and allows the user to consider what they might have done
diﬀerently given the same information.
3.2.2 Artistic Value
Andr´ e Breton described the exquisite corpse as “an infalli-
ble means of sending the mind’s critical mechanism away on
vacation and fully releasing its metaphorical potentialities”
[1]. In a way, the exquisite corpse enforces artiﬁcial creativ-
ity. Pieces composed using the exquisite corpse paradigm
probably would not have come about without the occlu-
sive elements. The resulting pieces may be meandering or
disjoint, but they might also be creative and adventurous.
There is a tradeoﬀ: unity and intention versus creativity
and surprise.
If one views the exquisite corpse as a method for generat-
ing spontaneity and surprise in music, it is worth compar-
ing it with the ultimate form of spontaneous collaboration
in music: improvisation. In improvisation, players typically
get to hear all other contributions, but they must produce
music on the spot, and players do not necessarily have the
time or memory to fully process everyone else’s contribu-
tions. The spontaneity and creativity in improvisation are
the result of the immediacy of sound creation. Through
occlusion, the exquisite corpse provides a diﬀerent avenue
for spontaneity, resulting in less pressure and more time to
think.
4. SYSTEM DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION
4.1 A Musical Exquisite Corpse
As discussed earlier, there are many variants of the exquisite
corpse paradigm across diﬀerent media, with diﬀerent con-
textual backbones and diﬀering levels of occlusion. Exquisite
Score implements a musical variation with partial occlusion
and a weak contextual backbone. The game is played as
follows: First, someone sets up the parameters of the piece,
such as instrumentation, fragment length, and piece length.
Then, the ﬁrst user composes a fragment of music, maybe
eight measures long. Each consecutive composer will see
a short hint from the previous composer, say the last four
measures. In addition, each composer is told where their
fragment occurs in the piece, e.g. “now composing fragment
6 of 8.” This constitutes the only additional information for
the contextual backbone.
This scheme can be thought of as linear, temporal occlu-
sion. It is linear because the fragments are composed in the
order they will be played in the ﬁnal piece, and it is tempo-
ral because composers have full information about what the
hint sounds like and about what their fragment will sound
like: no sounds are hidden during those time slices. A possi-
ble alternative to temporal occlusion is part-wise occlusion,
for instance, if one composer writes a bassline and two other
composers write a duet over the bassline, only seeing the
bassline and not the other melody. Temporal occlusion was
chosen because of its conceptual simplicity and because it
encourages local cohesion: even if composers cannot control
what happens before and after their fragment, they can at
least have complete control over their temporal slice.
94
Besides arranging the fragments in the order they are
composed, there are many other plausible arrangements.
For example the beginning and end of a piece could be com-
posed ﬁrst, and the middle fragment last, wherein the mid-
dle fragment would receive a hint from both of its neighbors.
We chose the linear construction because of its simplicity,
though additional models are brieﬂy explored in [5].
4.2 System Description
Exquisite Score is a web application which uses the Python
Flask framework connected to a PostgreSQL database. It is
hosted on a virtual machine and is, at the time of writing,
accessible at https://exquisitescore.xyz.
The client presents a musical editor created in HTML and
Javascript using SVG and HTML5 canvas elements. For
audio playback, Exquisite Score makes use of the MIDI.js
library which synthesizes notes by playing samples via the
WebAudio API.
Exquisite Score has individual user accounts and uses
Google to authenticate and log in. With user accounts, we
can assign an identity to each fragment. This allows users
to see who composed each fragment and also ensures that a
composer is unable to compose two consecutive fragments.
A user signs in and is presented with a list of pieces, some
in-progress and some completed. From here, the user can
click on an in-progress piece to contribute a fragment, click
on a ﬁnished piece to listen, or create a new piece.
4.3 Composing a Fragment
The compositional interface is a piano-roll style MIDI se-
quencer, similar to the standard MIDI editors found in
many digital audio workstations like Ableton Live or Garage
Band. Notes occupy a large grid, where the x-axis denotes
time and the y-axis denotes pitch. A user can create new
notes and move, lengthen, shorten or delete existing notes.
Users can toggle audio playback so they can listen to what
they have composed so far.
If the fragment being composed is not the ﬁrst fragment,
the composition starts oﬀ with a greyed-out, un-editable
hint section, the end of the previous composer’s fragment.
An example is shown in Figure 1. If the current fragment
is not the ﬁnal fragment of the piece, the section at the
end of the fragment is marked as the shared region, which
becomes the hint for the next composer. Figure 2 shows
how the shared region is demarcated. A composer cannot
submit a piece if there are no notes in the shared region.
Figure 1: At the start of each fragment, the com-
poser is presented with a hint from the previous
fragment.
When a user starts composing, a lock is placed on the
piece which prevents other users from composing a new
fragment for that piece at the same time. To ﬁnalize a
fragment, the user clicks the submit button, which saves
that fragment and releases the lock on the piece. If a user
leaves a fragment unattended for more than thirty minutes,
the fragment is deleted and the lock on the piece is released.
Figure 2: The end of a fragment with the shared re-
gion marked. This fragment immediately precedes
the fragment in Figure 1, so the shared region here
is presented as the hint in Figure 1
4.4 Viewing Pieces
Once a fragment is submitted, the composer is allowed to
view the entire piece up to and including their contribution.
This is done so the composer can see how their fragment
ﬁts in with the previous sections while their contribution is
still fresh in memory. The alternative is to prevent anyone
from viewing a piece until it is completed. This would be
impractical because there is no guarantee for how long it
takes to complete a piece and it is possible a piece will never
be completed at all, meaning the composer would never get
to see how their fragment is incorporated.
Any user can view any completed piece, even if they are
not signed in. When viewing a piece, users are brought
to a screen similar to the compositional interface, but with
editing disabled. The start of each fragment is labelled with
the composer’s name so that users can follow the narrative
of how the piece was created as it plays.
If a user has not yet contributed to an in-progress piece,
that user is not able to view it, since this would enable them
to bypass the occlusion.
4.5 Creating a Piece
When creating a piece, the user chooses a variety of pa-
rameters relating to the piece’s instrumentation and overall
form. The instrumentation parameters are the number of
tracks, the instrument patch for each track (chosen from
the General MIDI set), and the volume and pitch range per
instrument. The form-related parameters are the fragment
length, the number of fragments in the piece, and the length
of the hint.
5. EV ALUATION AND ANALYSIS
Exquisite Score was tested by 34 subjects, including profes-
sional composers and university students with varying mu-
sical backgrounds. Each subject composed at least one frag-
ment, and in total, ﬁve pieces were completed, each com-
prised of eight fragments. In addition, 19 of the subjects
completed a survey about their experience.
Based on the survey results, subjects generally enjoyed
Exquisite Score. In the open-ended feedback, many sub-
jects explicitly mentioned they found the experience fun.
Subjects were delighted to see how the pieces evolved and
how their contributions ﬁt in. One subject said “I had a lot
of fun composing a thing and listening to it afterwards - it
wasn’t quite what I expected from the snippet I’d heard.”
Another subject mentioned they were surprised that their
fragment“ended up in a totally diﬀerent genre”from the rest
of the piece. Subjects also enjoyed listening to other com-
pleted pieces. One subject noted “It was interesting to see
how other people took bits from the parts they’d been able
to see to try to make it ﬂow nicely, but it still sounded really
95
interesting.” Overall the occlusion seems to have worked
nicely: enough was hidden that the pieces evolved and ex-
plored a breadth of musical ideas, but enough was shared
between fragments such that one fragment could transition
smoothly into the next.
The surveys also showed that subjects’ experiences var-
ied based on their prior levels of compositional and musical
experience. Unsurprisingly, professional composers tended
to ask for more power and versatility in the editor, for in-
stance including the ability to change the rhythmic grid,
add new instruments, or expand the pitch range for each
instrument. On the other hand, subjects who were not fa-
miliar with musical composition sometimes found the in-
terface intimidating. One subject oﬀered the suggestion of
including an option to limit the notes to certain keys to
make composing more approachable. The results indicate
that in its current state, Exquisite Score oﬀers a better ex-
perience to those with prior musical training. Though the
system is still usable by novices, some combination of sim-
plifying the interface and providing lessons or tutorials may
make Exquisite Score even more beginner-friendly.
5.1 Qualitative Analysis
The resulting pieces had a large degree of novelty and vari-
ation and made for quite a fun and enjoyable listen. Each
fragment lasts for about 10 seconds, which seemed just
long enough for a composer to start developing an idea.
Of course, because of occlusion, the next composer usually
could not follow through on the previous musical idea, so in
the end there were at least as many musical ideas as frag-
ments. Besides juggling several motifs, pieces also hopped
around between diﬀerent genres and styles. For example,
in a piece titled “The Funk,” the third fragment sounds like
dance music while the fourth sounds like a children’s song,
and later, the sixth sounds markedly abstract and nebulous
while the seventh is a simple melodic line with minimal ac-
companiment.
Despite all the variation, pieces ended up sounding mostly
continuous and fragments usually transitioned smoothly from
one to the next. One common way composers joined their
fragment with the previous one was by repeating the bassline.
An example of this from “Piece 1” is shown in ﬁgures 3
and 4. Here, the bassline pattern that ﬁrst appears in the
shared region of the fourth fragment is copied and repeated
through the entire ﬁfth fragment. The bassline even contin-
ues through the beginning of the sixth fragment, though it
changes partway through, and of course is lost for the rest
of the piece. Still, this is a rare occurrence, since musical
material from one fragment usually does not make it past
its immediate neighbor.
Figure 3: The bassline ﬁgure from the end of the
fourth fragment is repeated throughout the ﬁfth
fragment.
Figure 4: The bassline from the end of the fourth
fragment persists all the way until the start of the
sixth, where it is later abandoned.
Many composers managed to create continuity through
harmony and style. This is especially apparent in “Piece 2,”
where fragments two through six were written by profes-
sional composers. The harmonies transition ﬂawlessly from
fragment to fragment, and the general style and texture
stays the same. Although virtually no motivic material is
shared between these fragments, they still sound as if they
were composed by just one person. The seventh fragment
in “Piece 2,” shown in ﬁgure 5, is particularly amusing. The
harmonic transition from the sixth fragment is seamless,
and the seventh fragment even expands upon a rhythmic
motive from the sixth fragment, repeating it with diminu-
tion to build tension. Halfway through, the composer de-
cides to play a joke and very abruptly transitions to a simple
version of Jingle Bells. The entire hint for the composer of
the eighth fragment is just the tune of Jingle Bells, so the
very successful continuity we get from the ﬁrst six-and-a-
half fragments is thwarted, and the piece ends with a slightly
more ornamented version of Jingle Bells.
Figure 5: An excerpt from one of the completed
pieces with the bassline omitted. Half-way through
the seventh fragment, the composer plays a joke and
abruptly switches to “Jingle Bells.”

5.2 Quantitative Analysis
In order to quantitatively measure the continuity of a piece,
we analyzed the corpus of submitted pieces by measuring
the similarity between musical fragments.
5.2.1 Deﬁning a Similarity Metric
The overall strategy for measuring similarity between two
fragments is to ﬁrst convert the fragments into normalized
feature vectors and then to take the dot product of those
feature vectors to get the similarity score, also known as the
cosine similarity [8].
The features we used were inspired by the MIDI feature
extractor jSymbolic [6] and included attack density, average
note duration, fraction of attacks on oﬀbeats, average pitch,
prevalence of minor, major, diminished and augmented tri-
ads, pitch class variety, and, for each pitch class, the pro-
portion of all notes with that pitch class.
When analyzing a fragment, we ﬂattened the individual
parts, ignoring instrumentation. Instrumentation was ig-
nored because the composers did not actually get to choose
this, and it would artiﬁcially make fragments within the
same piece look more similar to each other. Diﬀerent parts
were ﬂattened because some pieces had only two parts while
others had three, though one could imagine a more robust
analysis which separated parts based on whether or not they
were melody or accompaniment.
Many features needed normalization in order to prevent
them from dominating the feature vector. For example,
although features like the major triad prevalence cannot be
more than 1.0, the average pitch of a fragment might be
something like 62 (MIDI for D5). In order to ensure each
feature ranged from 0 to 1, for each feature not bounded by
1, we normalized that feature by dividing by the maximum
value among all the fragments.
5.2.2 Results
One way to measure continuity is to examine how a piece
evolves from its initial fragment. To do this, we took the
ﬁrst fragment of each piece and compared the similarity
score between this fragment and each later fragment. One
would expect the ﬁrst fragment to be most similar to the
ﬁrst few fragments and relatively unrelated to the later ones.
In Figure 6, we graph the similarity scores from the ﬁrst
fragment to each subsequent fragment for two pieces: “Piece
1” and “Piece 3.” In this case, we only used the propor-
tional pitch class prevalences for the feature vector. For
these pieces, the results matches our expectations: frag-
ments closer to the ﬁrst fragment have higher similarity
scores. For this analysis, the results were a lot noisier when
taking into account the full set of features for the feature
vector.
Another way to measure the continuity in a piece is to
measure the similarity between adjacent fragments. For ex-
ample, if fragment B was composed right after fragment
A, we would expect A to be more similar to B than to a
random fragment. To measure this, we took each pair of
adjacent fragments A and B and calculated a “comparative
similarity score” deﬁned as the fraction of fragments C for
which A · B ≥ A · C. A score of 1 .0 means that A is more
similar to B than to every other fragment, while a score of
0.5 indicates that A is not correlated with B.
The comparative similarity score can be calculated for
fragments in the same piece which are two away, three away,
four away, and so on. Figure 7 shows that when looking
at the average of these comparative similarity scores, frag-
ments which are closer together seem to be more correlated.
Figure 6: For “Piece 1” and “Piece 3,” the similar-
ity score between the ﬁrst fragment and each sub-
sequent fragment within the piece. The dashed line
marked “global average” represents the average sim-
ilarity score between the ﬁrst fragment and every
other fragment, even from diﬀerent pieces. Here,
the similarity score only uses the 12-dimensional
vector containing the proportional prevalence of
each pitch class.
Figure 7: The average comparative similarity scores
for fragments which are one away, two away, three
away, etc. As expected, fragments which are closer
together appear to be more similar.

6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper we presented Exquisite Score, an online system
for creating collaborative musical compositions using the
paradigm of the parlor game exquisite corpse. Exquisite
Score enabled several people with varying musical ability to
come together to create short, quirky musical compositions.
In the future, we plan to further explore variations on
the exquisite corpse paradigm. One idea we have started to
explore is including pieces with automatically repeated sec-
tions [5]. For example, one could have a piece where the ﬁrst
composed fragment appears every four fragments. This in-
creases continuity within a piece and also enables the same
hint to be given to multiple composers, allowing users to
see how diﬀerent composers react to the same starting ma-
terial. In addition, if a composer works on a fragment that
comes right before the repetition of a previously-composed
fragment, the hint can be the beginning of the repeated
fragment, rather than the end of the preceding one.
Another way to explore the exquisite corpse paradigm is
to allow other types of occlusion. For instance, users might
compose for one track at a time, with all but one other track
hidden.
Also of interest is testing Exquisite Score in a variety
of settings. For example, it would be interesting to see
Exquisite Score played as an actual parlor game, with sev-
eral users in the same room composing a fragment and virtu-
ally passing pieces from one composer to the next. It would
also be worthwhile to explore Exquisite Score’s potential
as an educational tool, perhaps presented with a simpliﬁed
interface or paired with a compositional tutorial.
For analysis, we would like to explore a more robust sim-
ilarity metric for comparing musical fragments. To actu-
ally test the eﬀects of occlusion, it would be informative to
compare fragment similarity for pieces with a varying hint
size, including pieces with total occlusion (i.e. no hint) and
pieces with no occlusion at all.
