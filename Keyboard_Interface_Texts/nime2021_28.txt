ABSTRACT
This paper discusses findings from a survey on interfaces for making electronic music. 
We invited electronic music makers of varying experience to reflect on their practice 
and setup and to imagine and describe their ideal interface for music-making. We also 
asked them to reflect on the state of gestural controllers, machine learning, and 
artificial intelligence in their practice. We had 118 people respond to the survey, with 
40.68% professional musicians, and 10.17% identifying as living with a disability or 
access requirement. Results highlight limitations of music-making setups as perceived 
by electronic music makers, reflections on how imagined novel interfaces could 
address such limitations, and positive attitudes towards ML and AI in general.

Introduction
The authors of this paper, like many in the NIME community, share a passion for 
practice-based research and participatory design methods in the creation of new 
digital musical instruments. In a year of travel restrictions and life-saving physical 
distancing measures, the pandemic has halted our creation of live real-time interactive 
performances and installations, and our ability to connect with participants at music 
therapy sessions and aged-care facilities. Putting our practice aside and the minimal 
pivots we made towards some online creative output, this paper presents an attempt to 
reach out to the community of electronic music-makers through an online survey 
conducted while much of our creative practice and research in hands-on participatory 
workshops was on pause. 
For us, this was an opportunity to ask electronic music-makers of varying experience 
about their practice and setup, and invite them to imagine and describe their ideal 
interface, if such a thing could exist. Of particular interest was to take our findings 
from all the musicians surveyed into the field of Accessible Digital Musical Instruments 
(ADMIs). Musicians with disability are particularly under-represented in the global

music community [1]. In Australia, for example, 4.5 million people (18% of the 
population) identify as living with a disability [2], while only 1078 (7%) of the 15,400 
practicing musicians live with disability [3]. Furthermore, musicians with disability 
have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 [1].
In previous work, we argue that the design of ‘conventional’ Digital Musical 
Instruments (DMIs) for professional use should inform the design of ADMIs [4], and 
that artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and gestural technology are 
under-utilised in the field [5]. This paper argues that designing for people with 
disability makes for more inclusive musical instruments which can inform the design of 
all instruments, and our intent is to use the findings from this survey to inform the 
design of future (A)DMIs.  The purpose of this paper is to give voice to people with 
disability in the NIME community, hence we have chosen to present much of the 
findings through quotes made by participants.
Background
Accessible Digital Musical Instruments
The field of ADMIs is growing rapidly. Indeed, the theme at last year’s NIME 
conference was ‘Accessibility of Musical Expression.’ ADMI researchers are starting to 
turn to novel technologies, however, gestural ADMIs are still surprisingly rare, as is 
the use of ML[5]. One of the main barriers voiced by musicians with disability in 
participating in music-making is graded examinations [1] – competing with musicians 
without disability in how to correctly play particular pieces of music on traditional 
instruments - designed by musicians without disability, for musicians without disability. 
One of the greatest opportunities in the field of ADMIs is that these instruments have 
no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ way of being played. ADMIs hence invite curiosity, exploration and 
a sense of empowerment. In a music-making context, empowerment is about being 
able to access the experience of music, and regain the rights to hear, play and express 
music, attaining autonomy and agency through creativity [6]. Within the NIME 
community, this empowerment must go a step further,  inviting and supporting 
musicians with disability to hack, code and build their own custom instruments - 
designed by musicians with disability, for musicians with disability.  
Motivated to learn more about how electronic musicians engage with their practice, 
we set out to distribute an online survey targeting musicians with disability, but not 
excluding any participants from taking part.

Previous  Surveys on DMIs
A previous survey focusing on people’s relationship to their musical tools was 
presented in [7]. The authors used a phenomenological and qualitative approach 
focusing on the experience of playing, composing for, and designing digital versus 
acoustic instruments. The survey was primarily aimed at instrumentalists and people 
making their own instruments or compositions using audio programming tools. Similar 
to the work presented in our paper, the authors asked a question about people’s 
‘dream software’ (what kind of interfaces people would like to use and if people found 
that the limitations of instruments are a source of frustration or inspiration). Findings 
suggested that an important difference between digital versus acoustic instruments is 
that digital instruments can be created for specific needs, whereas acoustic 
instruments require the player to mould oneself to the instrument. However, 
accessibility was not a theme in this study.
A survey aiming to look beyond distinct communities in order to identify trends in DMI 
use across a wide variety of genres and practices was presented in [8]. Findings 
suggested that durability, portability, and ease of use were of the greatest importance 
for electronic musicians. 
A survey on the uptake of music AI software was recently published in [9]. Results 
indicated that participants generally showed optimism towards the future potential of 
AI tools, rather than present utility, with those with more programming experience 
showing higher skepticism towards the current state and future potential of AI. 
Other than surveys of music technology use in the field of music therapy [10] [11], 
little work has been done in investigating the use of DMIs by people with disability. In 
previous surveys on DMIs and music AI software, there is also no mention of whether 
any of the participants identified as living with a disability. This, despite the fact that 
results from [1] showed that 20% of the instruments used by music-makers with 
disabilities were DMIs. 
Methodology
We sent the call out for the survey in January through various avenues1 targeting 
people with disability. Unfortunately, we only managed to collect 12 answers from 
persons with disability, despite these attempts.  
The questionnaire was divided into four sections:
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Reimagining (Accessible) Digital Musical Instruments: A Survey on Electronic
Music-Making Tools
5
1) Personal details: a set of demographic questions on age, gender identity, nationality, 
country of residence, and whether the person identified as living with a disability or 
had any access requirements. For those who identified as living with a disability, there 
was also a question about the use of assistive technologies. 
2) Electronic music experience:  questions about the musical expertise and context of 
use of electronic musical instruments. Participants were asked  how long they had 
been creating electronic music, if they had any formal electronic music training, and if 
they usually play or perform electronic music with others. 
3) Current practice and setup: questions focused on hardware and software used in 
participant’s electronic music-making setup and if any custom-built or hacked 
technologies or tools were used, i.e. if participants built their own interfaces for 
musical expression. We also asked what the setup was used for (to perform live, to 
compose, to play with others and/or to play at home) and if there were any limitations 
or frustrations of this setup. Finally, we included a question about if/how participants’ 
practice had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (and if so, how), since this 
might affect other survey responses.  
4) Imaging DMIs: three questions in free-text form, focusing on 1) the idea of an ideal 
interface that would allow you to create exactly the music that you would want to 
make, what that interface would look like and how it would work, 2) a question about 
the use of gestural in-air controllers and if and how that could be used in current 
practice, and 3) a question about if and how ML and AI could be used in the 
participants’ practice.  
The questionnaire and data are available as supplementary material2.
Analysis 
Multiple-choice questions were analysed using frequency metrics. Open-ended 
questions were analysed using thematic content analysis [12] with category counts; 
free text answers were encoded into different categories based on thematic keywords. 
Responses related to similar keywords were grouped together, whereafter occurrence 
for respective keyword category was calculated. The analysis was carried out by both 
authors, independently, whereafter themes were discussed and merged into a joint 
categorisation. Themes had to include at least 3 quotes from 3 participants to be 
included.

Participants with disability had created electronic music for an average of 9.92 years 
(median 10.5, min 1, max 21 years). Among these participants,  58.33% had received 
formal training in electronic music, and 41.67% were self-taught. The ratio of these 
participants that played/performed electronic music with others was 83.33%.
Results
Current Setup
The purpose(s) of use for the current setup is summarised in Fig. 2. The most common 
use case was composing (83.90%). This was followed by playing music at home 
(70.34%), performing live (55.93%) and playing with others (49.15%).  For participants 
with disability, 91.67% used their setup to compose, 66.67% to perform live, 58.33% to 
play with others, and 58.33% to play at home. 
The most commonly used hardware and software types are displayed in Fig. 3-4, 
respectively. Interestingly, 69.49% stated that they used other hardware than the ones 
suggested in the survey form, 39.83% reported using their own custom-built or hacked 
interfaces, and 5.08% reported collaborating with someone who builds tools for them. 
For participants with disability, 66.67% used other hardware than the ones suggested 
in the survey form, 41.67% reported building customised interfaces, and 8.33%  
reported collaborating with someone who builds tools for them. 
Custom hardware mentioned by participants with disability were: an augmented 
trombone controller, the T-stick, custom hardware built by sensors and Arduino or 
Bela, hacked or circuit-bent toys, consoles, or electronic interfaces. 25% out the 
participants with disability used assistive technologies (Soundbeam, guided access 
iPad, switches, prescription glasses, colour-schemes for colour blindness,  voice 
control and text-to-speech applications). A quote from one participant regarding 
assistive technology was: “I've had my disability since birth and grown up with 
U s e  c a s e s .

technology (particularly with computers) and so I have probably adapted to the 
technology, rather than using assistive technologies.” 
Examples of commonly used MIDI controllers were Novation, Korg, and Akai. 
Examples of common modular synthesisers were Doepfer, Korg, Buchla, Serge, 
Eurorack, and Nord.  Commonly used tools were Arduino, Bela, tablets, Nintendo Wii 
motes, Leap Motion, Roli, and phones.  9 participants explicitly reported that they 
build their own custom-built gestural controllers.
Limitations and frustrations 
Out of all participants, 24.36% explicitly stated that they experienced no limitations 
and frustrations with their current setup; for participants without disability the figure 
was 21.29%, and for participants with disability it was 46.15%. Identified themes are 
presented in Tab. 1. Interestingly, 5 respondents mentioned positive aspects of 
limitations, describing them as a source of creativity.

For participants with disability, limitations that were mentioned related to 
malfunctioning hardware, need for software updates, too little time or space, lacking 
knowledge, difficulties with reading menus, lack of voice control, and the need for 
more seamless work with hardware.
Effects of COVID-19
In total, 51.69% of the participants stated that their music practice had been affected 
by COVID-19, 36.44% that they had not been affected, and 11.86% were not sure. 
Among participants with disability, 50%  reported that COVID-19 had affected their 
music-making practice, 25% that it had not, and 25% were not sure.

Negative effects 
The most frequent comment was that it has been impossible to play live and do 
performances (24 participants). Many participants (20) also mentioned not being able 
to rehearse for concerts and play or collaborate with others, thereby being forced to 
make music on your own. 9 participants described that it was harder to make music 
because of the lifestyle during the pandemic and that this had affected their creative 
process negatively.  Other mentioned effects were reduced access to facilities, e.g. 
music studios and spatialisation equipment (5), and financial difficulties due to fewer 
opportunities (4). 
Positive effects 
Interestingly, some participants mentioned positive effects. 12 participants reported 
that they had been practicing and producing more or had more time to focus on 
making music. Several commented that COVID-19 has resulted in changing practices: 
changing artistic direction, affecting the type of music you make (8); exploring new 
environments and tools (7), acquiring new skills (4), and shifting focus to online 
collaborations/performances (4). 
Imagining DMIs 
The ideal interface 
Identified themes are presented in Tab.2. (N=number of participants). Most quotes 
related to descriptions of ideal interfaces based on providing examples of existing 
interfaces. Examples of interfaces that already come close to an ideal interface were 
modular synthesisers, the Roli Seabord and Ableton Push 2. Some participants focused 
on describing combinations of, or hybrid, interfaces, e.g. “A hybrid between Pure Data 
and Wekinator.”

Another frequent theme was gestural control. For example, one participant described a 
“seamless wearable interface that could recognise complex multidimensional gestures. 
For instance intention, direction, rhythm and specific choreographed movements.” One 
participant referred to the gestural interface seen in the film Minority Report6. 
Another participant described: “Idealy [sic], it would like be a central dedicated

made interface. As so, I could use easily several custom gestural controller depending 
the mood, ideas and projects.” Moreover, one participant stated: “Not that different 
from what I use now in terms of gestural control and instrument integration, but more 
polished and accessible to control internal processes (mapping, sound synthesis, etc).” 
Many respondents stressed the need for physical interaction and haptic or tactile 
feedback. For example, one participant wrote: “I'm currently interested in higher-level 
‘compositional assistants’, so I would imagine an environment (probably a customized 
one for each piece and/or performance) where I could use a tactile and responsive 
interfaces to control many parameters of sound in real-time.”  There were also many 
comments about the need for more simple and user-friendly interfaces that could 
better support learning: “Simple and easy with different available tutorials. Being self-
taught, the worst kind of interface is the one where there are a million buttons 
everywhere which make comprehension near impossible.” Another common theme was 
having access to a large variety of synthesis tools and effects: “Infinity and divine 
inspiration. In smaller scale: an electric junkyard in a concert hall.”
Several participants questioned the idea of an ‘ideal interface’ and commented on the 
relationship between interfaces and creative compositional processes, emphasising the 
need for diversity. For example, one respondent wrote: “This is very hard to tell. 
Considering that my music practice involves an exploration to actually find the music I 
want to make (that is, I never really know it at the beginning of the creative journey), 
such an interface couldn't exist in advance, and it could only limit my possibilities. Or, 
on the contrary, exactly those limitations could become source of inspiration.” Another 
respondent wrote: “I think that constraints help in composing music, limitation is a 
kind of starting point in order to compose or explore.” A third participant stated: “It 
doesn't exist. The way I make music is playing many different instruments and 
interfaces.” 
Some described that ‘no interface’ would actually be the ideal case, or requesting 
‘invisible’ interfaces: “Invisible gestural interface with zero latency and infinite 
sampling rate of infinite points of motion on the body that 'knows' without training 
what sound you are attempting to embody/create.” Another participant described this 
as “No special tools, no electronics  gadgets weared [sic] by the user, total fredom 
[sic].” Others suggested creating music “directly from your brain”: “[…] I'd like an 
interface that can as fast as possible, with as little translation-noise as possible, take 
the clear ideas in my mind and realise them without having to ‘wait’ to show them to 
others.” Another alternative input method was through voice/singing: “Something that

13
converts voice to MIDI note data - or amplifies singing signal and layers voice with 
other textures to strengthen.” 
Additional themes included interfaces allowing for more expressive gesture control, 
augmented claviers, modular system design, assignable buttons/knobs etc.,  no latency, 
multi-parameter control, and 2D or 3D representations. For example, one participant 
mentioned: “I feel like it would be 3D where it dosen't [sic]follow a linear line left to 
right but you could dive in to the sound and time in a Z axis, if that makes any sense.” 
Imaginative uses of gestural technology
Identified themes are presented in Tab.3. The most frequent comment related to 
skepticism towards in-air controllers in terms of lack of precise control and 
tactile/haptic feedback, and references to the Theremin as a difficult instrument. One 
participant commented: “I really like having something physical to hold onto, with 
passive (or active!) physical feedback, resistance to certain motions, weight, inertia.” 
Many participants mentioned that they were not sure if in-air interaction would fit 
their current music-making practice. Others reflected on their own experiences from 
in-air controllers.  There were also some positive comments and reflections of 
successful use of in participants own practice: e.g. “I mostly use it to control the 
position of sound objects in immersive audio environments.” Another common theme 
was related to mapping in-air movements to sonic parameters, with one respondent 
describing “Timbral shifts/ other effects shifts, tempo shifts for loops, pitch shifting, 
basically anything a slider or button can do but without having to aim a finger or foot 
precisely at a tiny object away from your performing space.” Participants also 
described a range of different use cases, e.g. augmentation of acoustic instruments 
and dance.

ML and AI in imaginative interfaces   
Overall, attitudes towards the use of ML methods and AI tools were generally positive: 
31.35% participants explicitly answered that they could be useful and 6.78% were 
already using such tools. However, 15.25% participants said that they did not think 
these tools could be used, and 11.86% were not sure. Identified themes are presented 
in Tab. 4. The most common theme related to using ML and AI as tools in the 
compositional process. For example, one participant mentioned: “Yes I would love to 
have an AI that could take what I was playing and prompt me with interesting 
melodies.” Another participant suggested that such systems could be used for 
“Recognizing the patterns of neural activity on my audial cortex to record the music in 
my head.” Many other potential use cases were also mentioned, e.g. gesture 
recognition, sound generation and exploration of sonic spaces, mixing and mastering, 
as an improvisational partner, automation of time-consuming/boring tasks, habit 
detection, mapping, as a teaching/practice tool, creation of game- or popular music, 
and randomisation/pattern generation.   
Some were skeptical about the influence of ML and AI on artistic processes. For 
example, one respondent wrote that it could be used for craftmanship duties, but “[I] 
don't think it's a good idea to make an ML engine do artistical [sic] decisions.” Another

participant stated: “Spontaneously I would maybe not like an ML/AI to learn from me, 
but rather other people and present me their input.” One participant also wrote: 
“Primarily, these things are tools moreso than anything else.”
Interestingly, some commented that these tools could work as “a real time 
accompaniest/protaganist/provocateur.” For example, one participant described that “I 
think playing on my own it's easy to get stuck in the same patterns of playing, but 
when playing with someone else this rarely happens. So I think for the times when it's 
not possible to play with someone else, having an AI to somewhat mimic another 
player would be great.”

Reflections from participants with disability
The ideal interface
When it comes to imagining an ideal interface, one participant with dyspraxia and 
ADHD stated “I don't think there can be an ideal interface, other than one that you 
plug into your brain to extract music directly from it. Every other physical interface 
will be flawed in some way, or will dictate the composition/performance process.” A 
participant with ADHD mentioned that "What I really long for is a better way to make 
mappings. Software that lets me demonstrate gesture-to-sound relationships, but also 
hand patch individual associations, change transfer functions, etc." One of the 
participants with physical disability stated that "The modular synthesizer is quite close 
to ideal because it's possible for my to do some things in real-time, but also to shift 
some of the other control to automated (e.g. sequenced) processes - and this 
combination of real-time interaction and prior-set automated elements is really useful 
for one-handed interaction (I can also use the thumb on my left elbow and so perhaps 
1.6 handed interaction! (…)) - the ideal additions would probably be being able to 
easily visualise the signal at every point, so that it's clear what's going on and 
parameters can be set precisely and more quickly.” Another participant with a physical 
disability described an imagined ideal interface as “A book to draw pictures and write 
music with words and patterns, different colors and cut holes to make pages layer 
together as pictures. Maybe a pair of gloves that could play the music as a blind man is 
reading, with the fingertips.” One participant who reported being partially sighted 
described that the ideal interface does not exist. A participant with ADHD and autism 
mentioned that the ideal interface for her would involve gamification for learning; 
‘“Instead of explanations under the help section, I would prefer quizzes and games to 
help me finding my way in the programme. This would be step 1. Step 2 would be a 
game like Simon Says, where I follow the computer in recreating an existing track of 
my choice, step-by-step, and through this learn/establish A) where to quickly find the 
different sounds and B) where to quickly find the different ways to process/manipulate 
the sounds.“ 
Imaginative uses of gestural technology
In general, few of the participants were positive about gestural technology. The 
positive remarks related to their potential in live performances or as a conducting tool 
in VR, and a possible replicate of the Bernard Szajner laser harp. One participant with 
dyspraxia and ADHD made the following statement about gestural in-air controllers: 
“Not particularly useful for me, my dyspraxia means I tend to stay away from musical

17
interfaces that require a lot of dexterity.” Another participant with physical disability 
mentioned, “I have used gestural, in-air controllers in the past and agree they're useful 
for certain things - e.g. 'free'/unquantised expression, but the lack of haptic feedback 
makes them difficult to use precisely (at least for me).”
ML and AI in imaginative interfaces   
Most of the participants (8) were positive about using ML and AI in their practice. One 
participant with ADHD mentioned that “ML/AI are great tools for making mappings,” 
and described using Wekinator as part of his practice.  However, he also described that 
“The problem is making adjustments to the learned models after training. Everything 
is a black box, and it can be difficult to make small tweaks when all you can do to 
change the model is indirect (changing the training data).” One of the participants 
with physical disability noted that more user or artist-friendly ML environments, i.e. 
environments that are easily integrated into Max, Pd, SC etcetera, would be useful. 
One participant with ADHD mentioned that AI and ML could be used for “creating a 
collaborative partner to play music with, who can learn to adapt their behaviours like a 
human collaborator would.”  Other comments that were made focused on the potential 
of AI and ML as tools used in composition processes, for example by “learning to 
imitate […] methods, and then function as a tool for composition” and “create[ing] new 
versions of a group of compositions.” Yet another suggestion involved having the 
system learn actions that are repeated a lot of times in music production: “I probably 
do the same things a lot when i produce. like putting a specific series of plug-ins in a 
certain order etc on x tope of sound/instrument. so an AI could probably help me 
suggest stuff that it learned I like.” Other participants also considered ML great for the 
more ‘mundane’ tasks involved in music-making, such as categorising sounds and 
mastering final mixes. Finally, one participant described that AI and ML could be used 
for “detecting my weak spots and create games/quizzes that focus on making them 
stronger.“
Discussion
In this study, we invited electronic music-makers of varying experiences to reflect on 
their practice and setup and to imagine and describe an ideal interface for music-
making. Respondents described several frustrations of their current setups, e.g. 
software and hardware limitations, time-consuming processes, need for more or new 
interfaces, and physical space requirements for the gear.

Qualitative analysis of open-ended questions suggested that an imagined ideal 
interface may consist of combinations and hybrids of existing interfaces and gestural 
controls/sensors, that it should provide haptic feedback and be user-friendly/support 
learning, and provide a large variety of sounds/effects.  Participants also commented 
that the ideal interface might correspond to ‘no interface’,  be seamless and invisible, 
or involve creating music directly from your brain, and provide total freedom. 
Moreover, some questioned that an ideal interface could actually exist, emphasising 
that limitations may also result in positive creative outputs. 
When it comes to the imagined use of gestural technologies, we observed that a lack of 
haptic or tactile response was a major deterrence from gestural controllers both for 
participants with and without disabilities. However, potential successful use cases for 
such technologies were also mentioned, e.g. in dance or augmentations of acoustic 
instruments.
Overall, we observed generally positive attitudes to ML/AI as tools in composition 
processes. Some mentioned that ML/AI could be interesting for exploration of sonic 
spaces and mappings for sound synthesis or as an improvisational partner to play 
with. However, others thought that these tools could or should not be used in 
electronic music-making, especially when it comes to artistic decisions. Suggestions 
for more appropriate applications for these tools were gesture recognition, mixing and 
mastering, automation of time consuming or boring tasks, and detecting habits. 
Overall, we did not observe any large differences between the envisioned ideal 
interface for participants with versus without disability. Interestingly, the survey 
revealed that 46.15% of the persons living with a disability did not experience 
limitations or frustrations with their current setup. The corresponding figure for 
persons who did not identify as living with a disability was 21.29%. These results could 
perhaps be explained by the fact that we only had 12 participants with a disability or 
access requirement. Perhaps it is not primarily the technology that is limiting in these 
contexts, but rather social aspects related to music-making (as previously shown in 
[1]). As highlighted in the quote by one of the participants with disability, there might 
be a tendency for musicians with disability to adapt to their chosen instrument. 
However, further research with a larger number of participants with disability is 
required to draw any general conclusions in this regard.

Conclusion and Future Work 
This work highlights a number of potential areas of improvement when it comes to 
tools for electronic music-making through analysis of reflections on desired properties 
of an imagined ‘ideal’ interface, collected from a total of 118 electronic musicians. 
Suggestions for imagined ideal interfaces included hybrid setups of many existing 
gestural controls, sensors, and interfaces that provide haptic feedback; are user 
friendly and support learning; enable the creation of a large variety of different 
sounds, and allow for expressive gesture control.  We also observed that electronic 
music-makers were generally positive about incorporating ML/AI tools in their music-
making practice, mainly as tools that support compositional processes. Future work 
within this domain should include a larger and more geographically diverse set of 
music-makers with disability, and in-depth interviews with those music-makers, to 
inform the design of future ADMIs.
