ABSTRACT
When performing with new instruments, musicians often
develop new performative gestures and playing techniques.
Music performance studies on new instruments often con-
sider interfaces that feature a spectrum of gestures similar
to already existing sound production techniques. This pa-
per considers the choices performers make when creating
an idiomatic gestural language for an entirely unfamiliar
instrument. We designed a musical interface with a unique
large-scale layout to encourage new performers to create
fully original instrument-body interactions. We conducted
a study where trained musicians were invited to perform one
of two versions of the same instrument, each physically iden-
tical but with a diﬀerent tone mapping. The study results
reveal insights into how musicians develop novel perfor-
mance gestures when encountering a new instrument char-
acterised by an unfamiliar shape and size. Our discussion
highlights the impact of an instrument’s scale and layout
on the emergence of new gestural vocabularies and on the
qualities of the music performed.

1. INTRODUCTION
Every year an inﬂux of new digital musical instruments
(DMIs) is created. Commercially, existing digital instru-
ments are reissued ever smaller, requiring performance ges-
tures that are familiar but equally scaled down. Artisti-
cally, entirely novel instruments are created that explore
new realms of materiality and require original, even eccen-
tric, performance gestures. However, with so many options
available, how do instrument designers know if just because
we can, we should? Are design choices such as size, shape,
materiality, tonal layout and sound design inﬂuencing the
music created on a new instrument in ways we had not
imagined? And if so, how do we ﬁnd out? We hypothesize

that the answer can be found in the performances created
on new instruments.
To test this hypothesis, we conducted a study in which
trained musicians explored and improvised on a new DMI
that is unfamiliar in as many ways as possible, with distinc-
tive size, materiality, sound-creating gestural language and
sound design. The results are discussed and contextualized
to argue that not only do design features substantially in-
ﬂuence the performances created on the instrument, they
go as far as to inﬂuence the perception of the performer.
2. RELA TED WORK
Musical gesture is deﬁned by Miranda and Wanderley as
“any human action used to generate sounds” and includes
actions such as “grasping, manipulation, and noncontact
movements, as well as to general voluntary body move-
ments” [17, p. 5]. Musical gestures that are well suited
for an instrument so as to feel natural are often called “id-
iomatic” [4]. Tanaka points out that “the lack of history
that new instruments enjoy means that what is idiomatic
has not yet been deﬁned” [14]. Tahiro˘ glu et al. surveyed
the emergence of idiomatic gestures of a range of DMIs and
argue that composing from the basis of idiomatic gestures
results in performances rich in style and meaning, the very
foundations of valued musical repertoire [13].
While musicians may think when performing an instru-
ment they have full agency over their gestural and compo-
sitional decisions, the very existence of idiomatic gestures
reveals there is more at play. At a granular level, the frame-
work of idiomatic theory helps explain how an instrument’s
aﬀordances govern the development of players’ gestural lan-
guages resulting in music idiomatic to that instrument, that
is “distinctive musical dialects made of seemingly prefabri-
cated patterns” [2].
Digital, and indeed all, instruments contain values and
scripts that tell us what music can and should be made with
them [7]. The music on oﬀer is a result of a combination
of the instrument’s aﬀordances and cultural knowledge [8].
Visi et al. explored cultural inﬂuence on gestural language
ﬁnding that musicians without violin training asked to mime
along to a recorded musical performance using a silent violin
resulted in similar performances [16].
Tuuri et al. argue that while gesture functions as an in-
strument of control (‘instrumental control’), the interface
design contributes towards ‘experiential control’ in which
the user feels their tacit bodily movement is constrained
by an interface (‘push’ eﬀects) or the interface enables their
tacit and spontaneous engagement (‘pull’ eﬀects)[15]. ‘Push’
and ‘pull’ eﬀects have been observed to inﬂuence DMI per-
formance technique showing that performers optimise their
gestures to correspond with the sensing modalities of the
instrument [5]. Musicians playing non-functional mock-up
instruments will alter their gestures and imagined sound of

Bin et al. explore the impact of instrument size on per-
ception from an audience perspective [1], however more re-
search is required from the performer’s perspective to fully
understand the impact of size, tonal layout and sound de-
sign on the music and performances created using DMIs.
3. METHODOLOGY
We conducted a study in which we monitored classically
trained musicians interacting with one of two versions (Ver-
sions A and B) of a new large-scale DMI (Figure 1). Both
versions are identical in physical construction and sonic af-
fordances but feature diﬀerent tone mapping (Figure 2).
The participants completed three musical tasks. During
Tasks 1 and 2 the instrument was turned oﬀ, requiring the
participants to mime their performances. During Task 3
the instrument was on and ampliﬁed through a PA.
3.1 Instrument design
3.1.1 Physical construction
The instrument is two metres wide and two metres high.
It is constructed from PVC pipes and PVC pipe connec-
tors. It features 20 identical pendulums. Each pendulum
Figure 3: Close-up of pendulums, 50 centimetres
long, with ten raised rings at one centimetre spac-
ing.
is 50 centimetres in length with 10 raised rings spaced one
centimetre apart that form textural ridges (Figure 3). The
pendulums are located on two tiers (an upper tier and a
lower tier), separated by a support beam so as to create
four quadrants of ﬁve pendulums. Each pendulum features
an embedded analog accelerometer. The 20 total accelerom-
eters are connected to the analog inputs of three Bela Minis
[9] (as each Bela Mini can accept a maximum of eight analog
inputs). Each Bela Mini runs Pure Data code that soniﬁes
the accelerometer signal and the resulting audio is output
via three audio cables (one per Bela Mini) to a PA.
Each pendulum was assigned a discrete tone featuring
harmonics with a fundamental frequency ranging from 55
Hertz to 1046.5 Hertz (Table 1). On higher pitched tones
the harmonics resulted in an electric guitar tone with a bell-
like timbre and on lower pitched tones the timbre was sim-
ilar to an electric bass guitar. A discordant cacophony of
tones is achievable by interacting with the pendulums or
instrument frame in such a way that the frame will vibrate.

ured to have a natural analog bandwidth of approximately
1kHz with a ﬁrst order roll oﬀ. In the Pure Data code,

forwards-backwards angle of the pendulum motion) excites
a Karplus-Strong algorithm, based on open source Pure
Data code created by Neupert et al. [6, 10]. The code
is conﬁgured such that a brighter tone is created by strik-
ing a pendulum with more force, and a tone with longer
sustain is created by striking a pendulum while holding it
at an angle up to ninety degrees, the maximum aﬀorded by
the physical construction.
3.2 Study design
The study was a structured one-to-one interview-based study.
The interviews lasted one hour each, during which time the
trained musicians were introduced to the new instrument
for the ﬁrst time and given musical tasks to perform on the
instrument. After each task the participants were asked to
elaborate on the choices they made while completing the
tasks. The interviews and musical tasks were recorded with
video cameras from multiple angles.
3.2.1 P articipants
We recruited ten participants, of whom seven were trained
pianists, ﬁve were trained percussionists and ﬁve were trained
guitarists (Table 2). An equal number of percussionists and
keyboard players were assigned each version of the study
instrument. Participants’ ages ranged from 25 to 69 with
an average of 38 years old. The average years of lessons
they had received on their primary instrument was eight
years for keyboardists, three years for percussionists and
two years for guitarists. While all participants were literate
in western notation, their primary musical styles varied.
3.2.2 Musical tasks
The participants used the new instrument to complete three
musical tasks. In Task 1, the instrument remained turned
oﬀ for the duration of the task. The participant was given
ﬁve minutes to explore the instrument, perform gestures and
imagine the resulting sounds. They were told to perform a
one-minute mimed improvised performance while imagining
the sound of the instrument. In Task 2, the invigilator per-
formed the instrument without the participant watching, so
the participant could be aware of the range of tones and tim-
bres the instrument is capable of producing. Participants
were again encouraged to silently explore the instrument for
ﬁve minutes in its turned oﬀ state, and mime a one-minute
improvised performance, however this time with knowledge
of the instrument’s sound design. In Task 3, the instrument
was turned on. The participant explored the instrument for
ﬁve minutes and created a one-minute improvisation.
The video recordings were manually transcribed and the
transcription data was analyzed following a thematic anal-
ysis methodology [3]. Codes emerged through a theory-
driven iterative process [12], in that the raw interview data
was examined for trends and correlations that relate to the
theories of idiomatic gestural language and experiential con-
trol. Four iterations of coding were performed resulting in
a codebook that was updated and reﬁned at each coding
iteration. The video recordings of the improvised perfor-
mances were analysed for performative trends by identifying
gestures and patterns participants performed in each task.
4. FINDINGS
The themes revealed trends across participants, regardless
of their musical background and which instrument version
they performed.
4.1 Imagined sound design of the instrument
Task 1 required the participants to mime performance on
the instrument without knowledge of the digital sounds it
makes, and in doing so imagine its sonic aﬀordances. During
this task several participants conceptualised similar sound
design for the instrument. Seven of the ten participants
imagined the DMI to sound like a metal tuned percussion in-
strument, with several each referring to bells, wind chimes,
xylophone and vibraphone. One participant, P4, chose to
not imagine tones at all and only perform the instrument
with knowledge of their own rhythmic input so that no mat-
ter what sounds the instrument makes the resulting music
could at least be rhythmically coherent. Even so, he said he
initially thought the DMI might sound like a bell until he re-
alised the instrument is not made of metal, only painted to
look that way. Four participants imagined sounds inspired
by wind moving through pipes, and one imagined sound
design of metal scraping on metal, such as the sound of a
squeaky gate. Two participants imagined percussive tones
reminiscent of a g¨uiro. Four participants imagined ambient,
soundscape or found sound samples.
Three participants imagined a deep bass tone. P7, a pi-
anist, imagined the instrument to sound like a piano but
no participants imagined the instrument to sound like a
guitar. Upon hearing the DMI only one participant, P10,
commented that the instrument featured a tone they had
imagined, saying “I was really gratiﬁed that this had within
it that kind of dark tone that I was hoping to hear... I was
right in imagining this was a sci-ﬁ instrument.”
4.2 Familiarity of instrument
When commenting on the sound of the DMI and how it
compares to other instruments, six participants said it has
features reminiscent of tuned percussion instruments such
as melodic drums, thumb piano, cymbals, bells or tubular
bells, and seven participants commented it has some sound
design features similar to a string or extended string instru-
ment such as an electric guitar, sitar, saz, prepared piano
or prepared harp. Six participants said the DMI is unlike
any other instrument they have ever performed. Common
reasons for its distinctiveness are that it is performed in a
physical, percussive manner but has the detailed sonic aﬀor-

dances of an electric string instrument. P10 said the raised
rings on the pendulums are like the coils of a guitar string if
the guitar string was enlarged to the size of the pendulum.
4.3 T onal layout of the instrument
During the ﬁrst two tasks, all participants imagined that
each pendulum has a unique tone and the tones are ar-
ranged in a predictable order. Two participants imagined
the tones ascend to form a pentatonic scale, two imagined
a chromatic scale and two imagined a scale neither penta-
tonic nor chromatic. Three participants imagined the tones
to be ordered with the lowest tones in the centre and high-
est tones on the outside, inspired by the tuning layout of
the metal tine instrument the mbira. During the ﬁnal task
when the instrument was turned on, ﬁve participants cor-
rectly identiﬁed that the lowest tones are located on the left
and the highest tones on the right, however no participants
identiﬁed the exact pattern of tonal ascension. Six partic-
ipants commented that they found the pitches to be in an
unexpected or confusing order.
Visually, the instrument frame creates an aesthetic of two
tiers separated into four quadrants containing ﬁve pendu-
lums each. While discussing the tonal layout of the instru-
ment, eight of the ten participants referred to the tiers and
nine of the ten participants referred to the quadrants in
comments that revealed they assigned signiﬁcance of the
tiers and quadrants to the instrument’s tonal layout. Dur-
ing the mimed tasks, four participants imagined lower tones
located on the lower tier and higher tones located on the
upper tier, while ﬁve participants imagined diﬀerent tones
and/or timbres to be located on each tier but not necessar-
ily the low tones on the lower tier and the higher tones on
the upper tier. Five participants imagined each quadrant
features a diﬀerent register or range of tones, and one par-
ticipant (P9) imagined each quadrant features a diﬀerent
instrument such as a sampler in one quadrant and a synth
in another quadrant.
After Task 3, P3 said he performing the central upper tier
pendulums because he like the pitch range there. Similarly,
P10 was particularly drawn to a certain quadrant because
it has a “Turkish saz vibe” and a range similar to an elec-
tric guitar. P10 commented that pendulums in a particular
quadrant “made really outrageous noises” and “seemed so
much less melodic” than pendulums in other quadrants. ” I
was trying to create a groove and I thought those (pendu-
lums) are going to disrupt that” . Both P3 and P10 per-
formed Version B.
P5 and P8, who performed Version B and Version A re-
spectively, both commented that they don’t think the order
of the tones in the quadrants on the left follow on to the
quadrants on the right, implying that the central support
beam signiﬁes a discontinuation of the tonal layout. In all,
six of the participants referred to the quadrants as a way of
describing groups of tones. The reality is the tones ascend
in order irrespective of the quadrants.
4.4 Playing techniques
Table 3 shows emergent playing techniques and how many
participants performed each technique per task. Notably,
striking the instrument with the soft end of the mallet was
performed by all 10 participants. Six other gestures were
performed by ﬁve or more participants, including striking
the instrument frame (8 participants), scraping the hard end
of the mallet over the pendulum rings (7 participants) and
striking with the hard end of the mallet (7 participants).
With each task the participants expanded their gestural
languages. In Task 1, by default all ten participants per-
formed gestures they had not performed before. In Task 2
and again in 3, seven out of ten participants performed a
new gesture they had not previously performed. It is to be
expected that participants would discover new gestures in
Task 3 as a result of the sound being on, and ﬁve partici-
pants reported knowingly doing so. We ﬁnd it interesting
that two participants, P6 and P7, developed new gestures
during Task 2 after discovering the instrument is capable of
creating more timbres than they had originally imagined.

each gesture in Tasks 1, 2, 3 and all tasks combined.

Table 4 shows the number of pendulums each performer
played per task. We ﬁnd it interesting that each participant
performed on average 18, 16 and 19 pendulums during Task
1, 2, and 3 respectively, making almost full use of the 20
tones on oﬀer regardless of whether the sound was on.
In addition to trends of sound producing gestures, trends
of compositional patterns emerged in which participants
were observed to perform the same combination of tones in
series. Table 5 shows the patterns that participants were ob-
served to play, and how many participants performed each
pattern per task. All ten participants performed at least
one of these patterns during each task.
Five of the patterns ( “quadrant in order” , “adjacent quad-
rant patterns” , “quadrant sweep” , “simultaneous or alternat-
ing neighbours” and “tier in order” ) were performed by par-
ticipants on both versions of the instrument during Task
3 with the sound on, thereby resulting in diﬀerent sonic
output. The most performed patterns are achievable with

many notes performed in order with the one arm gesture.
By contrast, the least frequently observed pattern was the
most diﬃcult to perform ( “furthermost stretch” ).
4.5 Physicality of the instrument in relation-
ship to the performer’s body
Five participants remarked on how large the instrument is,
saying “it’s easily the biggest instrument I’ve ever played”
(P3) and “I can’t believe how large it is, and I think that
could be slightly intimidating” (P6). Two of the partic-
ipants commented on its potential to be dangerous, with
P2 demonstrating “if it’s swinging like this you have to be
careful it doesn’t hit you in the face” .
Three participants commented that they chose to perform
pendulums that were more ergonomically suited to their
body. Five participants said they relocated themselves to a
diﬀerent part of the instrument to perform pendulums that
were in their preferred tonal range.
Seven out of ten participants consistently performed from
outside the instrument’s frame (Table 6). Of these partic-
ipants, three performed only ever facing the pendulums,
without exploring the side or back of the instrument.
Table 6: Number of participants who performed
from each location per task.
Performer location Task 1 Task 2 Task 3
Outside frame, facing pendulums 8 7 7
Inside frame, facing pendulums 5 3 3
Left, right and/or behind frame 3 1 2
Three participants chose to perform all tasks from in-
side the instrument’s frame (Figure 4) with one (P8) not
even exploring the options of performing from any other
location. All three complained that the instrument design
features horizontal support beam dividing the left and right
sides of the instrument, restricting their access to each side
as they would need to duck below it to cross the divide.
This resulted in them either focusing their improvisations
on one half of the instrument, or choreographing ducking
movements into their performance. Ironically if they had
chosen to perform from the outside of the instrument they
would not have been restricted by the support beam.
5. DISCUSSION
It is evident that the instrument’s materiality, aesthetics
and sound design inﬂuence the emergent gestural language
and in turn the initial music improvised on the instrument.
5.1 Impact of materiality on imagined sound
When imagining the DMI’s sound, nine of the ten partici-
pants were inﬂuenced by the instrument’s materiality such
as the pendulum rings that brought to mind g¨uiro-inspired
sounds and the metallic aesthetic that evoked sounds and
tonal layouts of metallic instruments. These results rein-
force Pigrem et al.’s ﬁndings that performers’ expectations
Figure 4: Three participants performed all tasks
from inside the frame even though this restricted
access to the other side of the instrument.
of a DMI’s sound and function are fundamentally linked to
their tacit and cultural knowledge of materiality [11].
5.2 Impact of sound design on development
of gestural language
Participants discussed ways in which the sound design inﬂu-
enced their methods for developing performance gestures.
P3 and P5 discussed abandoning previous gestures when
they discovered they did not result in sound. P2 described
changing to easier techniques that result in the same sound.
For instance, when he discovered the swing of a pendulum
does not change its tone he left pendulums swinging, when
previously he tried to stop each pendulum. P4 and P10
both described their techniques as trying every gesture then
focusing on those that result in sound, “eliminating move-
ments that are not useful, and trying to ﬁnd the ones that
were” (P10). With the sound on, P10 played with more pre-
cision and variation, explaining “I was testing much more
subtle kind of movements, when originally I thought they
might just make one sound but it seems that they’re more
interactive with velocity” . These comments illustrate Jack
et al.’s research into musicians optimising their gestures to
match the sensing modalities of instruments [5].
5.3 Impact of sound design on improvisation
In Task 1, P8 imagined the instrument’s tones would sus-
tain so she performed gestures at a slow tempo. In Task 2,
after hearing the shorter-than-expected instrument tones,
her gestures sped up. She said her decision to increase the
tempo was based on a preference for tones to ﬁnish before

574
new ones begin. This demonstrates how an instrument’s
sound design can impose ‘pull’ eﬀects that control the per-
former to change the speed of their performance.
5.4 Impact of instrument physicality on com-
positional choices
P6 commented that she was unsure whether she played a
pendulum because she likes its tone or whether she likes its
tone because it is in an ergonomically convenient location.
Meanwhile, P8 justiﬁed moving around the instrument a
lot by saying “you’ve got this big machine, you don’t want
to just stay there. You want to... use the breadth of the
machine” . These examples illustrate Tuuri et al.’s research
on experiential control [15] as the physical size of the in-
strument in relationship to the performer’s body results in
‘pull’ eﬀects that control which pendulums the performer
plays and in turn how they move their body.
5.4.1 Impact of tonal layout on improvisation choices
Identical patterns of successive tones were observed to be
performed by diﬀerent participants. As these compositional
patterns were performed on both instrument versions re-
gardless of tonal layout, therefore resulting in diﬀerent sonic
output, we propose to identify them as the instrument’s id-
iomatic gestural patterns.
Patterns occurring across more than one quadrant more
frequently combined quadrants located above or below rather
than beside one another. Performing quadrants side by side
requires much more movement than performing quadrants
above one another. This trend indicates that what is id-
iomatic to this instrument has less to do with sound design
and more to do with the instrument’s physical layout and
its relationship to the body.
Beyond inﬂuencing emergent idiomatic patterns, the vi-
sual aesthetic of the quadrants even inﬂuenced the per-
former’s perception of the tones themselves. This is illus-
trated by the examples of the participants that performed
Version B of the instrument who were drawn to certain
quadrants and avoided others. Version B features a zigzag
tonal layout such that the upper and lower tiers have a sim-
ilar range of pitches and timbres.
6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
While there is an inﬂuence of sound design on performance
techniques, the idiomatic gestures and patterns that emerged
seem to be strongly dependant on the relationship between
the instrument’s physical layout (a combination of the tonal
layout and size) and the human body, resulting in strong in-
ﬂuence on the improvisations created and moreover even re-
sulting in musicians changing their perception of the sound.
In this paper we have introduced a study that observed
the initial reactions of trained musicians when encountering
a new, unfamiliar, large scale DMI for the ﬁrst time. The
study resulted in the identiﬁcation of several idiomatic ges-
tures and idiomatic patterns of the instrument as well as
new insights into how the layout, materiality, sound design
and size of an instrument govern performance choices. The
study revealed that sound design inﬂuences both idiomatic
gestures and idiomatic patterns, yet some idiomatic pat-
terns are so inherent to an instrument that if disrupted by
replacing tones with other tones, musicians perform the id-
iomatic patterns regardless of the tones and even perceive
the tones diﬀerently which in turn inﬂuences their use in
performance. These ﬁndings illuminate how the size and
layout of a DMI inﬂuence the instrument’s idiomatic ges-
tures and idiomatic patterns, which in turn inﬂuence per-
formances created on the instrument.
