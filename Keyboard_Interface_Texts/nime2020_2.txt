ABSTRACT
Excello is a spreadsheet-based music composition and pro-
gramming environment. We co-developed Excello with
feedback from 21 musicians at varying levels of musical and
computing experience. We asked: can the spreadsheet in-
terface be used for programmatic music creation? Our de-
sign process encountered questions such as how time should
be represented, whether amplitude and octave should be en-
coded as properties of individual notes or entire phrases, and
how best to leverage standard spreadsheet features, such as
formulae and copy-paste.
We present the user-centric rationale for our current de-
sign, and report a user study suggesting that Excello’s no-
tation retains similar cognitive dimensions to conventional
music composition tools, while allowing the user to write
substantially complex programmatic music.

1. INTRODUCTION
Programmatic environments for music creation, such as
ChucK [15] or Sonic Pi [1], enable the creation of complex
and dynamic compositions with rich and interactive feed-
back. However, these systems are extremely hard to learn,
especially for users new to programming.
On the other hand, spreadsheets are a well-known and
easy to learn programming environment. The 2-dimensional
grid, along with support for computation, annotation, and
visualization, forms the basis for the world’s most ubiqui-
tous non-expert end-user programming environment. There
are four times more spreadsheet users than software devel-
opers [14], and spreadsheets are the preferred programming

language for many people [9]. This ubiquity, along with the
aﬀordances of the spreadsheet, enables new ways to interact
with musical notation that capitalise on existing familiarity
with spreadsheets and their data handling capabilities.
We present Excello (Fig. 1, shown here in use with a study
participant’s arrangement), an Excel add-in for end-user
music programming. The Excello add-in opens a pane on
the right side of Excel. The user deﬁnes notes and ‘turtles’
in the cells of the spreadsheet. Turtles are programmable
playheads that move through the grid using a simple in-
struction language. Notes in cells are played when turtles
move through them. When the play button is pressed, the
melodic lines deﬁned by all turtles are played simultane-
ously (by default using a sampled piano sound).
2. EXCELLO’S DESIGN
2.1 Design process
Excello’s design is grounded in concrete user needs and feed-
back. Twenty-one University of Cambridge students, across
a range of subjects, took part in the participatory design
process. We conducted initial feedback sessions as follows:
one-on-one tutorials on the initial prototype were given, fol-
lowed by a short exercise of the participant’s choice; either
transcribing a piece from memory or from staﬀ notation
into the Excello notation, or modifying and extending a
composition already written in Excello. Next, users were
interviewed about their experience, drawing particular at-
tention to actions that they found unintuitive or requiring
notable mental eﬀort. Comparisons were made to musical
interfaces with which participants were already familiar.
These sessions were conducted in January 2019. Partici-
pants continued using Excello for the next 7-8 weeks, until
the summative evaluation sessions in March, ensuring that
the evaluation was conducted on participants with signif-
icant experience using Excello. Additional feedback was
collected as participants used Excello in their own time.
In the next section, we explain and describe some of the
interesting and important design issues that arose in con-
sultation with our participants.
2.2 Abstracting time with turtles
The spreadsheet’s chief advantage is its 2-dimensional grid,
which allows the end-user to spatially organise their com-
putations and data. Many music composition environments
also use grid structure, albeit in a limited fashion. For ex-
ample, MIDI sequencers [8] typically use the horizontal axis
for time, and the vertical axis for pitch or musical parts.
Manhattan [12] uses a grid where formulae can deﬁne a

cell’s value, like in a spreadsheet. However, it is limited
to columns deﬁning tracks and rows corresponding to time.
Similarly, other spreadsheet music projects1 only use the
spreadsheet grid with the conventional sequencing layout,
sacriﬁcing the ﬂexibility of using both grid axes.
SheetMusic [13] was the ﬁrst investigation of formulae
with sound output within the spreadsheet paradigm. Sheet-
Music abstracts time away from the grid using an incre-
menting globaltick variable which could be referred to in
formulae. Both axes can be used interchangeably for Sheet-
Music notation or non-musical markup (e.g., data, labels,
formatting), a concept idiomatic to spreadsheets. Music is
notated with formulae such as:if(tick%2==0) p(‘snare’)
else p(‘kick’), which plays an alternating snare and kick
sound. However, such formulae quickly become unwieldy
for larger pieces, especially if they are not highly repetitive.
How do we compactly represent time without sacriﬁcing
a grid axis? To solve this problem, we apply the metaphor
of turtle graphics [5]. In the Logo programming language,
agents known as ‘turtles’ are programmed to produce graph-
ical output: e.g.,repeat 4 [forward 5 right 90] has a
turtle move forwards 5 units and turn right 90 degrees, to-
gether repeated four times, to draw a square.
The turtle abstraction is employed by Excello by deﬁning
notes in cells, and agents, known as turtles, move through
the spreadsheet playing them. Al-Jazari [10] also uses the
turtle metaphor, albeit in a limited fashion. In Al-Jazari,
robotic agents navigate around a two-dimensional grid. Dis-
tance in space maps to time [11]. Excello extends this, as
turtles can move at diﬀerent speeds. Therefore parts with
varying speeds, and phase music (where identical parts are
played concurrently at diﬀerent speeds) can be deﬁned more
concisely. Moreover, Al-Jazari’s agents are programmed

never-mind-the-sheet-music-heres-spreadsheet-music/
with movement symbols in thought bubbles above them.
This is unlike spreadsheets where both data and compu-
tation logic exist in the same grid. Al-Jazari’s grid only
measures ten cells wide and long, which greatly simpliﬁes
and constrains agents’ movements.
2.3 Encoding musical notes
Notesare written using scientiﬁc pitch notation (SPN); e.g.
F#4 is the F� above middle C. Empty cells and the full stop
character (.) denote rests. The character s or - instructs
the turtle to sustain the previously played note, and a cell
can be subdivided using commas into multiple equal length
notes (Figure 2). The combination of sustains and subdi-
visions allows the composer to choose the most convenient
note duration to correspond to each cell. Without subdi-
vision, a piece deﬁned primarily with crotchets (one unit)
but with occasional quavers (half a unit) would need twice
as many cells and many additionals cells.
Figure 2: Two identical phrases, deﬁned (above) by using
sustains or (below) with subdivided cells.
Octave numbers can be omitted for brevity; during
testing we discovered that repeatedly writing the octave
number was tiresome. If omitted, we use the last explic-
itly notated octave encountered by the turtle. We tested
two methods for octave inference: playing the note insame
octave as the previous note, or choosing the octave in which
the note would benearest to the previous note. Both
have advantages and disadvantages. The nearest-octave ap-
proach may require fewer explicit statements of octave num-

bers, but it is harder for a reader to immediately identify
the octave of any given note; they would need to locate the
last explicit octave notation and walk through subsequent
notes, keeping track of the inferred octave. The same-octave
approach may require many octave deﬁnitions if a melody
frequently crosses the boundary between octaves, but it is
much easier for the reader to identify the octave of a note by
backtracking, and this was the trade-oﬀ our users preferred.
Dynamics Just as dynamics in western notation are a
property of the staﬀ, not of individual notes, dynamics were
originally deﬁned in the turtle, not in notes, using the sym-
bols pp p mp mf f ff (etc.) next to turtle movement com-
mands. However, users found that dynamics, being un-
related to movement, made it harder to read the turtle’s
path. Furthermore, as dynamics weren’t next to the notes
to which they corresponded, knowing the volume of a note
or where to place the dynamics within the turtle to apply
to notes in the spreadsheet was challenging.
Thus, we settled on dynamics being deﬁned in the cells
after the note, separated by a space as in Manhattan [12].
In addition to Western dynamic symbols, a number between
0 (silent) and 1 (equivalent tofff) can be used. Like oc-
tave numbers (and indeed, like staﬀ notation), a dynamics
speciﬁcation applies to all following notes until the turtle en-
counters another explicit speciﬁcation. Table 1 summarises
our note encoding.
2.4 Encoding the turtle’s path
The following formula-like syntax deﬁnes a turtle:
!turtle(Start_Cell, Instructions, Tempo, Loops)
The preﬁx “!” signals that the turtle is active; omitting this
preﬁx causes the turtle not to play, analogous to muting and
soloing in digital audio workstations / music sequencers.
Instead of typing this text directly, the user can also de-
ﬁne a turtle using the formula function EXCELLO.TURTLE,
enabling users to leverage the built-in autocompletion and
cell referencing features of Excel. The output of this func-
tion is our textual turtle notation (Figure 4).
Figure 3: A short melody in an early prototype (above)
with its output in staﬀ notation (below).
Figure 4: Deﬁning a turtle usingEXCELLO.TURTLE.
Start Cell The turtle’s starting cell (A2 in Figure 3),
which is also played, is a cell reference (a concatenation of
letters for the column and numbers for the row). As each
turtle only plays one note at a time, multiple turtles must
be deﬁned for polyphony. A common user pattern was to
deﬁne turtles following identical paths but in adjacent rows
or columns. To simplify this process, we made it possible
to instantiate multiple turtles using Excel’s range notation.
Setting the starting cell toA2:A5 deﬁnes four turtles in the
cells A2,A3,A4,A5. This removes the need for multiple turtle
deﬁnitions diﬀering in only the start cell.
Tempo An optional third argument is the speed of the
turtle in cells per minute (the default is 160). An early
implementation required this as a multiplier for 160 (thus
1 corresponded to 160 cells per minute, 0.5 corresponded
to 80 cells per minute, etc.), so that it would be easier to
tell the speed relation between turtles. This particularly
suits phase music. However, participants felt calculating
this speed factor was eﬀortful and unnatural so we switched
to cells per minute. Luckily, in a spreadsheet environment,
it is still straightforward to implement relative tempi using
formulae: turtles could reference a single cell containing a
‘base’ speed, and apply a turtle-speciﬁc multiplier.
Loops An optional fourth argument deﬁnes the number
of repetitions of the turtle’s entire path (e.g., the turtle in
Figure 3 plays 1 time). By default, turtles loop inﬁnitely.
Turtle motion Turtles begin facing north (towards the
top of the screen). Like Logo, turtles always move in the
direction they are facing. The commandsl and r turn the
turtle 90 degrees left and right respectively, and commands
n, e, s and w directly re-orient the turtle north, east, south
and west. The commandm moves the turtle one cell forward.
Commands are repeated by placing a number immediately
after it (this is less verbose than Logo’s notation:repeat
followed by the number of repeats and the commands [5]).
Thus,m4 moves the turtle forwards four cells in the direc-
tion it faces. Commands can be nested within parentheses,
and nested commands can be repeated. Thus,(r m5)4 de-
ﬁnes a clockwise path around aﬁve-by-ﬁve square. Nested
instructions with repeats allow concise notation of repeated
sections and movements.
Just as conventional staﬀ notation spans multiple lines,
splitting melodies into parts spanning multiple rows is a
useful layout for human readers. This requires the tur-
tle to move to non-adjacent cells. In Logo, lifting the
pen allows the turtle to move without drawing a line; the
graphical output is unaﬀected by the turtle’s path in ‘pen-
up’ mode. However, Excello’s musical output depends on
the turtles’ movements in time, so a ‘pen-up/pen-down’
metaphor would introduce large rests as the turtle moved to
its destination. Thus, our language supports jumps withj.
Jumps are either absolute, with a destination cell (e.g.,jA5),

or relative (e.g., j-7+1), with a column-row oﬀset. Rela-
tive jumps enable concise patterns. For example,r (m3 j-
3+2)2 m3 plays 3 rows of 4 cells from top to bottom, playing
each row left to right (Figure 5).
Automatic path length counting Writing turtle in-
structions requires counting cells on the grid. If a sequence
of notes is in a straight line, the user can select the cells and
see a count in the Excel status bar. However, this requires
manual eﬀort and is error-prone, and users found it particu-
larly inconvenient when adding notes to a partially complete
line and periodically testing the composition written so far.
Some users instructed turtles to move forward signiﬁcantly
more steps than required to avoid counting steps, but this
strategy doesn’t work for repeating paths.
We thus implementedm*, which instructs a turtle to move
as far as there are notes deﬁned in the direction it is facing.
After adding notes to the end of a line, the turtle instruc-
tions do not need editing before pressing play. A cell can
be explicitly deﬁned as a rest with a full stop (.). This is
required if multiple turtles are playing a repeating section
where some turtles end on rests, and others on notes. With-
out an explicit rest, the turtle would repeat too soon and
the parts would subsequently be out of alignment.
2.5 Excello’s use of spreadsheet affordances
HighlightingTo provide visual structure, turtle deﬁnitions
are automatically highlighted green. Cells containing deﬁ-
nitions of notes, or multiple notes, are highlighted red. Sus-
tain cells are highlighted a lighter red, showing correspon-
dence to notes whilst maintaining diﬀerentiation.
Chord Input To play a chord, multiple turtles must si-
multaneously pass through multiple cells corresponding to
the notes of the chord. Each cell and turtle is only re-
sponsible for up to one note at a time, maintaining high
notational consistency, as grid cells encode musical entities
at only one level of musical abstraction (notes). However,
this sacriﬁces the chord abstractions in languages like Sonic
Pi, such aschord('F#', 'maj7'), forcing users to constantly
think of chords in terms of their constituent notes, which
can inhibit theﬂow of composition. Our solution was to
include a tool for adding chords (right sidebar of Figure 1).
The user selects the chord root, type, inversion and starting
octave from menus. The insert button enters the notes of
the chord into the grid where the user has made a selection.
Notes are inserted to “ﬁt” the shape of the selection (ver-
tical or horizontal), and for a vertical selection, notes are
inserted from top to bottom in decreasing pitch order, to
mimic staﬀ notation (based on user feedback).
Transpose Some users found it more intuitive to consider
a melodic line by the intervals between notes rather than
by the note names. Moreover, many users sought to deﬁne
harmony lines by a transposition from a melody line.
Thus, a transposition function EXCELLO.MODULATE lets
melodic lines be deﬁned by the intervals between notes and
transposition of existing sections of a piece. The function
takes a cell and an interval and outputs the cell with any
notes transposed by the interval, maintaining any dynamics.
The advantage of implementing EXCELLO.MODULATE and
EXCELLO.TURTLE as spreadsheet functions is that it allows
users to take advantage of functionality such as drag-ﬁll,
formula autocomplete, graphical cell referencing, etc. For
example, a section can be modulated by calling this function
on theﬁrst note with a provided interval and then using
spreadsheet drag-ﬁll. A melodic line can be produced from
a starting note and a series of intervals as shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6: Transposing notes usingEXCELLO.MODULATE
2.6 Example: Piano Phase
Theﬁrst section of Reich’s Piano Phase is two identical pi-
ano melodies, one played slightly faster than the other [3].
The parts move out of phase, periodically aligning at dif-
ferent oﬀsets. It can be implemented in Manhattan using
24 rows of 3 columns [12]. Sonic Pi requires one line for
the notes and eight for playback. Excello only requires two
cells to deﬁne two turtles with diﬀerent speeds, in addition
to the notes. Piano Phase represented in these three sys-
tems is shown in Figure 7.

Phase. Top to bottom: Manhattan, Sonic Pi, Excello.

2.7 Implementation details
We implemented Excello as an add-in using the Oﬃ ce.js
API.2 When the play button is pressed, turtle deﬁnitions
in the grid are identiﬁed. For each, the starting cell and
movement instructions are used to establish the contents of
the cells it passes through. This is converted to a series of
note deﬁnitions: pitch, start time, duration, volume. These
are in turn passed to the the Tone.js library3 to schedule
and initiate playback.
3. COGNITIVE DIMENSIONS STUDY
Of the 21 initial participants, 19 continued using Excello af-
ter formative evaluation sessions over a period of 7-8 weeks
and participated in a user study. To ensure users suﬃ ciently
understood the interface before giving feedback, features
added after the initial sessions were recapped, and partic-
ipants completed a short task requiring transcription of a
short melody and authoring an additional phrase.
To study the properties of our system, we applied Black-
well and Green’s questionnaire [2] for evaluating informa-
tion devices’ usability using the Cognitive Dimensions of
Notations (CDN) framework. For example, the dimension
Role Expressiveness(how much an element suggests its pur-
pose) is assessed by: “Are there some parts that are partic-
ularly diﬃ cult to interpret?” . CDN can be used to analyse
musical notation [4] and software systems [7], so is ideal for
evaluating Excello’s notation and interface.
We focused on closeness of mapping, consistency, sec-
ondary notation, viscosity and visibility. The questions
used are shown in Table 9. Users responded with aﬁve-
point Likert scale. Responses were combined into negative
and non-negative categories. We tested the signiﬁcance of
the response distribution versus a uniform distribution with
chi-squared tests. Chi-squared testp-value and modal re-
sponses are shown in Table 2. The distribution of responses
is shown in Figure 9.
3.1 Comparative evaluation
By way of comparison, CDN results were also collected for
the user’s preferred music composition interface. 12 users
chose Sibelius, which was used for comparison. We think
this is a better comparison than to ChucK or Sonic Pi, since
Excello is designed to be an accessible introduction to music
programming for musicians familiar with more conventional
notations.
The signiﬁcance of each dimension varies for diﬀerent cog-
nitive activities [6], so users identiﬁed the proportion of time
they spent carrying out these activities (searching for infor-
mation, translating, incrementation, modiﬁcation and ex-
ploratory design). Figure 8 shows the time users reported
spending on the diﬀerent cognitive activities in Excello and
in Sibelius, based on results from 19 users for Excello and
12 for Sibelius. Translation is important for both interfaces.
Users perceived spending more time on modiﬁcation and in-
crementation in Excello. Little time is spent searching in
either tool.
We compared participants’ answers to the questions in
Table 2 for Excello and Sibelius. We performed a Wilcoxon

theﬁve responses as -2,-1,0,1,2. For all six questions, there
is no indication that the answers for the two interfaces come
from populations with diﬀerent means (i.e., no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences).
Closeness of mapping We found no signiﬁcant dif-
ference between Sibelius and Excello, suggesting Excello’s
spreadsheet notation has not compromised the closeness of
mapping (to the musical domain) of staﬀ notation.

Consistency We found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
Sibelius and Excello, suggesting that Excello’s notation is
no less consistent than staﬀ notation. Each cell and turtle
only produces one note at a time. Excello keeps consistency
with Excel by sharing notations (e.g., A1:A5 for ranges) and
using the existing formula editor.
Secondary notation We found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between Sibelius and Excello, suggesting that the spread-
sheet paradigm can provide secondary notation abilities
similar to Sibelius, software already equipped with numer-
ous ways to customise a score. Given the time spent trans-
lating, secondary notation is particularly important [4]. As
Excello abstracts time from the grid axes, existing Excel
features for formatting and grouping cells remain available.
Viscosity We found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence. This sug-
gests the interfaces have comparable viscosity. Allowing dy-
namics and octave marking to be omitted and letting turtles
count steps automatically, provides low resistance to mak-
ing additions and changes to the music. Furthermore, Excel
provides easy editing and movement of cells.
Visibility/Juxtaposition We found no signiﬁcant dif-
ference. This suggests that the spreadsheet interface can
provide a similar ability to view components as Sibelius.
4. CONCLUSION
We set out to explore the hypothesis that spreadsheets
would provide a productive medium for musical expression.
Excello is a notation and corresponding program for musi-
cal playback implemented within Microsoft Excel. By ab-
stracting time away from the axes of the grid, the exist-
ing functionality of Excel (whitespace, formatting, layout,
copy-paste and data storage) remains highly available and
useful. Excello was developed in close consultation with a
group of 21 users, as a result of this, many nuances in nota-
tional design were discovered, and our solutions were shown
to improve the interface and make it competitive (on cog-
nitive terms) with conventional composition tools. Excello
provides a simple, yet powerful interface for musical compo-
sition and programming to the hundreds of millions of users
already familiar with the spreadsheet interface.
In future work, we aim to explore live editing of the piece
as it plays, and graphical enhancements to show the loca-
tions of turtles during playback.
5. ETHICAL COMPLIANCE
Our study was approved by the Cambridge University com-
puter science departmental ethics review board. We con-
ducted pilot studies of the formative and summative evalu-
ation sessions, resulting in revisions to the protocol. Partic-
ipants were briefed, and signed forms of informed consent.
Participant data was anonymised and any audio recorded
during the sessions was transcribed and deleted.
