ABSTRACT
This paper aims at contributing to the discussion of DMI
design within speciﬁc cultural contexts. It presents a re-
ﬂection on designing and performing with zhu nao - a new
DMI grounded in Chinese culture. In our attempt to avoid
stereotypes commonly associated with the orientalist imag-
inary of Chinese culture, we based the design of our instru-
ment on the notion of cosmotechnics proposed by the Hong
Kong philosopher of technology Yuk Hui as a way to recon-
cile nature and technology by acknowledging the inﬂuence
of locality and local cosmologies on the development of sci-
entiﬁc and technical thinking.

1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in non-
Western approaches to NIME research [ 26, 56, 2, 2, 46, 9,
66, 34] consistent with the ongoing process of decoloniza-
tion within technological disciplines [ 21, 37, 43]. The Latin
American NIME (LATAM NIME) community 1 has taken a
particularly proactive stance in this regard [ 6, 39], estab-
lishing itself as a viable model of a cross-border research
and practice community with a distinct identity.
At the moment, the precedent set by the LATAM NIME
research network is yet to be recreated in other regions.
Despite the diverse range of electronic sound practices in
China—from electroacoustic composition, recently explored
in the special issue of Organised Sound [ 7],to a plethora of
experimental music scenes [ 25][50] and ways of incorporat-

ing sound in contemporary art[ 29][59]—Chinese sonic cul-
tures are still underrepresented in NIME, and only a hand-
ful of papers directly concerned with the Digital Musical
Instruments’ (DMIs) building in the region have been pub-
lished [ 11, 55, 63, 62, 27].
This paper aims at contributing to the discussion of DMI
design in China. It presents a reﬂection on designing and
performing with zhu nao , a new DMI deeply grounded in
Chinese culture. As authors of this paper come from diﬀer-
ent cultural backgrounds, we were conscious of the dangers
of portraying Chinese culture as the “Oriental Other”: ei-
ther in the “high tech ”techno-orientalist (or sinofuturist)
light [ 13] or as an atemporal, always-traditional entity [ 49].
In our attempt to avoid these stereotypes, we based the de-
sign of zhu nao on the notion of cosmotechnics, proposed by
the Hong Kong philosopher of technology Yuk Hui as a way
to reconcile nature and technology by acknowledging the in-
ﬂuence of locality and local cosmologies on the development
of scientiﬁc and technical thinking[ 30].
As a result, the design of zhu nao is inspired by a speciﬁc
locality—the outskirts of Guangzhou (Guangdong province,
China)—where the development of the instrument began
as a cross-cultural collaboration between the ﬁrst and sec-
ond authors. The experience of everyday life in this place
suggested local reference points that heavily informed the
design. Speciﬁcally, we focused on bamboo craftsmanship
as, simultaneously, an archetypal technical practice in East
Asia and an articulation of symbolic and practical dimen-
sions of the material. Furthermore, our design drew in-
spiration from environment improvisation —an approach to
free improvisation grounded in the aesthetics and philos-
ophy of shanshui—traditional Chinese landscape painting
and the associated way of forming aﬀective relations with
the environment [ 59]. Following Hui’s proposal, the two
main Chinese references—bamboo craftsmanship and envi-
ronment improvisation—are framed as cosmotechnical ac-
tivities.
We hope to further the conversation on digital lutherie
as a cosmotechnical activity, not exclusive to the Western-
centric understanding of technology. At the same time, it
can be considered a complementary approach to the study
of NIME craft [ 4]. Overall, with this paper we hope to
contribute to the discussion of technodiversity in NIME and
how cosmotechnical thinking can support such diversity.
2. AUTHORS’ SITUATED POSITIONS
The core idea and the initial artistic conception of the in-
strument arose from the ﬁrst author’s experience as a for-
eigner living and working in South China and his practice of
learning, making and performing alongside Chinese artists
for almost a decade. The actual development has been
conducted in close collaboration with the second author—
native Chinese—responsible for parts of technical develop-
ment. The theoretical framing has emerged in numerous
discussions among the authors.
3. BACKGROUND
3.1 Music Technology in China
Over the past two decades, a number of Chinese and in-
ternational researchers turned their attention to Chinese
electronic music and sonic arts, focusing on their various
aspects.
A recently published special issue of Organised Sound fo-
cused on electroacoustic music in China [ 8]. The contribu-
tions range from the analysis of speciﬁc pieces [ 64], stylistic
and regional variations in Chinese electroacoustic compo-
sitions [ 47] and practices of individual composers [ 65] to
inquiries into aesthetics and philosophy of electronic music
in China [ 15, 33]. Additionally, Routledge Research Com-
panion to Electronic Music [ 17] and Electroacoustic Music
in East Asia [ 7] both feature articles on China’s academic
electroacoustic music [ 36, 68]. The former presents Leigh’s
overview of strategies of cultural retention in China ’s elec-
troacoustic music [ 36], while the latter contains a ﬁrsthand
account of the early electroacoustic music development in
the region and its future prospects [ 68].
In a chapter of the book Half Sound Half Philosophy ,
which examines sonic arts in China through the lens of
China’s philosophical legacy, Wang addresses the role tech-
nology plays in the diverse sonic landscape of today ’s China.
Aside from the gallery-based sound art works she also exam-
ines practices of silicon luthiers in China, speciﬁcally point-
ing out Xu Cheng’s circuit bent instruments, Meng Qi’s
post-digital lutherie and Tian Jinqin’s pioneering EMI de-
sign work in the 1970s [ 59].
A number of studies have addressed the question of mu-
sical technology in China. Zimmermann analyzed how mu-
sical devices, mostly designed in the West, play out in non-
Western contexts, observing how material and cultural di-
mensions of technical objects are mediated in their use by
Chinese musicians [ 69]. Meanwhile, Lindtner et al. con-
ducted an ethnographic study of the elderly electronic hacker
community in China, particularly noting that their practices
do not quite ﬁt into the emancipatory narrative of DIY in
the West [ 40].
Despite the richness of this ﬁeld, a very small number of
NIME research has focused on this region . From a keyword
search of the archive of NIME proceedings a following pat-
tern emerges: out of the entirety of published articles, only
ﬁve explicitly refer to China, with three papers focused on
culturally-grounded NIME design [ 55, 11, 27], a case study
of inter-generational continuity in China’s NIME commu-
nity [ 63] and a comparative study of platforms for produc-
tion, dissemination and consumption of electronic music in
China and UK [ 12].
With this paper, we hope to further the debate on Chinese
NIME, as others [ 6, 39, 56] have, for instance, done for the
LATAM NIME.
3.2 Music and Technodiversity
Recent LATAM NIME scholarship has brieﬂy touched upon
the idea of cosmotechnics in DMI-building discourse with
the discussion of gambiarra as a locally-grounded form of
knowledge [ 56]. The concept of cosmotechnics was origi-
nally developed by the Hong Kong philosopher Yuk Hui in
his book The Question Concerning Technology in China [30]
as a way to the reconcile the opposition between nature and
technics, prominent in Western philosophy. Hui proposed to
re-examine indigenous approaches to technology in diﬀerent
cultures around the globe, stating that technical and cos-
mological thinking can not be understood in isolation. [ 32].
In this sense, a cosmology does not necessarily refer to the
cosmic phenomena but is rooted in local geography, every-
day life and imagination of the people and embeds itself in
relations between humans and non-humans within a given
culture. This line of thinking opens the way to what Hui
calls technodiversity—a pluralistic view of diﬀerent, cultur-
ally and cosmologically speciﬁc technological lineages co-
existing with each other, rather than being dominated by a
single totalizing narrative [ 31].
Another perspective pertinent to our discussion is that
of regional futurities , which began with retrospectively la-
beling the 1960s radical innovations in music driven by the
African diasporas as afrofuturism [ 25]. Afrofuturism pro-
posed an alternative to the dominant narratives in the his-
tory of Western electronic music as a linear progression from
Stockhausen to techno; instead it opens the possibility, in
Kodwo Eshun’s words: “to go back into a Ghanaian or
Indian or Vietnamese sonic past is to go forward into a new
future”[19]. To illustrate this idea, Sun Ra’s work is often
used as the prime example of the afrofuturist aesthetic and
political agenda [ 54].
These approaches oﬀer a way of including local ways of
knowledge in the development of technical systems and have
informed the design and the theoretical framing of the in-
strument we present in this paper.
3.3 The Issue of Orientalism(s)
Orientalism—famously diagnosed by Edward Said in his
eponymous book—is a colonial worldview that portrays “the
Orient”as a fundamentally distinct entity, both ontologi-
cally and epistemologically. This allows for “the Occident”
to exercise its authority by strategically dispatching ele-
ments of Western modernity [ 49]. An orientalist worldview
does not necessarily present the Other in a negative light.
A musical example is a particularly favorable portrayal of
Turkish people in Il Seraglio by Mozart; this attempt to a
sympathetic representation only serves to emphasize the dif-
ference. In NIME, this question has been recently addressed
in a short paper by Hatakeyama, who built her works as an
ironic commentary on the perceived monolithic character of
the “Asian culture ”[24].
Another form of quasi-orientalism paradoxically evolved
from the emancipatory discourse of afrofuturism [ 18]. How-
ever, while former has emerged as a self-reﬂective term,
sinofuturism,—a concept that gained some prominence in
the discourse surrounding art, music and literature coming
from China or inspired by it—is a diﬀerent matter alto-
gether. The term was coined by Steve Goodman—Scottish
philosopher and electronic music producer, once adjacent to
the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU) of Warwick
University (UK) [ 16]. One of the CCRU’s text, authored by
Nick Land and later adapted into a audio-visual piece Melt-
down, served as the inspiration for the term, prophesying
the arrival of “Neo-China from the future ”[35].
Originally a philosophical project, it eventually came to
fruition as a futuristic (predominantly) sonic aesthetic rooted
in the pre-millennium geopolitical anxiety and echoing William
Gibson’s techno-orientalist fantasies of the cyberpunk Japan.
As such, it has been criticized as a brand of quasi-orientalism
rather than being an “an incisive provocation of Chinese
futures concretely rooted in the Chinese condition ”[67].
Sinofuturism is, paradoxically, equally rooted in the eman-
cipatory narrative of afrofuturism and colonial logic of ori-
entalism as theorized by Said in the 1970s [ 49]. The link
between sinofuturism as inverse orientalism and oriental-
ism “proper”lies in their denial of the ability of the Other
to eﬀectively represent itself. De Seta, citing Fabian, calls
this phenomenon the refusal of coevalness, understood as
a forceful imposition of a distinct temporality never quite
synchronized with the Western time [ 16].
While the debate on the sinofuturism lies outside the
scope of this paper, it nonetheless inﬂuenced the design of
the instrument. In the essay published in the SFRA Re-
view special issue on Sinofuturisms 2, Zhang stresses that
sinofuturism is not a stable entity [ 67]: outside the sprawl-
ing megacities, there are rural and transitional zones such
as urban-rural fringes that are also exemplary of the Chi-
nese futurity in the making. Such a place was the site of
the design of our instrument.
Both sinofuturism and orientalism, while radically diﬀer-
ent, represent two extremes of a stereotyped vision of China
that is still prevalent in Western culture. With our paper,
we try to avoid both of them: we infer our design from
constant contact with the locality, trying to enact a DMI
design approach that accounts for the existence of multiple
cosmotechnics.
4. ZHU NAO DESIGN
zhu nao（竹脑）, translated literally bamboo brain or bamboo
mind, is a colloquial term that refers to the topmost leafy
part of a bamboo stem and, at times, to the underground
part of the plant. Intended as a homophonous pun (om-
nipresent in Chinese languages) the name echoes the literal
translation of the Chinese word “computer”dian nao (电
脑 - literally electronic brain) and serves as a lighthearted
acknowledgment of computational processes at the core of
the instrument and its botanical origins.
4.1 Cultural References
The design of the instrument was motivated by the lived
experience of the ﬁrst author working and residing at the
far periphery of Guangzhou. This speciﬁc location is cur-
rently undergoing rapid development and is often described
as an ” urban-rural fringe ”. Urban-rural landscape of this
place encompasses contours of infrastructure in the making
(high-speed train lines, highway interchanges, a mesh-work
of 5G towers), large-scale construction projects (building
sites, industrial areas, newly-built university campuses) and
still prevalent rural areas (ﬁelds, farms and villages). All of
these elements combined, amount to a fascinating environ-
ment, best described by Chinese artists Gong Jian and Li
Jinghu:“The urban-rural fringe is a place rife with imagina-
tion, a place in which various possibilities and contingencies
are manifest. ”3.
Based on the experience of living in this context, we ini-
tiated a speculation on how to render the experience pecu-
liar to this location in a new DMI tailored for experimen-
tal electronic music performance. We proceeded by look-
ing for activities grounded in this particular locality that
could be labeled as “cosmotechnical”. The ﬁrst activity—
environment improvisation , a musical approach pioneered
by the Chinese soundartist Li Jianhong, came along thanks

rban-rural-fringe-and-why-is-it-the-urban-rural-f
ringe/
to the ﬁrst author’s familiarity with the Chinese experi-
mental music scene. The second activity— bamboo craft –––
serendipitously emerged from the experience of everyday life
in the urban-rural environment: it does not take long for
one to stumble upons some form of bamboo-based objects
in such places. The timing of these mundane “bamboo
encounters”coincided with the ﬁrst author’s search for the
possible design direction of our instrument, we swiftly re-
connected bamboo to a rich milieu of craft and philosophical
investigations of this material.
4.2 Environment Improvisation
As stated above, one of our main goals was to explore the
concept of environment improvisation developed by Chinese
sound artist Li Jianhong. Li is widely acknowledged as one
of the underground pioneers of improvised music in China
[52]. Li’s explorations of free improvisation as a means of
retaining memories of familiar places and sounds of every-
day life drove him to incorporate extra-musical inﬂuences
into his practice, one of them being the philosophy of shan-
shui（山水）commonly associated with Chinese landscape
painting [58]. According to Wang, shanshui exempliﬁes reci-
procity between aesthetic, cosmic and moral qualities. By
the late 00s the concept of environment improvisation was
developed enough to be formalized and applied to several
recorded works. What began as a simple impulse to ”make
music with the rain” while weathering the heavy rainstorm
in the Faxi temple in Hangzhou [ 58] developed into a con-
sistent artistic strategy drawing on the intimacy of personal
experience and memory tuning into the “tacit resonance ”
(known as moqi 默契）with the environment [ 59].
Wang further explicates environment improvisation as a
non-dialogical form of musicking, contrary to the habitual
understanding of improvisation as a collective, communica-
tive activity. For example, the ambient sound of raindrops
so prominent in Li’s Twelve Moods is entirely independent
of his actions. This sets Li’s concept apart from similar en-
vironmentally aware approaches to creative sonic practices,
such as deep listening, ﬁeld recording or soundscape-related
work.
4.3 Material Reﬂection
Figure 1: zhu nao.
Bamboo bears a particular signiﬁcance in Chinese cul-
ture, technics and ecology. The crucial role of bamboo in
the history of technology is not exclusive to China, as bam-
boo is commonly found in many other countries, especially
in East Asia. That said, the nature of the project has nar-
rowed the referential frame to that of Mainland China and
Hong Kong—the areas that the authors are most familiar
with. Species of bamboo native to southern China (pre-
dominantly mao zhu and huang zhu ) have been used for
millennia to erect temporary or semi-permanent structures
(e.g. gardening supports, scaﬀolding) and make various
tools. The mythological origins of bamboo craftsmanship
in China are sometimes traced all the way back to the ur-
architect Youchao [ 60], while the earliest technical descrip-
tions of the use of bamboo in carpentry and construction
are attributed to the legendary carpenter and tool-maker
Lu Ban （鲁班）, believed to have lived in the chunqiu（春
秋）period (771-476 BC) in China [ 48].
Among myriads of bamboo applications, many of the tra-
ditional musical instruments in China are made of bamboo,
for example di （笛）and xiao（箫）ﬂutes, mouth organ
sheng（笙）, bowed instruments such as jinghu（京胡）and
plucked instruments such as tube zithers. Moreover, it has
been noted that the physical properties of bamboo are so
distinct, that the material determines form and function of
the resulting instrument to a higher degree, compared to
more malleable materials. This contributes to what some
consider a distinct organological category of cross-cultural
bamboo instruments [ 22]. Bamboo and its derivatives (e.g.
ﬂexible strips used in our design) are still used in a variety
of traditional crafts: furniture-making, basket-weaving and
construction of bird-cages among others [ 61].
Beyond its utilitarian function, bamboo has had an enor-
mous inﬂuence on the development other cultural forms,
both as an early medium of writing, Bamboo Annals （竹
书纪年）being one of the earliest examples [ 53], and a raw
material in paper manufacturing, as well as exerting a sig-
niﬁcant inﬂuence on art, literature and other intellectual
pursuits. A prime example of it is Seven Sages of the Bam-
boo Grove（竹林七贤）, a subject matter that has appeared
in numerous artistic works over the centuries: from Jin Dy-
nasty (266-420AD) tomb engravings to Yang Fudong’s ex-
perimental video art. 4
Another notable example is the story of Ming era Neo-
Confucian intellectual Wang Yangming [ 51], who famously
(and unsuccessfully) attempted to infer the nature of things
by gazing at the bamboo reeds in his garden - the process
known as gezhu（格竹）—bamboo investigations [41]. Wang
Yangming’s legacy is a essential part of the intellectual his-
tory of China and still serves as a source of inspiration for
artists, as seen, for example, in Zheng Bo’s work Bamboo as
Method5.
5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
In our attempt to counteract the two-fold orientalist stereo-
typing discussed above, it was decided early on that rather
than attempting to mimic centuries-old traditions of Chi-
nese artisans and luthiers, emphasizing the instrument’s
computational aspects or exploiting the perceived diﬀerence
between the two, we would attempt to strike a balance be-
tween actualization of the material’s cultural and material
properties, intrinsic geometries that bamboo aﬀords, and
technologies of sensing and communication that deﬁne a
DMI as such.
Technically, zhu nao follows a typical DMI architecture,
consisting of three fundamental blocks: 1) tangible inter-
face, 2) data mapping hub and 3) a sound engine. These

subsystems communicate with each other via Open Sound
Control (OSC) 6
The microprocessor in the tangible interface transmits
sensor readings as OSC messages to the sensor-processing
hub via the UDP protocol. At that stage, the environmental
and gestural data are fused together, processed by the Ma-
chine Learning (ML) algorithm and mapped onto the sound
engine parameters. Additionally, the performer’s gestures
are routed and directly mapped onto the sound engine, by-
passing the ML.
5.1 Tangible Interface (Material and sensors)
To achieve our material-related goals, we used a heat-treated
1.5m long bamboo pole of the mao zhu species sourced from
Zhejiang province with the cross-sectional diameter of 3.5cm
[Fig.2]. The nodal diaphragms inside the bamboo pole were
then punctured to form a continuous cavity housing elec-
tronic components and sensor wiring.
The instrument uses three sensors connected to the ESP32
microcontroller: a pair of ﬂex sensors (conditioned with an
op-amp-based buﬀer), a ground moisture sensor and an om-
nidirectional antenna extender that simultaneously acts as a
WiFi signal strength sensor and transmits OSC messages to
the data-mapping hub. The intended player posture came
along during the prototyping stage: seated behind the in-
strument, left and right arms holding the bamboo strips,
while the moisture sensor acts as the end-pin anchoring the
6https://opensoundcontrol.stanford.edu/files/1997
-ICMC-OSC.pdf
instrument in addition to serving its primary function. Elec-
tronics, micro-controller, Li-Po battery, a switch, wiring and
the antenna plug are mounted inside the protective shell
made of a thicker bamboo at the top of the instrument [Fig
1.].
The player twists and bends two stacks of three 0.5mm
thick ﬂexible bamboo strips with ﬂex sensors sandwiched
inside. These stacks are bent and inserted into slots in the
main body of the instrument on the left and right side sim-
ilarly to a mortise-and-tenon joint. The stacks are wrapped
in the middle with nylon string, indicating the intended
position of player’s hands. This structure allows the instru-
ment to be quickly assembled and disassembled for trans-
portation.
5.2 Data Mapping
The ESP32 micro-controller sends sensor readings to sensor-
processing hub via OSC messages for sensor fusion, data
processing and mapping. Flex sensors readings are scaled
and directly mapped onto the sound parameters of the audio
engine in a “one-to-many”conﬁguration. The mapping
of ﬂex sensors is not linear and their response curves were
tweaked and adjusted to “feel right ”rather than following
any strict procedure.
Conversely, the environmental data (ground moisture and
WiFi signal strength) are processed using Machine Learning
(ML) to predict diﬀerent states according to the previously
recorded values, thus retaining “memories”of past perfor-
mances. In this case, the workﬂow is similar to Wekinator
[20] and the multi-sensor Topics 7 setup was inspired by the
Robot Operating System (ROS) framework 8.
Two diﬀerent machine learning algorithms are implemented
and can be chosen for non-time sensitive/time-sensitive situ-
ations: Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Long-Short Term
Memory (LSTM). For each prediction, a window of an ad-
justable size of messages is selected and passed into the
algorithm. We trained these networks using recordings of
past interactions with the instrument.
Finally, the prediction results (along with the raw sen-
sor readings) are parsed as OSC messages and sent (via
UDP) to the sound engine running on a local machine for
co-located performances or to a remote computer for telem-
atic performances by using a reverse proxy setup.
5.3 Sound Design
The sound design of zhu nao was intentionally simplistic.
Nonetheless, it resulted in a timbral range that proved to
be constrained enough to remain distinct yet varied enough
to warrant exploration: from subtle resonant ringing to dis-
torted walls of “runaway”feedback reminiscent of Li Jian-
hong’s electric guitar feedback pieces.
The sound engine was built in Pure Data 9. The core of
the sound engine is a twin network of resonant bandpass
ﬁlters processing white noise. The ﬁltered signal is then fed
into the delay line, after which its two outputs are routed
back into the ﬁlter network. Twisting and ﬂexing the left
sensor translates into the Q-value of ﬁlters in both networks
and the attenuation of the main output: fully bent strip
results in the highest amplitude and the most pronounced
resonant frequency that gets softer and eventually cuts oﬀ
as the bamboo strip returns to its original state. The right
sensor determines the overall pitch by controlling the cutoﬀ
7http://wiki.ros.org/Topics
8https://www.ros.org/
9https://puredata.info/
frequency of the ﬁlter bank, constrained within the range of
approximately two octaves.
The environmental data processed by a neural network
is used to modulate the amount of feedback in a delay line
shifting the balance between the immediate output of ﬁlter
banks and full-blown feedback. In this particular case, our
use of ML was meant as a reference to the role that memory
plays in the practice of environment improvisation. This
setup creates a feedback loop between the performer and the
past and present environments mediated by the instrument.
6. ZHU NAO ON STAGE
The ﬁrst author had a chance to perform with zhu nao on
two occasions: an experimental music festival in Shanghai
organized by the China Academy of Art and a telematic
performance within the academic context of the authors’
home institution.
Generally speaking, the audience of the ﬁrst event was
accustomed to experimental music, while in the latter case
the audience consisted of primarily sci-tech students, most
of whom were unfamiliar with the ﬁeld, but knowledgeable
in the computational media.
After the concerts we engaged in conversations with the
audience who were predominantly Chinese. The material
of the instrument itself attracted some attention and gen-
erated some discussions, with people commenting on the
craftsmanship required to make the instrument and bring-
ing up the “organic”relation between the materials, per-
forming techniques and the sonic output while others com-
mented on the “ritualistic”quality of the setup and pre-
sentation. Meanwhile, the link between environmental data,
Machine Learning and its inﬂuence on the sound remained
somewhat ambiguous. Some of the audience members ques-
tioned whether there was more “trickery”and automation
occurring at the software level.
While we did not record these conversions and thus can-
not refer to them as formal sources of validation, these in-
teractions as well as the actual experience of performing
with the instrument were integral to our work on the in-
strument and thus inﬂuenced the reﬂections developed in
the following section.
7. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:
A REFLECTION ON ACTION
We relied on the“reﬂection on action ”approach [57] - which
“takes place after the activity and enables the exploration
of what happened and why in order to develop questions,
ideas and examples about the activities and practices in
focus”[?] to develop several design reﬂections based on the
experience of designing and performing with zhu nao.
In particular, performing with the instrument quickly proved
that the relation to environment improvisation through the
use of environmental data and ML was rather oblique to the
audience and was easily overshadowed by the “stage pres-
ence”of the material, thus most of the discussion focused
on the role of bamboo. Additionally, while environment
improvisation largely determined the design of the interac-
tive schema, it did not pose signiﬁcant challenges in terms
of technical implementation. On the contrary, bamboo re-
quired us to develop a new skillset and look into an unfamil-
iar tradition. For these reasons the considerations that we
proposed here mainly revolve around bamboo as a material
of DMI craft.
7.1 Crafting Bamboo
zhu nao contains many elements that bridge artisanal prac-
tices with the more conventional DMI design workﬂow. The
choice of material limited the possibilities for digital fabri-
cation, which prompted us to rely on manual manipulations
instead. For example, using long metal rods to crush the
diaphragms inside the bamboo pole and binding the body
of the instrument near the cut slots to prevent it from split-
ting. Interestingly, both of these techniques belong to the
arsenal of traditional techniques of luthiers in Asia, for ex-
ample Chinese bamboo ﬂutes zhu di （竹笛）makers. From
this perspective, the material possesses a degree of agency,
imposing a speciﬁc music-making framework [4] determin-
ing the choice of tools and the margins of interventions.
While NIME has been discussed as a form of digital craft
[42] and contrasting it to other forms of non-digital craft and
lutherie [ 3], bamboo comes with its own set of perspectives
that we outline below.
The element that was already present at the ideation
stage but fully manifested itself while traveling and main-
taining the instrument was the high workability and in-
herent modularity of bamboo structures. This type of in-
trinsic modularity essentially predates the modular design
approach, often necessitated by mass production, and is
closely related to the craft of quickly assembling, extend-
ing and dismantling bamboo structures such as scaﬀold-
ing. Techniques of bamboo scaﬀolding are still prominent
in Hong Kong and China and only require bamboo poles
and nylon strings, both of which were used in our design.
This aspect of bamboo construction became crucial when
faced with the practical issues of transporting and main-
taining the instrument: e.g. the ﬂexible parts subjected to
mechanical stress are simply inserted into the body of the
instrument and, in case of an accident, can be replaced with
minimal eﬀort.
As a fast growing plant, bamboo is a sustainable and
cheap material, which makes it a valuable asset for DMI
crafting, especially in light of the recent discussions of longevity
and sustainability in NIME [ 44][23]. Combined with the
aforementioned intrinsic modularity, the use of such mate-
rials can extend the lifecycle of an instrument, as its parts
can be easily and aﬀordably replaced in case of damage.
Interestingly, the use of bamboo is consistent with ongo-
ing discussion of assemblages in NIME. In line with the In-
goldian proposition of Bowers and colleagues to “follow the
materials”as they come together as things [10] we attempted
to emphasize semi-permanence and “eﬀortlessness”in the
way multiple components are assembled in our design. This
type of modularity aﬀorded by crafting techniques intrinsic
to the material can arguably oﬀer a valuable non-western
perspective to NIME practice.
7.2 Bamboo As Storied Material
Bamboo’s symbolic dimension plays an important role in
the cultural landscape of China. From its associations with
the literati culture and numerous mentions in poetry and
painting, bamboo has often been portrayed as a subject
possessing a degree of agency unfolding in its relations with
people [ 1]. The famed Chinese poet Su Shi suggested that
to paint bamboo stalks one must “carry the bamboo in her
mind”referring to the ability to render the hidden vitality of
a material object in an artwork, which constitutes a mutual
becoming: the artist becomes bamboo through internaliz-
ing the vital principle of the plant, while bamboo becomes
externalized as an artwork [ 1].
This rich iconicity inscribed in bamboo presents a way
of creating a narrative by just using the material and oﬀers
new ways of communicating with the audiences. Discussions
that we have engaged in while designing and performing
with zhu nao showed that almost everyone we talked to had
something to say about it, commenting on the materials,
craftsmanship and presentation. It often served as a source
of jokes and puns or as a ground to share personal stories
and historical anecdotes. This discursive dimension opened
up many layers of the cultural history of bamboo that the
authors were initially unfamiliar with.
The fact that musical or cultural ideas are inscribed in in-
struments is well established in DMI literature but the fact
that it can be inscribed in the material itself remains rela-
tively unexplored, with the exception of some works inﬂu-
enced by the media-archeological approach [ 38, 28]. In con-
trast, investigations of both physical and conceptual prop-
erties of materials are relatively common in practice-led and
artistic research [ 45]. Bringing this sensibility into the de-
sign of DMI could be a way of going a layer below the found
object approach [ 14].
8. A REFLECTION ON COSMOTECHNICS
The concept of cosmotechnics presents the multiplicity of
culturally speciﬁc technical practices as local ways of know-
ing and being [ 32]. In Hui’s words cosmotechnics proposes
a“way to unify moral and cosmic orders through technical
activities”by rediscovering technical lineages grounded in
speciﬁc localities [ 32]. While Hui tends to emphasize the
value of tradition, cosmotechnics cannot be reduced to the
caricature of “rejecting modernity and embracing tradi-
tion”but rather should be considered as a way of breaking
down the myth of technological universalism. As every piece
of technology comes inscribed with speciﬁc epistemological
and cosmological assumptions, for Hui the path to genuine
technodiversity begins with addressing these assumptions
[30].
While the concept of cosmotechnics on its own does not
explicitly present a normative framework or a design method-
ology, the nature of the material itself and the key references
guided us towards this idea in our design reﬂections. We rely
on it as a means of foregrounding a speciﬁc sensibility to-
wards creative practice and a way of rethinking the relations
between environment, culture and technology. Cosmotech-
nical thinking extends itself to all of the main references in
the design of zhu nao from bamboo crafting to contempo-
rary creative practices such as environment improvisation.
In this sense, cosmotechnical thought could be considered as
the source of relational consistency that holds together this
speciﬁc type of NIME-assemblage (as theorized by Bowers
and Haas) [ 10].
Making musical instruments is one of the oldest crafts
known to humanity and, while it could be considered a uni-
versal activity—a technical tendency in the words of an-
thropologist Andr´ e Leroi-Gourhan, the diversity of techni-
cal facts is precisely where instrument building presents it-
self as an essentially cosmotechnical activity [ 5]. Making
new instruments (digital, post-digital or otherwise) in the
21st century belongs to this continuum as much as it is a
speculation of the possible futures of musicking. Designer’s
attunement to the locality as a form of knowledge, to the
material and conceptual agencies of materials and crafting
techniques is therefore required to make sure that these fu-
tures are not projected from the outside but grow out of a
given environment (material or otherwise) much like bam-
boo shoots.
This paper presents our attempt to enact this principle
in a DMI design. We argue that designing musical instru-
ments aligned with region-speciﬁc traditional material cul-
tures and contemporary artistic strategies has a potential to
contribute to the growing vocabulary of NIME design ap-
proaches. As a side contribution, the practical experience
that we gained while building zhu nao has allowed us to dis-
till possible design considerations for future bamboo-based
DMIs. Finally, we hope that by incorporating the diversity
of cosmotechnics into the NIME ethos, we can contribute a
new perspective to the ongoing discourse of decoloniality in
the ﬁeld.
9. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Clarence
Cheung for his contribution at the early stage of the project,
Fabio Morrealse and Adam Pultz Melbye for sharing their
thoughts about the draft of this paper and Adam Brillhart
for lending us his knowledge of Chinese carpentry.
10. ETHICAL STANDARDS
All photo video and audio documentation was made by the
authors, no unauthorized assets were used while working on
the projects. All relevant sources were cited. The micro-
controller used in the instrument is ESP-32, programmed
with open-source Arduino IDE. All sounds were created in
freeware Pure Data (vanilla distribution). The instrument
was built using renewable materials (locally-sourced bam-
boo). Electronics and the only 3D-printed part (battery
compartment) were transferred to each successive iteration
to minimize waste. The instrument uses a single recharge-
able Li-Po cell and no disposable batteries were used during
the work on the project.
