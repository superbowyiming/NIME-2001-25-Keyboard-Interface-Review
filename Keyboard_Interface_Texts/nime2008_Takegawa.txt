ABSTRACT
Musical keyboard instruments have a long history, which
resulted in many kinds of keyboards (claviers) today. Since
the hardware of conventional musical keyboards cannot be
changed, such as the number of keys, musicians have to
carry these large keyboards for playing music that requires
only a small diapason. To solve this problem, the goal of
our study is to construct UnitKeyboard, which has only 12
keys (7 white keys and 5 black keys) and connectors for
docking with other UnitKeyboards. We can build various
kinds of musical keyboard conﬁgurations by connecting one
UnitKeyboard to others, since they have automatic settings
for multiple keyboard instruments. We discuss the usability
of the UnitKeyboard from reviews by several amateur and
professional pianists who used the UnitKeyboard.

1. INTRODUCTION
Musical keyboard instrument has a long history, resulting
in many kinds of keyboards today (ex. piano, choir organ,
and accordion). Moreover, there are many kinds of musical
forms in classical piano performance:solo,w h i c hi sp l a y e d
by one performer,piano duet,w h i c hi sap e r f o r m a n c eb yt w o
performers with a single piano,piano duo,w h i c hi sap e r -
formance by two performers with two pianos, andensemble,
which is a performance by multiple groups that consist of
two or more musicians.
At the same time, various kinds of electronic musical in-
struments have been developed. These instruments have
many kinds of functions, such as diapason change and tone
change. Since conventional musical keyboards cannot change
their hardware conﬁguration, such as the number of keys,
musicians have to carry large keyboards for playing music
that requires only a small diapason. Moreover, it is diﬃcult
to adjust to various kinds of keyboard instruments. For ex-
ample, musicians cannot play music for the organ with a
digital piano with 88 keys.
The goal of our study is to construct UnitKeyboard, which
has only 12 keys (7 white keys and 5 black keys) and 4 con-
nectors for docking with other UnitKeyboards. With these

keyboards, we can build various kinds of keyboard conﬁg-
urations by connecting a UnitKeyboard to other UnitKey-
boards. Since they have automatic settings considering the
relationship among UnitKeyboards, and intuitive controls
using sensors and actuators. Because of these special func-
tions, UnitKeyboard is a ﬂexibly instrument for playing mu-
sic.

also 4 connectors for connecting to other UnitKeyboards.
Also various kinds of keyboards can be simulated with them.
For example, we can construct a keyboard of two octaves
by connecting two UnitKeyboards horizontally, as shown in
Figure 1-(a). Moreover, we can construct an organ that has
two manuals by connecting two UnitKeyboards vertically as
shown in Figure 1-(b). We can also increase the diapason
by connecting an EnhancedUnit, which has various kinds
of functions, between UnitKeyboards as shown in Figure
1-(c).
2.1 Characteristics of UnitKeyboard
2.1.1 Automatic Settings
We can build various kinds of keyboard instruments by
docking multiple UnitKeyboards. However, users need to
conﬁgure various kinds of settings for each UnitKeyboard.
To reduce the setting time, we propose an automatic setting
algorithm.

tone and the diapason for each UnitKeyboard depend on
the conﬁguration of the connections. Generally, single man-
ual keyboards like the piano, have characteristics that the
more left/right the position of a key, the lower/higher its
pitch, and all of the keys have the same tone. Therefore, a
UnitKeyboard horizontally connected to a BaseUnit, which
controls the base settings such as the tone and the diapa-
son, inherits the tone of the BaseUnit, and a diapason of the
UnitKeyboard increases one octave based on the diapason
of the BaseUnit as shown in Figure 1. On the other hand, a
UnitKeyboard vertically connected to the BaseUnit has the
same diapason as that of the BaseUnit, and the tone of the
UnitKeyboard is independent from that of the BaseUnit.
Priority Between a BaseUnit and a non-BaseUnit, there
is a hierarchical relationship, that is, the settings of the
non-BaseUnit inherit those of the BaseUnit. We deﬁne this
as priority. This is similar to an ensemble, where the mul-
tiple sections have section leaders or there is a conductor
of the entire ensemble. Our system automatically assigns
UnitKeyboard as low priority based on settings of a high
priority UnitKeyboard.
2.1.2 Real-Time reconﬁguration
Since there may be cases where the conﬁgurations and
connection statuses of the UnitKeyboards should be changed
during the performance, the system needs to detect them
and reconﬁgures the settings of the UnitKeyboards in real-
time.
We discuss the system design for fast real-time processing
from the views points of data management.
Data management In a UnitKeyboard system, there are
various kinds of system data: connection data to manage
the connection relationships among UnitKeyboards, setting
data for setting the diapason and the tone of each UnitKey-
board, and keying data that is generated when keys of a
UnitKeyboard are pressed/released.
If each UnitKeyboard manages its own settings, each
UnitKeyboard sends a connection change message to all
the UnitKeyboards. Because the CPU and memory in a
UnitKeyboard is limited, it is diﬃcult to do this in real-
time.
Therefore, we use a computer as the “host” to calculate
the connection statuses, setting statuses for all UnitKey-
boards in the system.
3. PROTOTYPE SYSTEM
Figure 2 shows the structure of the prototype system.
It consists of a host, UnitKeyboards, and EnhancedUnits.
Figure 3: A snapshot of UnitKeyboard
Figure 3 shows a snapshot of a UnitKeyboard. We im-
plemented the system using Microsoft Visual C++ .NET
2003, and we use a Sony Vaio VGN-S92PS, with the Win-
dows XP platform as the host, Allow7 UM-100 as a wireless
module, Roland SC-8820 as a MIDI sound generator, and
M-audio OXYGEN8 as the keyboard. OXYGEN8 has 25
keys but we cut one in half to make the 12-keys. We use
ap r o g r a m m a b l ei n t e g r a t e dc i r c u i t( P I C )m i c r o c o m p u t e r
(PIC16F873) to control the UnitKeyboard and Enhance-
dUnit. The software on the PIC is programmed in C lan-
guage on Microchip Technology’s MPLAB.
3.1 Host
In the prototype, we used a PC as the host. The functions
of the host are as follows.
Management of setting data The host manages the
setting data of each Unit. Note that a Unit includes teh
UnitKeyboard and the EnhancedUnit.
Management of connection statusesThe host directly
manages the connection statuses of all the Units. Moreover,
the host calculates the setting data of each Unit’s conﬁgu-
ration from the connection data of all the Units.
Process of sound generation The host generates a
MIDI Note On/Oﬀ messages based on the setting data of
the Units and keying data sent from a UnitKeyboard.
3.2 UnitKeyboard
The hardware structure of a Unit is shown in Figure 4. A
UnitKeyboard consists of a PIC, a 12-key keyboard connec-
tors on all four sides, and a wireless module to communicate
to the host. A UnitKeyboard has the following functions.

3.3 EnhancedUnit
The EnhancedUnit has two models: a simple model that
only controls the diapason of a UnitKeyboard and a high-
end model that is equipped with sensors, actuators, and a
wireless module to operate settings of the UnitKeyboards.
The former is inserted between UnitKeyboards to increase
the diapason. It has a simple structure that consists of two
connectors and a variable electric resistance.Since the con-
nectors of a UnitKeyboard can measure the change of volt-
age that works with the number of the variable resistance,
UnitKeyboards that interleave with simple EnhancedUnits
convert the amount of voltage to changing the diapason.
Figure 4 shows hardware of the high-end EnhancedUnit.
The main diﬀerences between the EnhancedUnit and the
UnitKeyboard are that the EnhancedUnit does not have a
keyboard and has various input/output devices. The high-
end EnhancedUnit has the following functions.
Connection to the host The enhancedUnit broadcasts
a“ N e wE n t r y ”c o m m a n da f t e rt h ep o w e ri st u r n e d - o na n d
establishes connections with the host just like a UnitKey-
board.
Sending connection data The EnhancedUnit monitors
the status of its own connectors, and it sends a “Connection
Status” command to the host when it detects a change of
connection just like the UnitKeyboard.
Sending of input data from input devicesThe En-
hancedUnit collects data from input devices, and informs
the host of this according to the requirements of the host.
Control of output devicesThe EnhancedUnit controls
output devices according to commands sent from the host.
3.3.1 Input/Output devices
We developed a high-end EnhancedUnit prototype equipped
with various kinds of input/output devices.

UnitKeyboard and the EnhancedUnit, the higher the dia-
pason of the UnitKeyboarda.

boards with the users’ posture that is calculated and de-
tected from data of the acceleration sensor.

EnhancedUnit equipped with a motor and wheels, they
can add/subtract a diapason by automatically moving a
UnitKeyboard as shown in Figure 5.
4. CONSIDERATIONS
We discuss the usability of proposed UnitKeyboard from
the reviews by 5 amateur pianists and 5 professional pianists
that actually used the UnitKeyboard. We have demon-
strated UnitKeyboard in various kinds of events such as
Kobe Luminarie Live Stageon December 8th and 9th, 2007.
It began in 1995 and commemorates the Great Hanshin
earthquake of that year about 4 million participants at-
tended last year.
4.1 Performance Evaluation
Visibility We checked the function that automatically
assigns the settings of the UnitKeyboard assuming the re-
lationship among all the UnitKeyboards were working well.
The host settled conﬂicting settings among the UnitKey-
boards. Moreover, the proposed automatic-assignment al-
gorithm was intuitive from participants’ reviews.
Because he participants could see the connection rela-
tionships between the UnitKeyboards, it was easy to rec-
ognize the relative diapason of each UnitKeyboard. How-
ever, it was diﬃcult to recognize the absolute diapason of
each UnitKeyboard. In present implementation, partici-
pants could not see the BaseUnit and the diapason of the
BaseUnit. Therefore, participants had to press the keys of
each UnitKeyboard to check the diapason.
For future work, we plan to develop an EnhancedUnit
with LEDs and a display for checking the settings of the
UnitKeyboard.
Wireless vs. Wired connectionsWe adopted a wireless
connection for communication between the host and the
Units.
In the wireless connection, although there was some de-
lay between the keying to the output sound. The delay was
not so noticeable in the music. However, the more UnitKey-
boards were used, the higher the possibility was for packet
loss and longer delays.
On the other hand, the delay produced using wired con-
nection was less than that of the wireless connection.
Because both methods have advantages and disadvan-

tages, we will conduct a more detailed evaluation for each
method in future work.
One-octave UnitKeyboard In this study, a UnitKey-
board had only one octave from C to B. This diapason is
eﬀective in music of only C major or C minor.We can solve
this problem by using the Mobile Clavier[7], which enables
as m o o t hc h a n g ei nd i a p a s o n .
4.2 New performance
We conducted performance with UnitKeyboards and En-
hancedUnits.
As shown in Figure 6, when there was a lack of diapason
during the performance, a musician solved it by borrow-
ing a UnitKeyboard from another performer. Moreover, as
shown in Figure 5, a keyboard moving automatically to a
commanded location was visually interesting. These perfor-
mances are not only musically entertaining but also visually
attractive.
4.3 RELATED WORK
There has been a large amount of research whose main
goal was improving a function by combining simple func-
tional units. For example, users can control an object in a
game by combining LEGO blocks[1], control website brows-
ing by combining triangle boards[2], or control program-
ming with combined blocks[3]. Moreover, there are block
interface equipped input/output devices[4]. These targets
were not musical like our study.
On the other hand, a system whose for music composition
functions by combining blocks assigned for mood music[5].
Moreover, there are systems, DoublePad/Bass[6] and Mo-
bile Clavier[7], which were developed to improve the porta-
bility of acoustic instruments. DoublePad/Bass is base in-
struments using two PDAs. Musicians who play an electric
bass should be able to easily play it. Mobile Clavier en-
ables the smooth change of diapason by allowing additional
black keys to be inserted. These instruments were not de-
signed with concept of combining units or for various kinds
of keyboard/string instruments
5. CONCLUSIONS
We proposed the UnitKeyboard, which can apply vari-
ous kinds of keyboard instruments by connecting one-octave
keyboards together. Moreover, the UnitKeyboard has var-
ious functions such as the automatic settings considering
the relationship among multiple UnitKeyboards, intuitive
controls and new performance using an EnhancedUnit.
We intend to evaluate the hardware and the usability of
the system in the future.
