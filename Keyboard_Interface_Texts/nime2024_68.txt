ABSTRACT
This paper describes the development of an interactive tex-
tile instrument called Pain Creature. The instrument is
the result of a collaboration between a sonic interaction de-
signer and a textile designer. Through textile and auditory
qualities, Pain Creature explicates different aspects of the
second author’s experience of chronic pain. The instrument
can be used as a tool to reflectively engage with the user’s
pain experiences and as a performance instrument. This
paper introduces the collaborative design process employed
to develop the artifact, focusing on how contributions from
sound design, textile design and movement practice were
combined in the design phase. The paper describes the
technical design of the artifact and discusses how knowledge
from different disciplines affected the development of the
instrument and its use in performance.

1. INTRODUCTION
Embodied musical interfaces have been a popular research
topic in recent years, due to advancements in sensors, e-
textiles and microcontrollers. Embodied instruments have
been employed in new music research to investigate the con-
nection of gesture and sound in the context of dance and
instrumental practice [5, 56]. Novel fabrics and e-textiles
have been extensively used for embodied digital interfaces
in Human-Computer Interaction [46], and they have been
employed in the musical domain to develop interactive cos-
tumes for dance [36, 3, 18] and tactile instrument controllers
[57, 28, 49]. Designing such interfaces often requires collabo-
rating with practitioners such as textile designers, dancers
and movement artists.

The novel textile-embodied interface described in this pa-
per was developed in close collaboration between a sonic
interaction designer (Madaghiele) and an interactive textile
designer (Demir). The artifact is called Pain Creature and
it was designed as part of the doctoral project of the second
author, in which she explores the possibilities of interac-
tive wearable textiles to facilitate somaesthetic awareness of
pain through explicating its qualities [11]. To promote so-
maesthetic awareness, the artifact mediates auditory-touch-
movement interaction promoting improvisational engage-
ments. In the context of the second author’s PhD project,
the artifact is defined as a soma extension that provides self-
reflection regarding pain. In addition to being a self-reflective
tool, the artifact is employed as part of an improvisational
dance performance that was developed by the two authors
of this paper. In the performance, the second author enacts
the experience of pain wearing the artifact, while the first
author generates an electronic sound accompaniment.
Respectively, this paper discusses how the collaboration
between the two authors generated the design of the embod-
ied instrument and its use in performance. The contributions
are: (i) the description of the design process, (ii) the techni-
cal description of a novel textile-embodied interface and (iii)
reflections on how interdisciplinary collaboration affected
the design of the instrument and its use in performance.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Conceptual framing
Pain is an agonizing bodily phenomenon that is inevitable;
for many unfortunate ones pain is chronic, thus, it is part of
their bodily existence. Pain is often seen as a strong physical
disturbance, yet its connection to one’s psychological being
should not be overlooked. In this project, pain is considered
as an embodied phenomenon that is entangled in our somatic
existence. In other words, the experience of pain alters one’s
understanding of self and the world. In phenomenology, the
body is discussed as the source of perception and meaning-
making processes [43, 24]; through our sensing and moving
bodies we can develop new bodily ‘I cans’ in a constant flux
of movement [50].
Somaesthetics argues that improving our somatic - sensory
bodily - knowledge may lead to finding ways of living better
lives in harmony with our bodies [51]. Body awareness in
the context of somaesthetics considers heightening conscious-
ness of bodily sensations and actions for better self-use. In
this work somaesthetics is interpreted to sharpen bodily
consciousness regarding pain, to flourish new bodily under-
standings and self-caring practices. In other words, Pain
Creature - as a soma extension - supports people to reflect
on and develop new living practices about how they exercise,
undertake daily mundane tasks, socialize, etc. with their
bodies in pain. At the same time, the performance of Pain
Creature, which is also presented in this paper, portrays one
of the many ways of moving, living, and being in pain. In the
performance, the second author whose movement capabilities
were influenced by chronic pain continuously discovers new
bodily ‘I cans’ through improvisational movement mediated
by the artifact.
2.2 Embodied musical interfaces
Embodied interactions [16] have been the subject of sev-
eral studies in HCI, with many application to music and
instrument design [60, 7]. Musical embodied interactions
have been explored in different ways, for example through
real-time sonification of biodata [20, 14], sonification of move-
ments [22], or mediated through wearable artefacts such as
interactive costumes [36] and prosthesis [29]. Several sens-
ing methods are available when designing embodied Digital
Musical Instruments (DMIs) [42], such as electromyogra-
phy [21], accelerometers, gyroscopes and flex sensors [54].
Among these, the use of direct sound from microphones can
lead to interesting and complex sonic results. An example
of this technique is the work of Donnarumma [14, 13], in
which direct sound from the body, recorded with condenser
microphones, is used as a material for movement sonification
[13].
Recent advances in fabrication techniques and sensing
methods [33, 46] allowed interactive textiles to be employed
in several musical applications, for example as malleable ob-
jects used as musical controllers [15] and to develop wearable
costumes for interactive dance [53]. In the first case, the
stream of data generated by sensors that detect deformation
of the textile material is used to control musical parame-
ters. Relevant examples include the FabricKeyboard [45],
the Embroidered Musical Ball [58], the felt sensors by Grant
[26], foamin [57] and the Zstretch audio controller [8]. In
the second case, interactive textiles are used to sense move-
ments in dancers and/or gestural information in performing
musicians. The gestural data collected by the interactive
textiles is used in these instances to generate control in-
formation for sound synthesis [9, 36, 18, 52, 47, 17] or to
affect the sound processing of the instrument being played
[49, 61]. Other applications of interactive textiles include
displaying information through audiovisual cues [3] or incor-
porating actuators to augment the performance experience
of the musicians [10, 6] and the audience [34] through haptic
feedback.
In our previous work, we have investigated the use of
contact microphones as sonic interaction devices embedded
in textile garments in two experiments, focusing on the sense-
making process of such interfaces [39] and at their use in
real-time data sonification [38].
2.3 DMI design methods
In this paper, we focus on the collaborative side of our de-
sign process. The design process of DMIs is the subject
of substantial research attention in the NIME community.
Collaborative approaches such as participatory design [23],
pedagogical [55], and practice-based methods [27] have been
employed to involve non-musical practitioners in different
stages of the design process. Collaborating with practition-
ers who are experts in artistic areas such as textile design,
movement and dance has been a way to explore material
properties and develop DMIs with novel qualities [40]: Stew-
art [53] points out that e-textiles can provide sofistication
and nuance in computational audio applications, and Ar-
mitage et al. [1] found that subtlety and detail in instrument
design can emerge from close contact and experimentation
with materials. This is also reported in Zeagler et al.’s
analysis of cross-disciplinary collaboration in the design of
a wearable musical instrument [62]. Additionally, collab-
oration with non-musical practitioners can provide novel
designs on a conceptual level, inspired by the experience of
their specific artistic practice [4].
In this project, we employed soma design [31], a first-
person design method [32] used to design embodied interac-
tions. Soma design offers a theoretical framework and set
of methods that can leverage the expressiveness and aes-
thetic qualities of bodily phenomena and design materials.
In soma design, the design process starts with the design-
ers’ first-person bodily exploration to gain insight into the
bodily phenomenon that they explore to inform the design.
To cultivate subjective bodily insights designers can engage
with somatic practices i.e., yoga, Feldenkrais, dance, etc., or
turn mundane activities like walking strange through slowing
down [31]. This is also referred to as unhabitual movement
engagements [12], moving and making strange [37], and es-
trangement [59] in embodied stances of design. Soma design
has been previously used in the NIME community by Cotton
et al. [10], Martinez-Avila et al. [41] and Bang et al. [2] for
the development of embodied DMIs.
3. DESIGN PROCESS
Chronic pain is a persistent bodily event that is not experi-
enced the same way every day; the intensity or the quality
of it changes. Hence, Pain Creature aims to cultivate the
various temporal qualities of pain to inform the creation of
the soma extension. The design process of Pain Creature
unfolds in two phases: 1) somatic exploration and 2) mate-
rial exploration. The somatic exploration phase unfolds as
the first-person exploration of the second author where she
cultivated her lived experiences of pain to inform the design
of the soma extension. The material exploration phase is a
collaborative process between the two authors that resulted
in the making of the soma extension. The in-depth expla-
nation of this multi-layered design process can be found in
the second author’s dissertation [11]. In this section, we
provide a brief overview of this two-folded design process as
a background for our collaborative making.
3.1 Somatic exploration: autobiographical de-
sign process
The second author is a woman who experiences chronic
upper back pain and she is also a somatic practitioner,
specifically, a certified yoga instructor and an improvisational
dance practitioner. Accordingly, the somatic exploration
phase started with the second author’s improvisational dance
experiment where she moved by listening to her pain and
generating visual-textual documentation of her experience
for a week. She video-recorded each session and noted down
some keywords describing her felt experiences during these
sessions. Upon the completion of the week-long experiment,
she rewatched her video recordings to capture still images
that represent the keywords. To make sense of the visual-
textual documentation, she applied a process similar to
thematic analysis [25] to articulate different qualities of pain,
hence, she gleaned six temporal qualities of pain.
Figure 1 represents the visual mappings of these six pain
qualities 1) Burden, 2) Tectonic Plates, 3) Waves, 4) Warm
Touch, 5) Flesh, and 6) Empty. Burden reflects the heaviness
of pain and its massive existence in the body; Tectonic
Figure 1: Visual maps developed by the second author as part
of the autobiographical documentation process. The qualities
of pain are identified and represented in six different groups:
(1) Burden, (2) Tectonic Plates, (3) Waves, (4) Warm Touch,
(5) Flesh, and (6) Empty.
Plates symbolize the shifting movements of painful parts of
the body; Waves is closer to the relieving aspects of pain
representing the lightness of the body free from pain; Warm
Touch illustrates the feeling of a companion that cares for
the body in pain; Flesh embodies the strong contacts of
bodily materials i.e., muscles, ligaments, and bones; finally,
Empty signifies the body in pain as a disconnected embodied
being.
After formalizing the pain concepts that will be used to
inform the design of the soma extension, the second author
prepared a table ideating on the textile and auditory qualities
of each pain concept that was shared with the first author,
together with the body maps during the material exploration
phase. The keywords used to describe the qualities of pain
are collected in Table 1.

reported in the auto-ethnographic textual documentation.

2. Tectonic Plates Gear Wheels, Mechanical
3. Waves Flow, Exploration
4. Warm Touch Contact, Soft, Gentle
5. Flesh Entangled, Ripping
6. Empty Body, Disconnected
3.2 Material exploration: collaborative design
process
Upon the completion of the somatic exploration phase which
was developed independently by the second author, the
material exploration phase started where both authors col-
laborated on the making of the soma extension. This phase
started with the second author’s presentation of pain con-
cepts to the first author using body map drawings and
keywords as a way to transfer her bodily experience of pain.
The aim of this phase was to create the physical manifesta-
tion of temporal qualities of pain through the use of textile
and auditory materials.
The making process unraveled iteratively where both au-
thors were in constant communication and negotiation; the
sound designs were developed uniquely by the first author,
and the textile designs by the second. However, textile and
sound design influenced each other. Textile materials were
chosen based on their sonic properties and their visual-tactile
qualities. The sonic properties of textile materials were then
employed creatively in sound design. In addition to the tra-
ditional textile materials such as wool, cotton, or polyester
mix yarns, based on the negotiations with the first author,
the second author used non-traditional materials to support
the sound design.
Figure 2: The Pain Creature artifact. The six dimensions
of pain identified through somatic exploration are expressed
in the material exploration phase through five textile arms
with different visual-tactile-auditory qualities. Photography

The sounds of different materials were recorded using
contact microphones and processed on a computer in Pure
Data (PD) [48], and they were later transferred on a Bela
Mini embedded platform [44]. While adapting the sound
designs developed on the computer to run on Bela, it was
necessary to eliminate one of the pain concepts because
the sound design was taking up extensive memory space on
the Bela causing flaws. Since the second author’s doctoral
project is about externalizing pain, the Empty dimension
was excluded. The process of experimenting with materials,
interactions, and sound designs was repeated multiple times
until a satisfactory result was reached. The final result is the
Pain Creature artifact that is worn on the body, representing
five concepts of pain through different visual-tactile-auditory
qualities.
4. IMPLEMENTATION
4.1 System Design
Pain Creature is a wearable artifact that is worn on the back.
The definitive version of the artifact is shown in Figure
2. It consists of one large centerpiece and five different
components - interactive arms - that are connected to the
centerpiece. The centerpiece encompasses electronics and it
is made of a felted polyester-wool mix fabric to carry the
electronic without sagging. Five interactive components are
made of various textile materials and they represent the five
distinct qualities of pain (see section 3.1) 1.
The center piece contains a Bela Mini [44] with a Multi-
channel Expander, which allows for connecting up to eight
audio inputs and eight audio outputs to the Bela. Five piezo-
electric disks used as contact microphones are connected
to different audio inputs of the Bela, one for each textile
arm. The contact microphones are connected to the Bela
audio inputs via a 3.5 mm mono jack; the piezo discs of
each arm can be disconnected individually, such that the
disconnected arm remains silent. The sound output of the
Bela can be listened to from the stereo minijack output of
the Bela with headphones or connected to speakers through
a wireless transmitter. The Bela and the jack plugs are fixed
to the centerpiece using custom-designed 3D printed cases,
which were stitched to the fabric, as shown in Figure 3. The
centerpiece also stores a battery power bank to power the
Bela during usage.
Figure 3: 3D printed cases storing the Bela and the 3.5mm
jack connections inside the centerpiece of the artifact. The
cases are stitched to the centerpiece, securing the Bela and
the jack connections from abrupt movements.
The contact microphones are used both as a source of
sonic material and as touch sensors. A synthesis model is
associated with each textile arm, coded in PD, and run on
the Bela. Each synthesis model takes as input the sound from
the contact microphone in the respective arm and processes
it using different sound design techniques. The amplitude
of each synth sound at any given time is controlled by an
envelope follower applied to the respective piezo sound, such
that the arm is silent when it’s not touched.

4.2 Textile arms
The second author designed five different textile arms, one
for each dimension of Pain described in Table 1. For each of
the textile arms, the authors experimented with how length,
shape, material and touch qualities affect the sonic inter-
action strategies, inspired by the documentation described
in Section 3.1. A signal flow diagram of the instrument is
shown in Figure 4. In this section we describe the design of
each of the arms:
Burden. This arm represents heavy, cumbersome, rough
qualities of Pain. It is made of two parts: 1) the main body
part that is tightly knitted with a light pink elastic and grey
thin polyester yarns and 2) the end part that is knitted with
paper yarns. The piezo disk is stitched to the paper section,
it records the rough sound of the paper in contact with the
body. The paper sound is processed through an adaptive
sample-crushing effect to produce a heavy, distorted digital
sound. This arm stimulates forceful, slow interactions.
Tectonic Plates. This dimension of pain is characterized
by deep and slow, violent evolution. The arm is made of
intricately intertwined ropes of grey and light pink colors.
A small woven sack is attached to one of the ropes. The
sack contains lentils and the piezo disk is woven inside it.
The disk records the sound of the lentils moving as the arm
is touched, providing a scattered sonic texture. This sound
is processed through a low-pass filter and added to a noisy
low-frequency FM synthesizer which is then ring modulated
with a square wave. The performer can interact with this
arm by strongly pulling it and by fiddling with the lentil
sack.
Waves. This is a soothing, flowing expression of pain. It
is characterized by slow exploration and liquid movements.
The arm is composed of a long white tube connected to a
shorter blue one. Both tubes are made of a knitted structure
filled with a spongy material. The contact microphone is
inserted at the end of the longer tube. In this tube the piezo
sound is only used as a touch sensor, to control the volume
of a slowly modulated additive synth, to which a low-passed
noise is added. The additive synth is composed of several
sine wave oscillators tuned to harmonics of 50 Hz, whose
amplitudes and central frequencies are modulated by several
low-frequency noise oscillators. This produces a continuous,
slowly evolving sound.
Warm Touch.This arm represents pain as a mild compan-
ion, a soft, gentle presence. It is made of a long empty
knitted white tube at the end of which a big element is
attached, made of a lump of wadding. Inside this big soft
lump, there is the piezo disk. The piezo sound is used here to
modulate a phase distortion synthesizer, which is then pro-
cessed through a resonant filter to produce a warm, soothing
sound. The lump encourages gentle and nuanced slow touch.
Flesh. Pain is represented here as a stretching, ripping
fleshy entity. It is identified in muscle tissues and bloody,
watery components. This arm is made of thick red yarn to
which lumps of red, orange, and pink yarns are connected.
The piezo disk is inside one of the lumps. Pulling and
touching the arm triggers the sound of an anharmonic FM
synthesizer2, which is combined with a squishy sound pro-
duced by a slowly modulated square wave filtered at random
2The anharmonic FM synth is described in the PD docu-
mentation F11.anharmonicFM
Figure 4: Signal flow diagram of the Pain Creature instrument. When a textile arm is touched, the sound of the corresponding
contact microphone is processed through the respective synthesis algorithm. The piezo adapter is a PD abstraction that allows
to tune the sensitivity of each piezo microphone according to the material and the sound model. The adapter amplifies the
signal according to a predetermined sensitivity value and it extracts the signal’s envelope, as described in [39].
frequencies. The sounds and shape of the arm encourage a
strong pulling interaction.
The piezo microphones react differently to each material,
this requires tuning the signal in PD independently for
each of the arms. The sensitivity of each microphone was
adjusted using an arctangent function as in [39], and a silence
threshold was set for each of the arms. Moreover, the design
of the artifact implies that more than one arm can be used
at the same time. This required tuning the frequencies and
mixing the volumes of the synthesizers to orchestrate the
sound design as they play together.
The sound models were initially prototyped on a computer,
however, the resulting sound designs were too computation-
ally expensive to run in real-time on a Bela as they were.
Therefore, the original sound designs were simplified: it was
necessary to increase the block size on the Bela to 256, mod-
ulation signals are shared among the different sound models
as much as possible, and pre-compiled wavetables are used
instead of generating each oscillator signal individually 3.
5. PERFORMANCE
An interactive dance piece was developed as a collaboration
between the two authors. The performance involves a dancer
(Demir) moving on stage with Pain Creature, and a musician
(Madaghiele) generating an additional layer of electronic
sounds in real time. The additional electronic sounds are
generated from a PD patch on a computer, and controlled
through a MIDI interface. The piece premiered at Vent
Space Gallery in Tallinn (Estonia) and it has an approximate
duration of 20 minutes 4. Pictures from the performance are
shown in Figure 5.
The structure of the performance is composed of four main
sections, each characterized by a different live electronic
accompaniment, during which both performers have room
for improvisation. In the piece, Pain Creature acts as a
complementary actor, a parasite who lives on the body
of the dancer. Throughout the performance, the dancer
explores her relationship to the parasite. The four stages are

4A video excerpt from the performance is available at https:
//zenodo.org/records/11047691
inspired by the second author’s account of her experience of
pain:
1. Discovery: The performance starts with the dancer
lying on the ground, wearing Pain Creature. The
dancer slowly moves to a background of repetitive,
cascading click sounds. The purpose of this phase is in-
troducing the interface to the audience, presenting the
movement-sounds relationship. This section represents
the performer discovering her pain.
2. Conflict: Once the pain is discovered, the performer
struggles to accept it. Her fight with pain is depicted
by snappy movements and a background of crushing
distorted synthesized kick drum sounds.
3. Understanding/Exploration: After fighting pain, the
performer changes her approach and treats it gently,
exploring and understanding it. This section is a solo
of the dancer with Pain Creature, with no additional
electronic sounds. Here she plays with each arm indi-
vidually, unveiling the distinct interaction mappings to
the audience. This section represents understanding
and making peace with pain.
4. Disruption/Iteration: The last section disrupts the
dancer’s acceptance of pain; in this section the Pain
Creature sounds are distorted in real-time through
overdrive and feedback. The dancer, who thought
she had finally understood pain, cannot recognize it
anymore, and she has to start the difficult exploration
process once again.
6. DISCUSSION
6.1 Negotiation between expertises
Dialogical communication between materials and techniques
of textile and sound design led to distinctive interaction
qualities for each arm of Pain Creature. Using contact
microphones to record the real-time sound of the textiles al-
lowed to closely connect material properties to sound designs.
A material’s sonic response can affect users’ perception of it
[35, 30], therefore the sound designs have a complementary
function to touch, inviting or discouraging certain ways of

interacting with the artifact. For example, a longer decay
can invite a gentler touch, while a faster sonic response can
encourage more abrupt interactions.
These negotiations between interaction modalities resulted
in a series of peculiar interaction strategies, such as the small
bag containing lentils in the Tectonic Platesarm, which
provides an engaging tactile experience as well as an interest-
ing sound source. This arm was inspired by the first author’s
experimentation with granular synthesis using the lentils
as a sound source, which was then adopted in the material
design by the second author. In the final version of the
artifact, the granular synthesizer was abandoned, however,
the bag of lentils was maintained as an interaction element
and a sound source. Another instance is the interaction
technique in the Burden arm. This arm is based on the
second author’s experience in knitting paper yarns. The
rough paper surface suggests an energetic touch, providing
a sound source with short attacks and rich high-frequency
responses. Processing these sounds through sample-crushing
complements and invites such forceful interactions, resulting
in a harsh and scattered sonic response, with a fast decay.
A similar strategy was used in the Flesh arm. Here the
objective was stimulating a strong pulling interaction, there-
fore the piezo microphone was incorporated inside a lump of
threads which would produce louder sounds as the arm was
pulled. To encourage pulling, louder sounds were mapped to
increased intensity of the squishy synth and a higher degree
of frequency modulation.
6.2 Performing with Pain Creature
6.2.1 Sonic interaction design
The main focus during the design of the interface was on
movement improvisation, aiming for an intuitive, immediate
response of sound to touch. For this reason, explicit musical
parameter controls have not been integrated into the artifact,
limiting its possibilities of sonic variations. As expected,
this allows the performer to focus on movement improvisa-
tion while still shaping the sounds intuitively in real time.
However, this aspect can be a significant limitation when
performing, since the sound designs are relatively static and
they leave few opportunities for conscious control of musical
properties to the dancer. This means that in performance
the Pain Creature sounds need to be integrated with an ac-
companiment of additional electronic sounds, otherwise the
sonic aspect of the piece can be perceived as too repetitive
for an act of medium-long duration.
6.2.2 Gesture-to-sound interpretability
In the piece, the artifact is presented as a materialization of
the dancer’s pain, a mysterious physical entity that commu-
nicates through abstract sonic responses. A crucial aspect
for the narrative of the piece is the ability of the audience to
distinguish the sounds emitted by the artifact in relation to
the dancer’s movement from the sounds that are introduced
as an accompaniment. This is a habitual concern when
presenting any novel DMIs to an audience [19], as the inter-
pretability of gesture-to-sound mappings is a fundamental
component of a musical performance; in this case, this is
specifically relevant since the artifact undertakes a narrative
role in the piece. It was not possible to investigate the degree
to which this distinction was understood by the audience
within the scope of this paper, however a future study with
audience interviews could provide interesting insights for the
development of new interactive performances of this kind.
7. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presents a novel textile-musical interface for im-
provisational dance and sound-making. Pain Creature was
designed as a collaborative work between a sonic interac-
tion designer and an interactive textile designer. The paper
describes the design method employed to develop the instru-
ment, the techniques that were used for tactile interactions,
and the performance strategies employed in an interactive
dance piece.
Overall, Pain Creature provides a successful example of
collaborative work between practitioners of different artistic
disciplines, deeply integrating expertise from textile design,
sound design, and improvisational dance. The interface pro-
vides interesting possibilities for improvisational movement,
self-exploration, and self-expression through sound making.
Future work could entail researching interpretability through
audience interviews and further integration of musical pa-
rameters in textile interfaces, investigating how to increase
user control over the sonic material without sacrificing intu-
itiveness.
