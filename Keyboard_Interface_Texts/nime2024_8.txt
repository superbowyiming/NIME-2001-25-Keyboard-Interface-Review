ABSTRACT
This research project aims to address the challenges faced
by children with autism spectrum condition (ASC) by de-
veloping a collaborative and accessible digital musical in-
terface (CADMI) through a participatory design (PD) pro-
cess. Six PD workshops were conducted in collaboration
with Stanbridge Academy (n=6) and Skolen Sputnik (n=6),
incorporating fictional inquiry narratives and tailored non-
digital activities. The resulting musical tablet app, ‘ box-
sound’, prioritizes the user’s perspective and enables the
practice of various social skills by bridging divergent view-
points. The CADMI was evaluated through a survey and
semi-structured interviews with both children with autism
and their educators.

1. INTRODUCTION
Worldwide it is estimated that one out of 100 children has
autism spectrum condition (ASC) [31]. Autism is a diverse
neurodevelopmental condition that can have a large effect
on the physical and/or mental well-being of people with
autism—common challenges faced are social interactions

due to lack of emotional regulations [23], communication
difficulties [20], repetitive patterns of behaviour [43]. There-
fore, individuals with autism often encounter obstacles in
everyday activities, such as engaging in social interactions
and participating in collaborative leisure pursuits. Exten-
sive research has indicated that evidence-based psychologi-
cal interventions [32] can offer a quality of life improvement
for individuals with autism, including more enjoyable social
interactions [3, 34, 24] and an anxiety reduction [4].
This research explores and reflects upon the implemen-
tation of a participatory design (PD) process [36] involv-
ing two special educational needs (SEN) schools. We ex-
plore how PD can be applied to create a collaborative ac-
cessible digital musical interface (CADMI) [18] for children
with ASC to facilitate collaboration and cooperative play
among them, focusing on awareness of others and collab-
orative play. Research suggests that facilitating collabora-
tion through technology for children with ASC is a well-
established method [44]. We connect the significance of
established music therapy [14, 21, 15, 13] and movement
therapy [35, 38, 29] interventions to the role of collabora-
tive social development and aim further to investigate this
through a collaborative, exploratory PD process.
When working with children with neurodiversity, various
factors, such as unequal power dynamics, diverse means of
expressing ideas, and the involvement of multiple stakehold-
ers, including parents, teachers, and caregivers, contribute
to a complex context that necessitates a balanced and em-
pathetic approach to design work. Drawing upon the exist-
ing literature, we utilise a participatory action research [41]
approach with a fictional inquiry [6] narrative to facilitate
active participation. We attempted to minimize distrac-
tions by utilizing non-digital activities, inspired by Hand-
lungspielraum [27] and the IDEAS framework [1].
The design process culminates in the creation ofboxsound
a tablet-app prototype that is grounded in theory and in-
corporates the diverse interdisciplinary perspectives of stu-
dents, teachers, and academic professionals [33].
The main contributions of this participatory action re-
search project are: (1) Detailing of the process of co-creating
a CADMI prototype. (2) Interaction design paradigms for
creating a shareable interface rooted in collaborative play
methods and movement synchrony for children with ASC.
(3) Insights from both children with ASC and their teachers
on the effectiveness of a CADMI in an SEN setting.
2. RELATED WORK
2.1 Collaboration Through Technology for Chil-
dren with ASC
Yuill’s Co-EnACT Collaboration Framework expands early
theoretical perspectives on how social interactions shape
children’s development, proposing that the Vygotskian view
of cultural artifacts shaping children’s mental development
can be connected to modern digital technology’s impact on
their advancement [42, 44]. Robinson et al.’s research on
engagement in cooperative play defines five categories of
participation in play, namely: solitary, onlooker, parallel-
aware, associative, and cooperative. Additionally, Hornecker
et al.’s notion of shareable capacities of technology can be
used to identify points of transition between these fluid lev-
els of participation [17]. These shareable capacities can be
summarized into entry points, how a technology can invite
interaction, and access points, how a technology invites in-
dividuals to interact with a group activity. These concepts
offer insights into design affordances that minimize barriers
to entry, offer diverse access, and maximize the fluidity of
sharing, Hornecker et al.’s final access point needed in true
collaboration where individual contributions are not nec-
essarily distinguishable. Structure and constraint—or lack
thereof—can morph ownership into a collaborative engage-
ment [17].
2.2 Accessible Digital Musical Interfaces (AD-
MIs) for Children with ASC
Accessible Digital Musical Instruments (ADMIs), which en-
tail specifically designed and customized DMIs created to
allow the accessible use of digital music technology. In a
recent review on ADMIs, Frid [12] finds that the use of
music technology in music therapy contexts has seen an
increased focus as of 2019. 8.4% of the reviewed ADMIs
had ASC user groups as their target population. She notes
that ASC children may exhibit both hypo- and hypersensi-
tivity to sensory stimuli, including differences in tolerance
for hues and frequency bands that are outside the average
range. Thus, suggesting that ADMIs designed for children
with ASC should be considerate of each individual’s specific
sensory sensitivities.
Based on the discovered research, most ADMIs created
for ASC predominantly utilize tangible user interfaces (TUIs),
sometimes in combination with a multisensory environment.
The Reactable by Jord` a et al. [19] offers an intuitive TUI for
the collaborative creation of musical soundscapes. During
a later study with nine ASC children [39], it was found to
increase turn-taking behavior, suggesting the use of physi-
cal objects as a critical factor when facilitating interchanges
and interactions with technological systems. Nonnis et al.
developed Mazi [30], a TUI that employs haptic and au-
ditory stimulation to encourage spontaneous and collabo-
rative play among ASC children. A five-week study with
five ASC children aged between 6 and 9 years found that
collaborative play emerged from the interaction with the
system.
F¨orster et al. [7] developed two ADMIs designed for
ASC children: SnoeSky, an interactive installation in the
form of a starry sky that integrates into the ceiling of a
Snoezel-Room (a therapeutic and controlled multisensory
environment), allowing users to “play” with “melodic con-
stellations” using a flashlight, and SonicDive, an ADMI
installation that enables users to explore a complex wa-
ter soundscape through their movement inside a ball pool.
These ADMIs attempted to promote both relaxation and
self-efficacy experiences, facilitated by a direct, and intu-
itive relationship between motion and sound. However, a
desire for increased variation and complexity in the sound
creation was expressed—as the SonicDive did not engender
prolonged interactions. A combination of multisensory and
TUI can also be found in BendableSound by Cibrian et al.
[5], a system that facilitates neurological music therapy to
improve the sensorimotor regulation of ASC children. Their
prototype utilizes an elastic multisensory surface that plays
sounds when touched. A formative study with 18 teachers
found that BendableSound was both a usable and attractive
method for interactive technological music therapy.
Within a multisensory environment, Lobo et al. [26] cre-
ated a mobile system designed to support music therapists
in teaching socio-communicative behaviors to children with
ASC. Chimelight offers the capability to track and evaluate
the movement during usage—delivering metrics to quantify
specific target behaviours. A case evaluation study with
nine ASC children between five and fifteen years old found
Chimelight increased engagement and decreased targeted
negative behaviors.
Previous work has focused on extending collaboration as
a critical aspect of the development of ADMIs. The de-
velopment of DuoRhythmo, a system that empowers people
living with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (PALS) to cre-
ate music collaboratively in real-time, and the introduction
of the term Collaborative Accessible Digital Musical Inter-
face (CADMI) highlighted the significance of cooperation in
creating meaningful technological experiences for accessible
music-making situations [18].
2.3 Participatory Action Research with Chil-
dren with ASC
Children with ASC have a breadth of diverse lived experi-
ences and varying communication needs, preferences, and
strengths. Therefore, adaptable data collection methods
must be used to more accurately represent the child with
ASC’s contribution to the PD process. Ward et al. [41] ar-
gue that such an approach allows for a deeper understanding
of the collaborative process and promotes a more inclusive
design that better accommodates the needs and preferences
of individuals with ASC.
PD offers a framework for working with marginalized
groups often excluded from design processes [36]. Children
with ASC are often subject to exclusion due to communica-
tion barriers and varied social abilities and preferences [2].
To better understand the value of participation, we seek to
establish a collaborative, iterative PD process, drawing in-
spiration from Research through Design (RtD) [11] that in-
cludes children with ASC during the entire process. Accord-
ing to Zimmermann et al., [45], RtD is a forward-looking
methodology that aims to enhance the world through dis-
ruptive innovations that challenge and transform the status
quo. In conjunction with PD, this research practice em-
phasizes the importance of having an emphatic and inclu-
sive connection with stakeholders, requiring researchers to
be present and attentive to the needs, desires, and aspira-
tions of those affected by the innovations being developed.
Makhaeva et al. suggests the concept of Handlungspiel-
raum, a conceptual space in which creative co-design activi-
ties occur and emphasizes the importance of tailored condi-
tions that enable the flexible exploration of the creative po-
tentials of co-designers [27]. Kender et al. [22] propose em-
ploying diverse creative modes, such as Storyteller, Scien-
tist, Actor, and Explorer, to involve children as co-designers
in PD, prioritizing their needs and strengths. This approach
encourages children’s active participation and engagement
in the creative brainstorming process through fictional in-
quiry. A significant branch of PD research is participatory
action research, which aims ”to encourage its co-designers to
determine and critically evaluate a range of open (and per-
haps non-design specific) issues if action research principles
are used” [8]. Notable PD research projects include Benton
et al.’s use of PD principles in the creation of the IDEAS
framework as a method to involve children with ASC in the
technology design process [1] and Frauenberger et al. exten-
sion of traditional research-based methods in its framework
by offering a model to incorporate more context, designers’
knowledge, and personal information about participants in
the PD process [10].
3. METHODS
This project consisted of four principal components, namely:
(1) introductory user research workshops (URW), (2) par-
ticipatory design workshops (PDW) utilizing fictional in-
quiry, (3) evaluation case study with children with ASD
assisted by their teachers, and (4) interviews with special
educational needs (SEN) educators.
The iterative Participatory Design (PD) process involved
two special needs education school classes as co-designers.
During the URWs, we established an understanding and
connection with our co-designers, using the IDEAS frame-
work [1]. Based on the URW findings we further developed
our methods framework to include participatory action re-
search [41] combined with fictional inquiry [6]. The pro-
cess was guided by the concept of Handlungspielraum [27],
utilizing diverse creative modes [22] to create a conceptual
space for creative co-design activities. Aiming to create an
inclusive and empathetic connection with stakeholders, ac-
commodating diverse needs, preferences, and strengths of
individuals with ASC.
As part of our research, the students with ASC act as
co-designers. We developed both workshop activities and
design ideas iteratively and envelope them in an overarch-
ing narrative throughout the project phase. Using prox-
ies in a PD process is a well-established method especially
when collaborating with children. We draw on Moraveji et
al.’s narrative framework [28] to immerse the co-design pro-
cess in a futuristic narrative. Our narrative engages the co-
designers in continuous roleplay throughout the workshop
sessions, aiming to tap into their creativity, playfulness, and
imagination to achieve a specific common goal and purpose.
In a collaborative PD process, it is essential to shape the
context of design workshop activities suggested by Dindler
et al. [6]. Considering the diverse communication and col-
laboration preferences and abilities of children with ASC, a
fictional inquiry framework could help bring together and
onboard participants in the design process.
Despite following best practices, several difficulties in fa-
cilitating collaboration and participation in design activities
were experienced in the URWs, leading to adjustments in
subsequent workshops. Our study employs a user-centered
PD process to develop a movement and audio-based expe-
rience to promote social abilities such as non-verbal com-
munication and collaborative play. During a consultation
with SEN teachers of both schools, we found potential in
pursuing the design of a collaborative accessible digital mu-
sical instrument (CADMI) to empower children with ASC
to engage in shared musical experiences. The prototype is
designed for children with ASD in SEN schools as a “brain
break” in between lectures, a concept suggested by the SEN
teacher of Stanbridge Academy.
The prototype is evaluated through a case study with
ASD children. The perceived engagement, functionality,
and aesthetics during the case study are evaluated using the
Mobile Application Rating Scale: user version (uMARS)
[37]. While the uMARS scale did challenge the co-designers
in terms of reading and rating each question, it was found by
the SEN teachers to be the most likely method to produce
some reflection and results from the participants. We made
sure to allow for ample time to fill out the questionnaire
and assisted in ensuring a thorough understanding of the
question wording and answer options for the participants.
Additionally, the effectiveness of the experience in enhanc-
ing social abilities is evaluated based on a post-interview
with the SEN teachers.
4. USER RESEARCH WORKSHOPS (URW)
AT STANBRIDGE ACADEMY
October - November 2022, San Mateo, California
The motivation for the URW conducted at Stanbridge
Academy was to gain initial design insights as well as first-
hand experience in working with neurodiverse children co-
designers. We collaborated with a high school music pro-
duction class, consisting of seven children with ASC. Follow-
ing Benton et al.’s IDEAS framework [1], we organized three
workshops at Stanbridge Academy: (1) Introductions and
observation of preferred teaching methods, (2) Ice-breakers
and brainstorming, and (3) Experimenting with several ex-
isting ADMIs.
4.1 Insights from URW
We applied playful PD methods to help the co-designers
shift into a more creative mindset, which appeared to help
some co-designers engage more deeply. The key takeaways
from the URW were:
• Understanding the Target Group: Observing partic-
ipants’ interactions and responses informed our un-
derstanding of their capabilities and needs, shaping
subsequent workshop designs.
• Facilitating Creativity and Playfulness: We empha-
sized fostering a creative mindset among co-designers.
This exercise promoted creative thinking, highlight-
ing the role of playful and imaginative activities in
overcoming barriers posed by disabilities. We learned
that it is essential to be adaptable in terms of the ASC
participants’ needs, desires, and energy levels,
• Digital Music Workshops: We presented collaborative
and individual digital music experiences like Shared
Piano and Melody Maker by Chrome Music Lab. Co-
designers favored the quick generation of musical ideas,
highlighting the potential for both collaboration and
individual expression.
Contextualizing the design challenge is crucial for engag-
ing co-designers, helping them gauge the feasibility of pre-
sented ideas. Introducing existing digital musical experi-
ences enabled them to comprehend the project’s potential,
inspiring creative contributions. Feedback and observations
enhanced our understanding of participants’ abilities and in-
terests, guiding future workshop designs. Recognizing chal-
lenges, like the use of open-ended questions, and lack of
structure for active engagement, prompted adjustments in
subsequent workshops.
5. PARTICIPATORY DESIGN WORKSHOPS
(PDW) AT SKOLEN SPUTNIK
April-June 2023, Copenhagen, Denmark
The structure of the PDW was designed to actively lever-
age the co-design processes and participatory prototyping.
Through tech demo sessions and design thinking role-play
sessions, the workshops aimed to provide a platform for the
children to express their opinions in a supportive environ-
ment.
Participation in the workshops was voluntary, and teach-
ers selected a class with expected enthusiasm for the re-
search. The school’s flexible participation approach meant
anticipating four to six co-designers per session. Conse-
quently, we devised an adaptable workshop structure to ac-
commodate varying participation levels each day.
5.1 Workshop 1: Context Setting
We focused on crafting a narrative structure, influenced by
insights from relevant literature on conducting workshops
with neurodiverse children. Drawing on previous work [27,
28], an introductory pre-recorded video set the narrative
tone, followed by three technological experiences and a writ-
ten reflection task. To minimize disruptions, the session
avoided external screens and technologies.
A purpose-designed pamphlet aligned with the narrative
served as a guide for participants, outlining the day’s agenda,
narrative details, and reflective writing tasks. Post-technology
demonstrations, participants engaged in written reflections,
enhancing the feedback process. A roleplay session, pre-
ceded by a superhero mask exercise 1, led to the generation
of three collaborative musicking conceptual design ideas,
with a heightened focus on time management.
The tech demo segment featured demonstrations of audio
technologies—PatchXR2, Koala Sampler 3, and DatoDuo4.
Evaluation sheets and an open discussion unveiled vary-
ing participant engagement, providing valuable insights into
their perceptions of the technologies. Following a break, co-
designers assumed fictional characters, presented as cards,
but encountered challenges in roleplaying, necessitating in-
creased facilitation by the workshop conductor. With sup-
port, a compelling conversation ensued, leading to the con-
ceptualization of four ideas.
1. Online: An environment where you could tap in and
out of other people’s soundscapes with some form of
voting-based selection to choose the current main sound.
2. Screen: Shared screen experience through turn-taking
and exploration together.
3. Headphones: Having the possibility to access and con-
trol sound virtually. “AirDrums”playing in the air and
making sounds just for yourself.
4. Movement: Making sounds with your body as a “hid-
den” way to get exercise.
5.1.1 Results
In the first PDW session, insights from the URW were ap-
plied to enhance inclusivity in co-designer participation.
The superhero mask activity served as an effective icebreaker,
1https://gamestorming.com/ice-breaker/
2https://patchxr.com/
3https://www.koalasampler.com/
4https://dato.mu/
fostering enthusiastic engagement in the tech demonstra-
tion. Notably, collaboration around the DatoDuo was a
standout, showcasing seamless role-switching and participa-
tory musicking. Stations for DatoDuo and PatchXR offered
diverse experiences, with the former attracting collaborative
play.
Despite the success of the tech demo, the brainstorming
phase encountered challenges due to its open-ended nature.
Co-designers expressed confusion and the need for clearer
tasks and guidelines, as exemplified by one participant’s
uncertainty about embodying the assigned character. In
the reflection session, T1 introduced a collaborative iPad
streaming idea, leading to discussions on split-screen inter-
faces, competition, voting, and the integration of personal
vocal samples. The importance of clear guidelines for ef-
fective ideation was underscored, with the split-screen con-
cept and personal vocal sample integration gaining interest
among co-designers.
5.2 Workshop 2: Prototyping
Before the second workshop, insights from the first session
were synthesized into design goals, with a focus on enhanc-
ing collaboration through movement. Inspired by discus-
sions following the PDW1 tech demo, a hypothesis emerged
to incorporate a form of bodily movement into the expe-
rience. S1 expressed interest in an experience that subtly
encouraged movement, particularly as he was not keen on
physical activities.
The project’s initial phases pondered the setting, context,
duration, and participants for the experience. Drawing from
URW data, the concept of a “brain break” was chosen. SEN
teachers often faced motivational challenges, and Teacher
1 (T1) highlighted his students’ limited physical activities.
A “brain break” aimed to offer co-designers a rejuvenating
experience, providing an opportunity to recharge. T1 em-
phasized the importance of easy entry and exit from the
experience.
Exploring the integration of body movements into mu-
sic creation, the team recognized the potential of embodied
control for musical parameters as a playful approach aligned
with movement therapy principles. Noting co-designers’ en-
joyment of the sampler in the first workshop, three partic-
ipatory prototyping exercises were designed. These exer-
cises investigated collaboration, natural embodied gestures
for sonic parameter changes, and showcased an extension of
the sampler app from PDW1 called Tone Transfer 5.
5.2.1 Design of Prototypes
To explore collaboration through a cardboard prototype,
inspired by a gesture elicitation study, we aimed to observe
co-designers reaching a consensus on a shared gesture-based
command for sound control. Using a rectangular box with
painted buttons emulating a shareable touch interface, the
prototype employed a split-screen interaction paradigm dis-
cussed in PDW1. Co-designers, by holding and pressing
buttons, collaboratively adjusted parameters while generat-
ing audio snippets with Ableton Learn Synth Playground 6.
For the phone prototype, we sought to validate assump-
tions about incorporating physical movement and using move-
ment as an embodied sonic parameter controller. In Unity 7
with ChucK8 for audio, the low-fidelity prototype utilized
5https://sites.research.google/tonetransfer/
6https://learningsynths.ableton.com/
7https://unity.com/
8https://chuck.stanford.edu/
the phone’s accelerometer to alter audio effect parameters
in a musical loop along the X, Y, and Z axes.
Drawing from the methodology of a gesture elicitation
study by Wobbrock et al. [40], we assessed both prototypes.
Co-designers proposed gesture-based commands to trigger
specific effects, aligning with the study’s approach to de-
signing movement-based interactions. Notably, Leng et al.
found limited user agreement when defining sonic gestures
in gestural interface design for music interaction, emphasiz-
ing the complexity of defining such interactions [25].
5.2.2 Results
The Tone Transfer application showcased during the work-
shop revealed the co-designers’ creativity and expressive-
ness, with participants enjoying collaborative sound cre-
ation using various props. The phone prototype, employ-
ing embodied interaction techniques, intrigued co-designers
as they transformed body movements into sound effects.
However, they encountered challenges with slow response
times and suggested improvements for clearer instructions
and faster feedback. Co-designers brainstormed collabora-
tive features, including freezing beats and recording voices
for musical compositions.
The cardboard prototype, simulating digital sound recre-
ation, prompted creative and adaptive approaches, with
some co-designers expressing a desire for more communi-
cation time. Emphasizing the importance of an inclusive
environment, the workshop received positive feedback from
SEN teachers, indicating its success in meeting co-designers’
needs and fostering a supportive learning environment. The
workshop’s appropriate length and the novelty of the re-
search team’s visit contributed to co-designers’ engagement
and a positive learning experience.
5.3 Workshop 3: Case Study
16th of May 2023, Copenhagen, Denmark
The goal of this session was to understand the impact
and evaluate the created prototype in a contextualized sce-
nario. Once the co-designers were familiarised with the pro-
totype, we introduced the narrative concept of creating a
time capsule. The goal was to record and share this capsule
in the future, enabling the role-playing narrative introduced
in PDW1. The recording of the soundscape to be sent in the
time capsule narrative served as a culmination of the work-
shop. To assess the effectiveness of the case study, we uti-
lized an adapted version of the uMARS questionnaire. Ad-
ditionally, we conducted a semi-structured interview with
the two SEN teachers. The interview explored the poten-
tial relevance of incorporating a prototype-like product into
their regular school day.
5.3.1 Design Concept
To prepare for the third workshop, an analysis of insights
from the second workshop was conducted. This synthesis
aimed to distill the knowledge into tangible design goals.
The evaluation of the phone prototype highlighted the im-
portance of swift and responsive sonic feedback and the need
for more obvious sound effects for embodied sonic explo-
ration. The cardboard box exercise confirmed that a share-
able tool for modulating sound effects could be enjoyable
for the co-designers, but the challenge lies in translating
that enjoyment to a sharable iPad interface. Clearly de-
fined separate play areas and intuitively designed controls
for simultaneous interaction are essential. Inspired by the
success of the ToneTransfer demo, implementing an intu-
itive and performative live sampler and looper is necessary.
Individual controls should be provided to allow co-designers
to tweak their recordings and shape them into pleasant and
musical sounds.
5.3.2 Design and Implementation
To effectively cater to a digitally native target group, a
high-fidelity prototype with attention to detail is crucial.
Friendly and playful colors and shapes might establish an
emotional connection with the co-designers, enhancing their
engagement and ownership towards the interface. A retro-
futuristic aesthetic for the audio-visualiser was selected to
tie the interface into the PD process narrative. Further-
more, the design language could highlight the interface’s
resemblance to musical devices, featuring instrument-like
visual cues that promote familiarity.
When designing the high-fidelity interface GUI, the chal-
lenge was to provide an intuitive metaphor for shareable
interactions. The prototype was designed for four people’s
collaboration, utilizing the iPad’s physical capabilities and
assigning one player to each corner. Individual play areas
and the ergonomic layout of controls were prioritized. The
recording button, a key interaction, was placed prominently
in the corner for easy reach. Dedicated colors were assigned
to each corner to enhance ownership and distinguish roles.
Touch-controlled knobs and sliders were used for effect con-
trols, placed within reach of one finger while holding the
iPad.
The prototype’s audio engine utilized live sampling. The
mechanics of effects were adjusted based on co-designers’
feedback, ensuring swift and responsive sound changes. In-
dividual effect controls allowed co-designers to tailor their
recordings and take ownership of their sonic expressions.
Three effects were implemented: playback rate, volume, and
a low-pass filter. An audio-visualizer provided comprehen-
sive visual feedback of the playing sonic field Figure 1. All
of these design elements were incorporated into the creation
of the boxsound prototype, so named by one of the PDW
co-designers.
5.3.3 Evaluation
In a case study at Skolen Sputnik involving four co-designers
with ASC, two SEN teachers, and two researchers, the pro-
totype’s functionalities were introduced at a round table.
The co-designers explored recording voiceovers, focusing on
spoken sounds, internet memes, and unconventional sounds.
After a shift in approach and the departure of one co-designer,
they incorporated device movement to add effects to the
soundscape, with close proximity posing a challenge for
some. Creating a rhythmic composition using various ob-
jects and non-verbal vocals, co-designers adjusted pitch,
tempo, and volume to shape the mood.
The recording session concluded with co-designers hold-
ing the device together, instinctively moving in different di-
rections to synchronize with the evolving soundscape. Ex-
pressing fascination, one co-designer remarked, ”It sounds
like we are walking into another dimension!” Following the
session, a group review of the questionnaire allowed each
co-designer to reflect and provide feedback on engagement,
functionality, aesthetics, and subjective quality. R2 and T1
guided the process, adapting the questionnaire for the appli-
cation. Table 1 displays individually calculated and average
scores of the uMARS subscales for App Quality.
In the follow-up interview with the teachers, we aimed
to gain insights into their perspectives on using the proto-
type as an app during school breaks. Initially, they found
Figure 1: The audio-visualiser component in its default state (left) and in different stages reacting to various sounds
the app’s features captivating, with T1 noting it could be
a fun conversation starter tool. T2 emphasized the chal-
lenges children with ASC face in interaction and communi-
cation. This led to discussing the possibility of including a
music teacher or therapist to guide the co-designers in ex-
ploring sounds and understanding musical composition. T2
also highlighted the importance of intrinsic motivation and
shared goals in engaging co-designers, suggesting that either
a clear motivation to create music or a structured environ-
ment with a facilitator could enhance the experience. T1
suggested recreating a favorite song together as a goal, while
T2 proposed distributing roles or creating sound stations to
make it easier for co-designers to participate.
6. DISCUSSION
6.1 Usability Considerations
The participatory design (PD) process for ”boxsound” fol-
lowed an iterative approach, incorporating insights from
therapeutic practices and collaborative technology theories.
The URW provided valuable insights into effective approaches
for involving children with ASC in the design process. The
PDWs established a robust framework for conceptualizing a
prototype aimed at fostering social, collaborative, and com-
munication abilities.
The prototype demonstrated commendable functionality
and received positive feedback from co-designers and teach-
ers. The user interface was intuitive, and response times
were generally satisfactory, minimizing frustration. How-
ever, identified areas for improvement include the accuracy
of the recording button, refinement of effects, the inclusion
of a play/pause or global mute option, and the need for
clearer guidance in creating specific scenarios for sound cor-
ners. Additionally, suggestions were made for features like
export/save functionality and an import mode.
6.2 Collaboration and Movement for Children
with ASC
The conceptual goal was to facilitate collaboration through
a shareable interface and movement synchrony. The iPad’s
design allowed simultaneous multiplayer action, enabling
co-located collaboration. The interface design with indi-
vidual play areas facilitated simultaneous co-located collab-
oration, and co-designers understood and used the proto-
type accordingly. However, a more explicit collaboration
metaphor or guided collaboration approach might have en-
hanced engagement, especially for those lacking intrinsic
motivation.
The absence of a guided collaboration metaphor extended
to the movement aspect. Co-designers showed limited in-
clination to adjust sonic parameters with body movements,
indicating the need for a more constrained collaboration
model or the involvement of a music/movement therapist to
enhance the exploratory approach. The current exploratory
collaboration might be more suitable for participants with
shared composition goals or additional musical experience.
6.3 Challenges with Shareable Interface
Using the iPad as a shareable interface posed challenges,
as some co-designers were not close friends, leading to dis-
comfort when physically close. The suggestion to avoid si-
multaneous physical contact with the device resonates with
concerns about the potential intimidation it might pose for
some co-designers in this specific group.
The examination of usability considerations and collabo-
ration aspects provides insights into the strengths and po-
tential enhancements for the “boxsound” prototype. Ad-
dressing identified areas for improvement and considering
a guided collaboration model could optimize the experience
for children with ASC. The challenges with the shareable in-
terface highlight the importance of tailoring design choices
to the comfort and preferences of the specific user group.
6.4 Key Insights from Conducting Participa-
tory Action Research Methodology
Participatory action research in the development of uncon-
ventional technological prototypes demands adaptability and
compromise. Holone et al. [16] stress the importance of
shared vocabularies, trust-building, addressing communi-
cation barriers, and empowering co-designers with ASC in
decision-making. Our workshop sessions often deviated from
expectations, emphasizing the difficulties in empowering all
neurological diverse participants to contribute [9].
User research workshops (URW) prepared us to engage
effectively with co-designers with ASC, using introduction
games to build trust and embracing Handlungspielraum prin-
ciples [27]. Specific strategies, including a structured envi-
ronment, visual supports, and clear communication, aligned

Stanbridge Academy, such as the impact of workshop timing
on engagement, informed adaptations for planning sessions
with Skolen Sputnik.
Collecting feedback from children with ASC involved flex-
ibility [27, 41]. Initially, open-ended questions yielded lim-
ited responses, leading to a narrative-based approach in-
spired by Moraveeji et al. [28]. A fictional narrative, fea-
turing roleplaying cards and a recorded video, contextual-
ized the workshops. However, the complexity of combin-
ing roleplaying and design thinking overwhelmed some co-
designers. In response, we refined the narrative approach,
simplifying the roleplaying element to reduce cognitive de-
mands while maintaining contextualization [41].
7. CONCLUSION
This research project focuses on addressing challenges faced
by children with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) by de-
veloping a Collaborative Accessible Digital Musical Inter-
face (CADMI) through a Participatory Design (PD) pro-
cess. The objective is to foster collaboration, cooperative
work, and communication skill development among chil-
dren with ASC through a technological musical co-creation
prototype, boxsound. Employing a participatory action re-
search approach, the project utilizes fictional inquiry nar-
ratives and non-digital activities, adapting continuously to
harness the unique strengths of individuals with ASC. The
primary contributions include the collaborative creation of
the CADMI prototype, the introduction of interaction de-
sign paradigms grounded in collaborative play methods through
shareable interfaces, and insights from SEN teachers and
children with ASC regarding the prototype’s effectiveness
in a SEN school setting.
In summary, this project provided valuable insights into
technology co-creation for children with ASC, emphasizing
collaboration, communication, and social development. In-
tegrating theoretical foundations, participatory design ap-
proaches, and interdisciplinary perspectives contributes to
the knowledge base in PD and CADMI, aiming to enhance
the lives of children with ASC and inspire future research
endeavors.
