ABSTRACT
Many digital musical instrument design frameworks have
been proposed that are well suited for analysis and compari-
son. However, not all provide applicable design suggestions,
especially where subtle, important details are concerned.
Using traditional lutherie as a model, we conducted a se-
ries of interviews to explore how violin makers “go beyond
the obvious”, and how players perceive and describe subtle
details of instrumental quality. We ﬁnd that lutherie frame-
works provide clear design methods, but are not enough to
make a ﬁne violin. Success comes after acquiring suﬃcient
tacit knowledge, which enables detailed craft through sub-
jective, empirical methods. Testing instruments for sub-
tle qualities was suggested to be a diﬀerent skill to play-
ing. Whilst players are able to identify some speciﬁc details
about instrumental quality by comparison, these are often
not actionable, and important aspects of“sound and feeling”
are much more diﬃcult to describe. In the DMI domain,
we introduce the term NIMEcraft to describe subtle dif-
ferences between otherwise identical instruments and their
underlying design processes, and consider how to improve
the dissemination of NIMEcraft.

1. INTRODUCTION
Many taxonomies of digital musical instruments (DMIs)
have been proposed, considering modes of interaction [16],
number and types of inputs and outputs, mappings from
action to sound [11], and relation to traditional instruments
[30]. Like classical orchestration textbooks, these taxonomies
can provide structured comparison between the form, func-
tion and usage of diﬀerent instruments.

.
In this paper, we draw attention to aspects of DMI design
which are not captured by taxonomies. This concerns ﬁne
aspects of craftsmanship that distinguish great instruments
from mediocre ones. We use the neologism NIMEcraft to
describe these subtle, subjective qualities. A further deﬁni-
tion is given in Section 2.3, but consider two violins as an
example: a Stradivarius and a factory-made student violin.
According to most taxonomies (and indeed, most orchestra-
tion textbooks), these instruments are nearly identical in
size, interaction mode, controls, mapping, and pitch range.
Nonetheless, nuances in sound and tactile response will re-
sult in vastly diﬀerent experiences for professional violinists.
Just as master luthiers possess years of accumulated knowl-
edge in crafting ﬁne violins, many experienced electronic
instrument designers in NIME and in industry have devel-
oped detailed personal practices to produce highly-reﬁned
instruments. Some have shared personal reﬂections on their
design practices in papers [5] or interviews [7]. However, re-
search papers at NIME and similar venues do not provide
a full account of craft knowledge. Some aspects of craft
are personal, subjective and inherently nonscientiﬁc; other
aspects, like the tacit knowledge of a master craftsperson,
may not be fully communicable in writing at all.
The next section of this paper explores the coverage and
potential gaps of NIME frameworks and taxonomies, lead-
ing to the introduction of the NIMEcraft concept. The pa-
per then presents ﬁndings from structured interviews with
luthiers and violinists exploring issues of craft in that in-
strumental domain. The ﬁnal discussion highlights oppor-
tunities and challenges for the NIME community in sharing
NIMEcraft knowledge which may not easily ﬁt the param-
eters of typical publications.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 NIME frameworks
In his inﬂuential 2001 paper, Cook concludes the descrip-
tion of his DMI design principles by stating that “musical
interface construction proceeds as more art than science,
and possibly this is the only way that it can be done” [5].
Since then, a multitude of NIME frameworks have been
published to aid designers, a full review of which is beyond
the scope of this paper. An excellent overview is provided
by O’Modhrain [23], who states that they “serve to system-
atize thinking and promote reﬂection”. Mooney’s discussion
of music-making frameworks [20] casts them in a diﬀerent
light as “mediators”:
The all-important point is that no framework is a
transparent, neutral, mediator of artistic expres-
sion. All frameworks - because of their design -
have a spectrum of aﬀordance whereby certain
objectives are easier to achieve than others.
393
Music-makers can apply frameworks “naively or know-
ingly, with or without skill”, but regardless, “every frame-
work will make its inﬂuence known, to some extent, in
the creative output. One can ‘hear’ the aﬀordances of the
frameworks used to compose and perform the music” [20].
If DMIs are artistic works, is it possible to see, hear or feel
the presence of NIME frameworks in DMIs? Here we sug-
gest some lenses for viewing common categories of interest
in existing NIME frameworks, from the perspectives of their
applications, elements, scales and combinations (annotated
with indicative references).
By the “application” of a framework, we mean whether
it describes an aspect of the activity undertaken by the re-
searcher or practitioner, or whether it describes the result-
ing artifact or artistic product:
Activity: Design, analysis and evaluation (i.e. a process
by which to create or evaluate an instrument). [21, 23]
Artifact: Instruments, performances and installations (i.e.
properties of the object itself). [21, 27]
The elements of frameworks come in a variety of thinking
styles. Common elements of frameworks can be categorised
by whether they describe, guide, prescribe or analyse:
Describe: Epistemologies, taxonomies. [6, 16]
Guide: Principles, guidelines, heuristics. [5, 11]
Prescribe: Processes, methods, protocols. [21, 14, 8]
Analyse: Criteria, evaluation. [24, 23, 1]
Although frameworks are inherently subjective [2], we can
still use our lenses to describe a common concern about
NIME frameworks. That is, there are a great deal of frame-
works to describe, guide towards and analyse instruments
and far fewer that prescribe methods to design them [14].
Frameworks can also target diﬀerent levels of abstraction,
from high-level interactive considerations to subtle nuances:
Macro: Interactive or performative paradigms (e.g. sym-
bolic vs. embodied interation) [6, 16]
Meso: Instrument families or musical cultures and their
structures (e.g. comparing sensor or mapping strategies)
[19, 17]
Micro: Subtle diﬀerences between otherwise identical in-
struments or performances. [12]
In the last case, though Jord` a proposesmicro-diversity to
describe the ability of a single instrument to support subtly
diﬀerent performances [12], less has been written comparing
the micro-scale diﬀerences between two otherwise identical
instruments.
In conclusion, using the lenses we have introduced, we can
say that NIME frameworks enable the combination and re-
combination of diﬀerent thinking styles, at diﬀerent scales,
for diﬀerent applications. However, it is important to con-
sider what existing NIME frameworks might be missing,
and what the consequences might be.
2.2 Tacit knowledge, craft practice and
evaluation
Designer Bret Victor writes: “One’s ability to articulate an
idea always lags behind the understanding of the idea, and
the understanding of an idea often lags behind the embod-
iment in which it is ﬁrst given life.” [28]
To discuss tacit knowledge - which encompasses what we
“know but can not tell” [25, 4] - and craft practice, we
can borrow from Kettley’s suggested protocol for introduc-
ing craft to other disciplines [15] the three of their seven
principles which are most related to tacit knowledge:
1. Internalization of material:Internalization of both
source material and the material being worked is es-
sential for the development of original language [14].
2. Processes of internalization:Internalization of ma-
terials is achieved through action - techniques include
drawing, direct manipulation of material and repeated
exposure to the material [16].
3. Embodied process: Control over formal expressive
elements at diverse eﬀective ranges is dependent on
an embodied understanding of the processes of pro-
duction [22].
Combining these additional lenses with our existing ones
might explain why there are no thinking styles for micro
scale diﬀerences between instruments. Since craft practice
is at least partially tacit, it is not possible to fully describe
or analyse the internalised processes of design. For DMI
designers, what can be articulated in research literature are
macro scale DMI design principles such as Cook’s [5] and
performer-centred processes such as Morreale’s [21]. For
DMI performers, their ability to give feedback via evalua-
tion methods such as [8] is potentially limited, since players
are not necessarily sensitive to “hypothetical future capa-
bilities” [18]. As Magnusson points out, neither virtuoso
designers, players or anyone else should be expected to be
able to describe material epistemologies in words, since they
so often precede scientiﬁc discovery [16].
However, if as Green suggests we expand the “evalua-
tive horizon” of NIME research to include practice-led ap-
proaches [10], such as those described by Kettley, then we
can start to recognise and study the ways in which detailed
design methods are naturally transferred, such as from prac-
titioner to practitioner [14]. It is obvious that experienced
designers do use feedback and do not fall into the traps de-
scribed, so there must be something else happening in the
design process that is not accounted for by current frame-
works, goals or speciﬁcations. How does Cook know his
design principles to be true, and why do we not doubt him?
2.3 NIMEcraft: plenty of room at the bottom
Feynman’s famous talk, There’s plenty of room at the bot-
tom [9], kickstarted a revolution in nanoscale physics and
engineering. Inspired by this turn of attention to the small,
we introduce the term NIMEcraft to mean the following:
The micro scale diﬀerences between otherwise identical
instruments and their underlying design processes.
Returning to the example of the two violins; they are
both violins, possessing the same “mapping”, embodying
the same musical language, the same people can perform
the same music on them, and yet one is good and one is bad.
NIMEcraft is the diﬀerence between two or morereacTables
[13], two pairs of The Hands [29] or two Birls [26].
We deliberately position NIMEcraft as a subset of craft
that focuses on these details, because we believe this is
where important knowledge about DMI design is hiding in
plain sight, assumed but unspoken. Additionally, we ar-
gue that the details encompassed by NIMEcraft accumu-
late to the extent that NIMEcraft deﬁnes player experience
as much as, if not more than macro and meso scale spec-
iﬁcations do. As NIME advances, focus and attention is
required for the experiential details that distinguish ﬁne in-
struments from crude ones, and correspondingly the ways
that this knowledge can be shared in the community.
3. STUDY METHODOLOGY
There are models and precedents of practice-led craft cul-
ture that NIME can turn to explore ideas of craft. In these
studies we turned to traditional lutherie. Although lutherie
is not equivalent to digital lutherie [12], the relevant paral-
lels are the existence of scientiﬁc knowledge in the commu-
nity, and the practical application of guidelines and frame-
works through tacit knowledge. Therefore, we want to un-
derstand how luthiers create and evaluate new instruments,
how they use scientiﬁc tools, and how players understand
394
the diﬀerence between two instruments that are similar in
all but crafting details.
3.1 Participants
In the ﬁrst of two studies, luthiers were interviewed by a
DMI design researcher about a range of topics in violin
making, which included their use of guidelines, comparison,
measurement and analysis at various stages of the instru-
ment creation process. In the second study, players were
interviewed by a DMI researcher after playing two diﬀerent
violins, where one was known to be of lesser quality. The
luthier study involved six luthiers who exhibited a range
of experience. Half were either undergoing or had recently
completed vocational training in lutherie (L1, L5, L6 ), and
the other half had >25 years of experience as professional
luthiers ( L2, L3, L4 ). The player study involved seven
professional violinists. In this instance, professional was
taken to mean someone who had developed their playing
over greater than ten years, and had signiﬁcant experience
participating in orchestras and ensembles.
3.2 Interview and analysis method
In the luthier study, the luthiers were interviewed in their
workshop (2/6), at the author’s laboratory (1/6) and re-
motely (3/6). In each case they were asked to bring or
have available an instrument in progress, or an instrument
they had made already. The interviews were based on but
not constrained to a script, and covered their development
as luthiers, an instrument they were working on, and their
methods in the context of realising the ﬁne details of violins.
The violin players were invited to the author’s labora-
tory for interview, and brought with them their personal
violin and bow. A week prior to visiting, they were given
a short piece of music to learn. Before the interview, they
were ﬁlmed playing three pieces on their personal violin and
a provided factory-made violin. The ﬁrst piece was from
their repertoire, the second was the piece they had learned
recently, and a new piece of music was also presented to
them on the day. After playing, they were asked about their
musical background, their relationship with their personal
violin and bow, and to compare their playing experiences.
Both studies were thematically analysed deductively [3].
The luthier interviews were coded for references to the qual-
ity of violin function, behaviour and structure, descriptive
clarity and valence (positive or negative), formalised knowl-
edge (theoretical knowledge, explicit knowledge and analyt-
ical thinking) and practice-based knowledge (craft, implicit
knowledge and design thinking). The player interviews were
coded for which violin was being referred to, along with the
same quality and description codes as the luthier study.
4. RESULTS
4.1 Frameworks and goals as foundations
An example of a lutherie framework is the architecture and
geometry of violin body templating, which along with other
foundations distill centuries of accumulated experience and
set the overall constraints of making. The luthiers describe
these guides and prescriptions as oﬀering safety from failure:
L4: “This craft, in planning, in design, in making, it’s all
very safe. You cannot fail if you have a good guide. That’s
why the apprenticeship works so well, because you cannot
fail if you do what you are told.”
L1: “You’re working in the knowledge that whatever you
do, within boundaries, it’s going to sound good.”
Devising frameworks this speciﬁc is a diﬃcult task that
requires years of experience, especially in the numerical or
parametric domain, due to the complexity of the violin:
L1: “Let’s say I made these two violins and the elevation
of this [pointing to violin 1] came up to 27mm on this and
25mm on this [violin 2]. Let’s say this one sounded way bet-
ter, or I preferred the sound of this one, then you could think
‘Ok well, 25mm is obviously the thing to do. I’m going to
make all instruments 25mm from now on.’ But then you’ll
make another one identical, or what you think is identical,
and have it 25mm and it wont sound as good.”
While frameworks insure luthiers against failure, goals
are also necessary to drive them towards ﬁne quality. The
luthiers appear to deliberately set non-speciﬁc goals, due to
the diﬃculty of setting out to fulﬁll criteria:
L3: “The goal is always the same, it’s always a great
instrument. Of course we could say we want something a
bit brighter, a bit darker, a bit deeper, a bit rounder, but
that is secondary.”
L1: “It’s quite hard to start making an instrument with
that goal, to say ‘I’m going to make an instrument that’s
really easy to play’.”
Once the foundation and goal are in place and an ap-
propriate plan has been made, the formal decision making
process comes to an end and the making begins.
4.2 Tacit knowledge enables detailed craft
Before luthiers can make ﬁne instruments, they must spend
substantial time acquiring the necessary tacit knowledge
and crafting expertise:
L4: “Forget about knowing how to make a violin when
you get out of school. You have to spend ten years before
you can make a violin without asking for help.”
L3: “For ﬁve years at school, you learn to control your
hands and you learn to see. You’re given some tools and
materials and you have to learn to see what’s a bump, what’s
a curve, what’s a bump within a curve. If I tell you remove
this 1/10mm here that’s what you need to do... Once you’ve
done that, your eye starts to perceive things, and that’s very
diﬃcult to deﬁne.”
There were similarities in the luthiers’ descriptions of this
process to practising a musical instrument, where repetition
and ﬂow are important factors for internalising the making
process. As the luthier currently studying described:
L1: “For me it’s like practising music. There’s a lot of it
that’s quite like scales where you just have to put the work
in. It’s a weird sensation where you’re switching oﬀ while
being so concentrated and focused. Your brain starts to wan-
der elsewhere but you’re still focusing. It’s similar to prac-
tising the same passage again and again.”
Frameworks are important for luthiers in training during
this acquisition stage, since they are yet to gather the em-
pirical experience necessary to feel their way through the
process:
L1: “I have no idea if [a given violin will] sound better.
I’m judging it purely on the fact that I was given a set of
measurements to follow.”
Whereas the practical aspect of craft is transferable through
tools and frameworks, the tacit knowledge required to ap-
ply them appropriately is not. This impacts their ability to
progress throughout their careers:
L3: “I was in a school recently and looking at the students’
work and trying to comment and help them to see, and they
just can’t see and they wont be able to unless they learn.
There’s no way to transmit this knowledge, to convey, to
give, to communicate this knowledge. Even at my level when
I’ve got a colleague that sees something on my work and tells
me to look at something, if I can’t see it they can’t help me.
They will never see anything until their brain is ready to get
this knowledge.”
When asked to describe what it feels like to be in the
395
moment of making, one luthier noted the limited capacity
of deliberate, logical thinking versus embodied thinking:
L3: “Your hands are guided by your brain, but your brain
is not clever enough to guide you through all those parame-
ters, so it has to be subconscious. Your attention is fully in
this automatic system, which is kind of the opposite of atten-
tion. To concentrate on something semi-automatic doesn’t
make sense. Somehow you need to get into the right frame
of mind that allows your body to act.”
The same luthier was then asked whether they use any
formal analysis techniques during the making process, an-
swering that this approach cannot adequately guide their
decision making process:
L3: “I can’t stand in front of thousands of doors knowing
that if I open a door it might be the wrong one. That might
stop me from going ahead. So I have to assume that I know
something, or decide that I know something, decide that I
might be wrong but I’m going in this direction. I’m relying
on my feeling, what I feel when I make.”
4.3 Tacit knowledge needs open comparative
tools
When asked about the inﬂuence of scientiﬁc forms of knowl-
edge on their work, the luthiers described attempts to inter-
nalise them with varying results. The experienced luthiers
had a desire to learn more, but described a lack of speciﬁc
language that could be related to their making experiences:
L3: “I am still looking for a few keys that will help me
understand how the box is vibrating.”
L2: “For people in my situation who had been studying
making from a traditional point of view, there was no di-
alogue that people could use to explain certain phenomena
about the behaviour of vibrating instruments.”
For example, all of the experienced luthiers mentioned
that visualisation had an impact on their understanding of
their work, but that it was diﬃcult to turn this knowledge
into practical applications:
L3: “That’s been very useful for me as a maker, to under-
stand that every bit of the instrument is moving diﬀerently
according to the frequency that is being played, and to under-
stand the connection between the front and the ribs and the
back. Being able to visualise it, having a slow movement,
that was very useful for me.”
L4: “I like those graphs, they’re full of colours! I just
love it. It just doesn’t basically say where to cut! They don’t
supply any instructions. That’s my problem. I know many
people in this branch of violin making; I ask them direct
questions and they never answer, because they don’t know.
They speculate ‘Why does this violin sound bad and this
one good?’ and they compare those two graphs and they are
almost identical. But how to move this [acoustic] peak here,
and this peak here [indicating two points on a violin plate]?
I guarantee you they have no idea, because they’re doing it
the wrong way - measuring with computers. The computer
is as clever as the guy who programmed it, unfortunately.
We rely on our hands.”
The theme of frameworks as reassuring inﬂuences reemerged,
but again in this context with limited actionable conse-
quences:
L3: “I have colleagues that are quite into scientiﬁc ap-
proaches, which I think is a good way to reassure them. I’m
afraid I haven’t seen anything convincing in the serious re-
search that’s been going for 20 years apart from the visual-
ising tool. The rest hasn’t been very useful.”
One luthier had sustained an interest in using acoustic
theory in their making. They reﬂected that familiarisation
with it had integrated with their tacit knowledge, suggesting
there are traceable links between them:
L2: “Some of us are struggling with just understanding
the theory behind it, but actually coming to a point now
where, for an instrument maker, it might not be necessary
to understand totally the theory.
It kind of remains tacit empirical ways of working. What
seems to happen is that when your understanding of the
physical behaviour of the thing increases, it doesn’t neces-
sarily mean for example that I am capable of describing very
very accurately what is going on. But it’s changing my total
view of the way an instrument behaves, sort of through the
back door, in a way.”
However, they found this relationship diﬃcult to describe
when asked to elaborate, despite their conﬁdence of its im-
pact on their work:
L2: “What I’m trying to say is that the knowledge gained
through this kind of acoustic work, is not necessarily some-
thing I would be able to write very eloquently about. But
it inﬂuences me a lot, and I know for a fact that is has
improved the sound of my instruments.”
4.4 Playing and testing as separate skills
The luthiers were adamant that players were sensitive to
violin quality in a completely diﬀerent way to them, which
made players mostly unsuited to the task of evaluating a
violin. Despite undergoing far less training in instrumental
practice than players, luthiers are able to test their instru-
ments with simple but precise gestures:
L3: “Playing the cello for me means pulling the bow. I
can still test, I have learned to hear. I have learned to deﬁne
what works and what doesn’t work, even with a shitty bow
technique. If it works with my bow technique, it will work
for the potential customers.”
At the core of this issue seemed to be a distinction be-
tween playing and testing instruments:
L4: “Musicians can diﬀerentiate. They cannot tell a good
instrument if they don’t have a good and a bad instrument.
Give musicians three instruments, and after twenty minutes
they would have no idea which one they played. It’s so con-
fusing, it’s so demanding, you have to be trained. You have
to have big stamina to do this.”
Stamina in the previous quote was referring to the luthiers’
ability to test for long periods, and in doing so retaining the
feeling of a comparison long after the sensory impression had
faded. This was cited as a critical testing skill that was as
hard won as any other in their work. There appeared to be
a link between their desire to test in detail and their overall
goal of ﬁne quality:
L3: “I think you really have to go beyond the obvious
‘yeah it’s working, it’s ﬁne, it’s a great cello’. It’s never
just great; you have to understand what is good and what
could be better.”
Luthiers tested their instruments against idealised be-
haviour, which was claimed to be more particular than what
a violinist would look for:
L3: “Some musicians are actually quite good at testing
instruments, but they are quite rare because most of them
haven’t tried enough to know what we need to look for. They
need to aim for this absolute, perfect sound.”
Feedback from diﬀerent players can be ambiguous and
ﬂuctuates based on their level of experience:
L1: “‘Projection’ and ‘ease to play’ are meaningless words.
I could ﬁnd something easy to play that you would ﬁnd hor-
rible... The threshold [of quality] changes for everyone as
well, based on your playing ability.”
As a result, one of the more experienced luthiers claimed
to have gradually become less dependent on musician’s feed-
back:
L3: “I don’t rely on the musicians’ opinion anymore to
396
adjust my instrument, because most of them are not used to
trying instruments. They are used to their own instruments
and making them work for their needs. They are not used
to playing for an ideal mechanism, an ampliﬁer. They don’t
know what works with their instrument, they know they love
it and they will never use anything else. The point is, when I
demonstrate my instrument they have have to be impressed,
shocked by the amplifying capacity, the link between string
vibration and bow action.”
4.5 Verbal player feedback misses details
To investigate the limitations of player feedback as described
by the luthiers, seven violinists were asked to compare their
experience of playing a factory-made violin and bow with
their own in quick succession. As expected, all partici-
pants preferred their personal violin, citing lower quality
aspects of function, behaviour and structure in the factory-
made violin. 6/7 players mentioned the factory-made vio-
lin’s strings as being poorly spaced due to the proportions
of the bridge and neck, and connected this to diﬃculty and
discomfort of playing experience:
P3: “What was a bit challenging, or annoying, is that the
bridge is less round (ﬂat). So I kept hitting D string while I
was playing other strings. I tried to adjust to that, but still.
My own violin has more curvature on the string.”
P5: “The string are not as close to each other. It’s quite
diﬃcult to keep doing what you are used to with your own
instrument, but you adapt. It requires more attention and
you are more likely to make silly mistakes.”
P7: “I am quite familiar with that, I’ve played it a lot.
They are a nice instrument. If you put a new bridge on that
it could sound pretty decent... The bridges they come with
are a bit fat and chunky.”
It seems plausible that the above comments could be
turned into design changes with minimal interpretation. How-
ever when the quality of the sound and playing experience
are mentioned, the essential qualities seemed harder to de-
scribe and diﬃcult to relate to physical properties or be-
haviours of the violin:
P3: “Well it’s small sound. And it has the sour sound of
new string. The sound I usually have on new strings on my
violin. But I don’t think these are new strings. So I think
it just stays.”
P5: “It’s basic. It plays but you can’t work around too
much. Not color, not feeling. You want an A, you get an
A, but that’s it.”
There appears to be diﬃculty in identifying appropriate
words to describe these diﬀerences; P7 invented a term,
“bowy”, to describe their experience. Generally the inter-
views demonstrated a verbal pattern of comparisons made
in a goldilocks form of “W is X Y than Z”, where W and
Z were the two violins, X a determiner such as more, less,
a bit , and Y a violin feature. Another method of describ-
ing the factory-made violin was to use the idea of “a good
violin” (P1) as a counterexample, which has some similar-
ities with the way luthiers’ tacitly test against “absolute,
perfect sound”. Overall, this suggests a useful but limited
contribution of verbal feedback from players.
5. DISCUSSION
Violin makers do not rely on explicit means of creating or
evaluating their work, such as evaluation criteria and player
reports. Instead they rely implicitly on their tacit, embod-
ied abilities and experiences. Though these ways of knowing
are often personal, subjective and unveriﬁable, they enable
the realisation of ﬁne instruments. Similarly in DMI design
there are no explicitly “inviolable laws” [12], and as Jorda
states:
Digital lutherie should not be considered as a sci-
ence nor an engineering technology, but as a sort
of craftsmanship that sometimes may produce a
work of art.
NIME frameworks, which are positioned as fundamental
to DMI creation, commonly oﬀer DMI designers analytical
and descriptive ways of working only. They do not sup-
port the craft aspects of DMI design, nor do they describe
ﬁne details or how to realise them. We have introduced
the term NIMEcraft - meaning the micro scale diﬀerences
between otherwise identical instruments and their under-
lying design processes - to highlight this shortcoming, and
to discuss how DMI designers as craftspeople can be better
supported. We explore the implications of NIMEcraft for
NIME frameworks, dissemination, crafting tools and evalu-
ation.
5.1 Implications for NIME frameworks
Our results indicate that the tacit and embodied knowl-
edge of instrument makers is paramount to the realisation
of a ﬁne instrument. The primary implication for NIME
frameworks therefore is that they should account for and
support the development of these forms of knowledge as
described by Kettley [15]. Furthermore, at varied experi-
ence levels the violin makers applied frameworks in diﬀerent
ways, demonstrating an opportunity for NIME frameworks
to target speciﬁc experience levels. In terms of utilising
player feedback in design processes, our results show that
NIME frameworks must account for the diﬀerences in tacit
knowledge between designers and players. Particularly, a
heightened design intuition in designers compared to play-
ers is frequently overlooked by NIME frameworks.
5.2 Implications for NIME dissemination
No infrastructure exists today that is exclusively focused on
NIMEcraft dissemination; ﬁne details of instrument craft
are often subjective and thus are unsuitable for inclusion
in scientiﬁc papers, and performances exhibit only the ﬁ-
nal form of the instrument without reference to its design
process. By comparison, violin making is centred around an
apprenticeship model with a rigorous focus on acquisition of
embodied design expertise, similar in intensity to studying
in a music conservatoire. Jorda’s teaching framework [14]
appears to be a step towards a self-sustaining culture of
NIME practitioners, but there is clearly more to be learned
from long-lasting instrument making cultures in this regard.
Additionally, the violin makers emphasised the importance
of continually exchanging craft practice in person and on-
line. Given that the NIME community is experienced with
facilitating events and online communication, it could strive
to develop means to support these vital activities.
5.3 Implications for NIME crafting tools
Through inquiring as to the inﬂuence of scientiﬁc tools on
violin making, our results suggest that some tools are bet-
ter than others at supporting instrument craft processes.
Particularly, tools that were created to support scientiﬁc
or engineering knowledge had a meager impact compared
to tools that would facilitate open interpretation via em-
bodied experience such as slow motion vibration visualisa-
tion. Though many DMIs support embodied interaction by
the player, the design tools for creating them take a scien-
tiﬁc or engineering mindset that diminishes the role of the
designer’s embodied knowledge. Our results suggest that
such engineering tools may be less than ideal for encourag-
ing the development of NIMEcraft skills. Thus, we suggest
the community should consider creating DMI design tools
397
with the same attitude with which it creates instruments
for musicians.
5.4 Implications for NIME evaluation
For professional violin makers, there appeared to be an indi-
rect relationship between a player’s indication of preference
and violin structure and behaviour, leading the makers to
develop and rely on their own internalised sense of quality.
NIME evaluation instead frequently relies on an audience
response to a performance, or a player’s judgment. Supple-
menting audience and player interpretations with the evalu-
ation of NIMEcraft by the DMI designer and other design-
ers has the potential to create a more complete, nuanced
and constructive instrument evaluation. This would have
the added beneﬁt of encouraging DMI designers to deepen
their expertise in the evaluation of ﬁne instrument craft.
6. CONCLUSION
We have identiﬁed a subset of craft, termed NIMEcraft, to
highlight the need for more investigation into micro scale
diﬀerences across identical instruments and their underly-
ing design processes. We have established traditional vi-
olin lutherie as a model of instrumental craft culture that
NIME can learn from to improve its frameworks, dissemina-
tion, tools and evaluation. In doing so we have explored the
importance of an instrument designer’s tacit and embodied
knowledge. By highlighting NIMEcraft as an important fac-
tor in DMI design beyond familiar science and engineering
processes, we encourage further discussion about how such
skills and methods can be learned and shared.
