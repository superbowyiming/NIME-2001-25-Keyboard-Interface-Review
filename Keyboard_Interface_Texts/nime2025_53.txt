Abstract
Numerous experiments in bowed string augmentation have been
undertaken, with each reflecting the values and interests of the
builder. The EV takes a unique approach, with the convolution
of a synthesized and acoustic string signal at the foundation of
its design. Through an iterative hardware and software develop-
ment process, three versions of the instrument have been created,
each building toward the goal of a robust compositional and
performative platform for exploring the shared boundary of elec-
tronic and acoustic sound. Spatialization and physical modeling
algorithms have furthered the instrument’s engagement with
the interaction between physical and virtual acoustics. This pa-
per examines the iterative design process behind the instrument
and its relationship between digital augmentation and acoustic
resonance.

1 Background
Over the past 50 years, the bowed string interface has remained a
rich site of exploration for instrument builders. Seeking to expand
its expressive potential within the context of electro-acoustic mu-
sic, each experiment has grappled with the challenge of adapting
these instruments to electronic and digital frameworks. Their
pitch is not identified as easily as that of a keyboard and the
amplitude of the four strings is harder to track than that of mono-
phonic instruments. Despite resistance to straightforward digital
integration, the violin family’s central role within Western clas-
sical music and its expressive potential have sustained ongoing
experimentation. Rather than discouraging innovation, these
complexities have sparked waves of creative responses, each
navigating the tensions between acoustic traditions and digital
augmentation in diverse ways.
Some approaches aimed to enhance or augment the instru-
ment’s natural resonances. Max Mathews’s Electronic Violin
incorporated electronic resonators to emulate the reverberance
of an acoustic violin’s body [16]. While this method sought to
preserve the instrument’s traditional sound within an electronic
medium, other approaches have explored ways of extending

its sonic potential beyond acoustic precedent. Actuated instru-
ments, such as the Halldorophone [30], use transducers both on
the strings and within the acoustic body to extend resonance
through the creation and control of feedback loops.
Other experiments use the violin as a controller, extracting
only pitch and amplitude information. The VSC-1, a prototype of
the Zeta, used conductive sensors to track finger position with
the goal of controlling synthesizers [19] [17]. Eventually, the Zeta
abandoned this approach in favor of pitch tracking the acoustic
string [29]. Other experiments explored hardware-assisted pitch
tracking, in which the physical location of the depressed string
was reported to the software, improving detection accuracy [22].
Rather than using pitch information to control a synthesizer, the
Svampolin built upon this prior work to correct pitch and timbral
inconsistencies, outputting the result through an actuator on the
instrument’s body [21].
Abandoning the traditional violin form entirely, the BoSSA
(Bowed-Sensor-Speaker-Array) is a “deconstructed violin” that
separates the instrument into its primary physical interfaces [27].
Forgoing acoustic strings, its fingerboard houses a single linear
position sensor which tracks finger position; the bow rubs against
four force-sensing sponges, driving synthesis algorithms. Depart-
ing the physical realm, Coretet is a virtualized string quartet that
uses Oculus Touch controllers [6] as an interface. Players interact
in a shared virtual space via headsets, while hearing each other’s
instruments (which are synthesized with physical models).
Some instruments extend the conventional functionality of
the violin with arrays of onboard sensors. Built on an electric
upright bass, the SBass is extended with additional pickups, but-
tons, and even a mouse trackpad, which control processing on
a laptop [ 1]. The Overtone Violin was designed to push “the
cutting edge of musical performance... and [maximize] human
physical/cognitive skills in the control of digital multimedia sys-
tems” [20]. Equipped with a range of sensors, it aimed to “put
real-time signal processing under direct expressive control of the
performer, thereby pushing the envelope of violin performance
and composition into completely new areas” [20].
Two questions have persisted within augmented string experi-
ments: Is the physical string retained (or replaced with a sensor)?
And if retained, what role does it play in sound generation? In the
Electronic Violin, the string functioned as an acoustic element,
with Mathews’s innovation lying in the recreation of the violin
body using electronic resonators. The Zeta, by contrast, used the
string as a source of pitch and amplitude data. In many actuated
instruments, the string serves both as a melodic component and
as the exciter or agent within a feedback loop.
Embracing the traditional bowed string mechanism, the EV
(short for electronic viola or violin) explores the boundary be-
tween the acoustic and electronic through cross-synthesis. Its

pickups capture the acoustic sound for two uses: to extract pitch
and amplitude data, driving a synthesizer, and to convolve the
acoustic signal with the synthesized output. The result is a sound
that embodies the physicality of the string while extending it
into the imaginative space of computer-generated audio. In the
EV, the string’s vibration becomes the nexus of the player’s inten-
tion—just as the voice of a singer conveys their emotive expres-
sion. Jean-Claude Risset described synthesized sound as evocative
of a virtual world: immaterial yet perceptually real, capable of
suggesting alternate realities rooted in perception rather than
physical environment [24]. Seeking to unite the nuanced expres-
sivity of the acoustic string with the expansive sonic palette
Risset describes, the EV uses FFT convolution algorithms to fuse
these two realms.
Eschewing additional control modalities, the instrument’s on-
tology centers on shaping electronic sound using the traditional
techniques of a trained acoustic string player. As the instru-
ment has evolved, this foundational premise—the juxtaposition
of acoustic and electronic sound—has expanded to include im-
mersive virtual spaces and physical modeling.
2 Objectives
The EV’s design has been shaped by two interrelated objectives:
capturing the idiomatic nuances of string playing for the cre-
ation of electronic music, and retaining the expressive power of
embodied string performance.
2.1 An Interface that Captures the Nuance of
String Playing
Sensors used to translate physical movement into control data
are often reductive and limited in dimensionality. While their
ease of implementation is a clear advantage, they can fall short,
especially when compared to the storied precedents in instru-
ment design over past centuries and across diverse cultures. Even
with the advent of advanced sensors, interfaces tend to gravitate
toward simpler arrangements of buttons and knobs. For example,
the absence of string-like controllers pales in comparison to the
ubiquity of keyboard-based interfaces. While there are multiple
explanations for this, Ryan Didick points to a “claviocentricism”
in Western music, where the centrality of the keyboard has fos-
tered an embedded “historical standardization” and “cultural
logic” [4]. Numerous instances are evident throughout digital
music frameworks, from MIDI to DAW design. The keyboard was
termed “dictatorial” by Buchla, and distracted from the “knobs
and the wires and the interconnections and the timbres” [ 26].
Wessel and Wright questioned the electronic music industry’s
“insistence on standard keyboard controllers” [28], and technolo-
gist Jaron Lanier laments that MIDI can only represent “the tile
mosaic world of the keyboardist, not the watercolor world of
the violin” [8]. While this standardization has been beneficial
in many ways, its limitations become especially apparent when
attempting to interface with computer music systems at the level
of dimensionality that non-keyboard instrumentalists are accus-
tomed to. In contrast, the EV aims to capture the full spectrum
of sonic nuance articulated by the performer.
The bow shapes sound based on various factors: placement
relative to the bridge, drawing speed (which can also affect pitch),
and arm pressure. Additional considerations include the bow’s
angle and its tilt relative to the string.
The left hand also plays a significant role. Beyond determining
pitch, the pressure (or lack thereof) applied to the string and
the part of the finger used (the tip versus the fleshy pad) affect
both timbre and the string’s ability to vibrate. The coordinated
actions of the bow and left hand can produce less obvious effects
as well. For example, simultaneously releasing both bow and
finger pressure causes a more pronounced decay, as the reduced
finger pressure dampens the ringing of the strings.
Through the use of a phase vocoder, these sonic nuances be-
come embedded as information within spectral analysis. While
there are many potential applications of this data, the EV focuses
on the convolution of the instrument’s acoustic signal with that
of a synthesizer, tracking pitch and amplitude. The electronic
music palette is vast, and its possibilities are compelling for mu-
sic creation. Similarly, the expressive potential of bowed string
instruments is also vast, and equally compelling in performance.
The EV strives to integrate the strengths of these two practices
into a complementary whole.
2.2 The Power of Embodied String
Performance
While the computer can generate limitless sonic possibilities, this
very strength can also present a challenge in performance. Before
the advent of electronic and digital platforms, sound creation
relied on kinetic input, with the sonic result typically correspond-
ing to its intensity. Wessel noted that “we hear in accord with
hypotheses that we have about the world” [2]. This suggests that
our musical experience is intertwined with our experience of
the world. Marc Leman explores this connection, asserting that
both listening to and creating music are “constrained by body
movements, which play a central role in all musical activities.
The embodied music cognition approach posits that the (musical)
mind results from this embodied interaction with music” [10].
While many forms of electronic music performance have phys-
ical aspects (even pushing ‘play’ for a tape piece), the EV’s objec-
tive is to not only preserve the embodied creation of sound but
also to retain the kinetic dynamic of the bow’s force against a
physical string. In live string performance, this relationship—fully
expressed—can create a powerful experience. The somatic con-
nection between listener and performer, as described by Leman, is
further appreciated through the dynamic between the performer
and the instrument’s acoustic result. Preserving this interaction
as the foundation for electronic sound generation is a central aim
of the EV.
3 The EV’s Genesis and Overarching Design
Concerns
The EV has undergone three iterations: EV 1, EV 2, and EV 2.5.
Design efforts have centered on sensors (for pitch and amplitude
tracking), the instrument’s body, and software. Throughout these
iterations, musical output has remained a central focus.
Software design has primarily been within Pure Data (PD),
accompanied by additional C++ code. Body specifications have
prioritized securely housing the sensors, structural integrity, and
ease of play, while retaining the standard dimensions of a 16-inch
viola.
4 EV 1
EV 1 served as the initial foray into the project, a step into the
unknown before a larger trajectory had been fully considered.
A retrofitted acoustic viola, shown in figure 1, was chosen as an
accessible point of entry.

4.1 Sensors
As earlier pitch-tracking experiments using fiddle~ proved un-
desirable due to latency and accuracy issues, the decision was
made to embed conductive sensors under each string to track
finger position (similar to [9]). A current would travel through
the strings and, when depressed, would pass to the conductive
fingerboard. Functioning as a voltage divider, the voltage output
from the sensor could be mapped to a corresponding frequency.
Drawing on the use of graphite as a resistive material in poten-
tiometers, a mixture of methylene chloride, graphite powder, and
thermoplastic beads was created to form the sensor. A groove
was cut in the fingerboard under each string, and the material
was packed into the cavity in layers. Once dried, it was filed
down to be flush with the surface of the wood. Contacts were
installed at both ends of each resistive strip, with a conduit cut
into the neck to house five wires: one for each string and an-
other for ground. Power was supplied at the other end of the
fingerboard. To improve contact between the strings and the fin-
gerboard, the A and D strings were replaced with a second set of
G and C strings, pitched up a step. In software, these strings were
re-pitched to their original octave, but when processed through
the FFT convolution, they resulted in a darker timbre.
To enable independent amplitude tracking for each string,
a quadrophonic pickup was designed. Four bobbins were con-
structed, each with a cylindrical nickel-alloy magnet core. The
resistance of the wire winding was tested during the winding pro-
cess to ensure consistency across pickups. Once assembled, the
four pickups were encased in thermoplastic to improve durability
and structural integrity.
Truncated RJ45 (Ethernet) cables were used to connect both
the pickup output and the conductive strips to Ethernet couplers
fastened to the lower bout of the viola. Longer cables connected to
the other side of the couplers were used to carry both signal sets
from the instrument to two processing boxes. One box housed
a quad preamp and envelope follower circuit of Nic Collins’s
design [3], and the second box contained pull-down resistors for
the pitch strips and an Arduino Mega for analog-to-digital (ADC)
conversion. The preamp unit also included four audio outputs,
which bypassed the envelope follower.
4.2 Software
An Arduino program 1 was developed to transmit the 10-bit
value for each sensor to PD via the comport external, yielding a
1 kHz sample rate per sensor. Each sensor sample was split into
a 7-bit data byte and a status byte that encoded the upper bits
along with a sensor-specific offset, enabling synchronization and
recovery in the event of dropped bytes during serial transmission.
The fingerboard sensor data was then mapped to corresponding
frequencies using a linear interpolation algorithm. The software
gradually took shape, informed by the composition process. The
signal flow structure adhered to a conventional audio production
paradigm: control input, audio generation (synthesis), and mixing
(including effect sends).
EV 1 incorporated an FM synthesizer, four FFT algorithms—two
from [25], one from [7], and one designed by the author—as well
as the rev1~ reverb object. Additionally, a mixing console was
implemented (enabling signal routing between synthesis mod-
ules) along with a CV matrix (for applying envelope control to
various synthesis parameters).
4.3 Results
4.3.1 Successes. The initial EV 1 iteration proved successful: de-
tailed pitch and amplitude tracking provided a level of control
over the synthesizer that felt intimately connected to the sensa-
tion of string playing. There were concerns that the 10-bit con-
version might not offer sufficient resolution; however, it proved
acceptable. Furthermore, the various convolution algorithms pro-
duced compelling sonic results, adding the desired nuance to the
synthesized sound and occasionally yielding welcome surprises.

The instrument’s latency measured approximately 50 ms, which
remained usable for slow to moderate tempi.
EV 1 was used to create two compositions. The first wasEtudes
& Vignettes [11], a work of six short movements, each composed
of multi-layered tracks. The use of FFT convolution (section 1)
can be heard throughout. In the first movement, the opening D
pizzicato triggers an FM synthesizer, which is convolved with the
string’s acoustic signal. This algorithm (FFT 2), of the author’s
design, asymmetrically combines the two sounds: only Source
B’s magnitude and Source A’s phase are used. This results in the
output’s spectral shape and loudness being shaped by Source
B, while Source A governs its temporal evolution and harmonic
structure, producing a noisy, inharmonic convolution. This can
be heard in the strident quality of the opening line. The other two
layers are processed similarly, however, the FM synthesizer is sent
wet-only to the convolution algorithm, and the pulse-width of
the square wave is modulated by the string’s amplitude, resulting
in an output that is slightly less direct, yet more dynamic than
the first layer. In contrast, the second movement makes use of an
algorithm by [7]. The FFT data from the synthesizer functions as
as a magnitude filter for the string’s phase content, giving the
string a brighter timbre, like an overblown wind instrument, and
also more harmonic than FFT 2.
The second work, Nuages [12], adopted a more acousmatic
approach, treating EV 1 as a sound source from which short
fragments were extracted, transformed, and reassembled into a
fixed-media composition. Due to the nature of the composition
process, processing parameters were not noted.
4.3.2 Shortcomings. Despite its successes, EV 1 had several short-
comings. While the pitch data obtained via the Arduino remained
consistent for an hour or so, it would eventually drift from the
string pitch, requiring remapping. In retrospect, this may have
resulted from fluctuations in the battery-powered envelope fol-
lower, compounded by inconsistencies in the conductive material:
the groove dimensions were irregular and the material contained
air pockets. Additionally, the analog envelope follower had a
limited dynamic range, restricting the instrument’s full expres-
sive potential. Loose electrical connections on the instrument’s
body also became an issue, as the retrofitting lacked proper fas-
tening methods for securing components. A major hindrance
was persistent crosstalk between strings. Suspecting sympathetic
resonances were being amplified by the instrument’s body, in-
sulating foam sealant was applied inside the body, but the issue
remained unresolved. Both the successes and the identified short-
comings led to the development of a second iteration, EV 2.
5 EV 2
EV 2 introduced a custom-built 3D-printed body (figure 2) de-
signed to better accommodate sensors and connections, while
the adoption of printed circuit boards (PCBs) aimed to mitigate
wiring and connection failures.
5.1 Body
A new body was designed using Autodesk Fusion 360, with pri-
mary considerations including structural integrity under string
tension, optimal sensor housing, and the tactile feel of a tra-
ditional instrument. The specifics of 3D printing both forced
accommodation in the design and presented opportunities. Due
to the flexible nature of polylactic acid (PLA) filament, it was
decided that the conduit running through the neck would also
house a carbon fiber rod for structural reinforcement. Addition-
ally, the limited size of the printing bed required the instrument
to be printed in three separate pieces: fingerboard, body, and
chinrest. Dovetail joints were incorporated to securely lock the
3D-printed components together, while the carbon fiber tube
and bolts ensured the joint could withstand string tension. As an
added benefit, 3D printing allowed for the integration of conduits
through the fingerboard and body, providing dedicated pathways
for wiring.
Guitar machine tuners were selected for tuning stability and
ease of installation. Positioning the tuners near the chinrest
shifted the instrument’s balance toward the collarbone, making
it feel lighter in the left hand compared to a traditional viola. The
instrument retained two Ethernet jacks for transmitting pitch
and amplitude information to a processing box.
5.2 Sensors
The presence of inter-string crosstalk was a hindrance in EV 1.
Suspecting that the oscillation of a string might be transduced by
its neighboring pickup, EV 2 employed a custom-built infrared
(IR) pickup. An IR LED was positioned 180 degrees opposite an
IR photodiode, casting the oscillating shadow of the vibrating
string. The same preamplifier design was retained, but the hard-
ware envelope follower was omitted in favor of a software-based
solution. This included a slew limiter (restricting upward and
downward signal motion over 44 samples), a two-pole lowpass
filter at 200 Hz, a highpass filter at 120 Hz, a full-wave rectifier,
and a one-pole lowpass filter with an amplitude-derived variable
cutoff between 20–120 Hz. Finally, thethreshold ~ object was used
as a Schmitt trigger.
In an effort to achieve more consistent resistance across the
length of the conductive strips, EV 2 used conductive PLA instead
of the graphite-thermoplastic mixture. Each strip was printed
and inserted into corresponding grooves along the fingerboard.
5.3 Software
Rather than an Arduino, EV 2 employed a Bela single-board com-
puter for digital signal processing. An enhancement, the Bela’s
ADC supported a higher 16-bit resolution and an analog sam-
pling rate of 22.05 kHz. It also had the capacity to run PD patches
independently, without the need for a computer. However, due to
the limited number of audio input pins the sensors were routed
through the analog inputs, foregoing the benefits of delta-sigma
noise reduction. The patch was transferred to the Bela, with the
exception of the GUI objects, which remained on the laptop and
communicated with the DSP processes on the Bela via Wi-Fi.
The patch also required increased processing efficiency on the
less-capable Bela; many switch~ objects were added to reduce
unnecessary computational load. Additionally, a throttle was
designed to control the GUI update rate; because the Bela’s de-
sign prioritizes audio processing, excess GUI (network) data can
overwhelm the networking functionality.
A second FM synthesizer (based on a different design) and
a phase distortion synthesizer were added, along with transfer
functions for waveshaping at various points in the signal chain.
5.4 Results
While EV 2 demonstrated clear advancement, new issues emerged
and some existing challenges persisted.
5.4.1 Successes. Overall the electrical connections became sig-
nificantly more reliable. Unlike EV 1, which was deemed too

unstable for stage use, EV 2 was successfully employed in sev-
eral performances, a major step forward toward creating a ro-
bust, stage-worthy instrument. While latency was not formally
measured, it was noticeably reduced. The conductive strips also
proved more reliable for pitch tracking, likely due to the consis-
tency in resistance, and possibly a more stable power supply.
5.4.2 Shortcomings. Contact between the string and the surface
of the strip remained an issue. Although the string could be de-
pressed onto the strip, the electrical contact was not as consistent
as it had been with EV 1, perhaps due to the textured 3D-printed
surface. Another concern was flex in the neck; as the strings were
tightened, the action became slightly higher than anticipated in
the design. Furthermore, any change in pressure on the neck
would result in a small shift in pitch.
Crosstalk between strings was a persistent problem. Suspect-
ing that light may be scattering into adjacent photodiodes via
unintended reflections, heat shrink tubing was added to each
transmitter and receiver to act as a blinder. While this did not
resolve the problem, it did make the receiver less susceptible to
ambient light. Later, a hood was designed for the pickup, enabling
outdoor performance in sunlight or under incandescent stage
lights.
After transferring the PD patch to the Bela, the sound of the
processing changed dramatically. It was discovered that some
objects central to the project could not be compiled for use on
the Bela. Although this setup was used to compose Recording 7
Noise [5] and for live improvised performances, processing was
ultimately moved back to the laptop, and the Bela was replaced
with the Arduino.
Having taken the first step in designing a custom body for the
EV, but still encountering unresolved issues with basic function-
ality, plans for EV 2.5 quickly came into focus.
6 EV 2.5
Designed as a revision, EV 2.5 (figure 3) aimed to address the
shortcomings of EV 2.
6.1 Body
Recognizing that the EV 2’s neck lacked sufficient stiffness, EV 2.5
incorporated tough PLA in place of standard PLA. Additionally, a
more robust carbon fiber tube support was implemented: a 6 mm
diameter tube inserted into an 8 mm tube, resulting in a 4 mm
thick wall.
6.2 Sensors
Rather than 3D-printed conductive strips, EV 2.5 used conductive
rubber. Recognizing that the contact between the string and the
conductive surface was critical, it was hypothesized that the
pliability of the rubber could slightly “hug” the string, improving
the connection. Strips of 0.5 mm-thick rubber were cut and placed
into the grooves of the fingerboard’s surface. Electrical contact
at the top and bottom of each strip was established using small
bolts. Corresponding nuts were inserted into slots within the
body’s surface; the bolts passed through small holes in the rubber,
pressing it against the nut.
Still contending with crosstalk issues, the original Nic Collins
preamp design was re-evaluated. It was discovered that the hex
inverter was the source of the problem. While the original de-
sign is monophonic, the quadrophonic version had impedance
mismatches, allowing output from one channel to flow from the
summing stage back into the signal path of another. Switching
to an op-amp ultimately resolved the issue.
Although the pickup noise had dramatically improved since
EV 1, the system’s noise floor still prevented reliable tracking of
quiet playing. Suspecting an issue with the infrared design, the
positions of the transmitter and receiver were changed: rather
than the transmitter shining directly into the receiver, both were
angled at 60 degrees to each other. In this configuration, the
light reaching the receiver was reflected off the string. While
measurements were not taken between the two versions, the
adjusted placement noticeably reduced the noise floor.
Lastly, the Bela was reintroduced as an ADC due to its higher
sample rate and greater bit depth. A C++ program was developed
to transmit sensor data via USB using Open Sound Control (OSC)
to PD, where a system was implemented to parse the data with

minimal latency2. A circular buffer writing to the auxiliary OSC
process ensured uninterrupted data flow between the Bela and
PD, where a corresponding circular buffer (to protect against
transmission jitter) received data.
6.3 Software
As the EV achieved greater reliability, efforts were made to ex-
pand software capabilities. A preset system was implemented to
2https://github.com/brianlindgren/Bela-to-PD-over-OSC
enable changes in system state. While the instrument had always
been polyphonic, most settings were previously global across all
strings; with EV 2.5, each string gained independent parameter
control. New effects included a grain delay and a buffer freeze
(based on a PD PaulStretch implementation [23]), which could
be applied independently to each mix channel. The grain delay
also included a function that allowed the delay line to cease writ-
ing new input and recirculate existing material. As additional
software modules were introduced, the number of parameters

per preset grew accordingly, with each string currently using 396
independent parameters.
The CV matrix was expanded with additional sources, includ-
ing a spectral centroid tracker, LFOs, and a triggerable custom-
drawn envelope, along with corresponding new parameter des-
tinations. A major step forward in spatial control came with
the addition of a panning engine for multichannel playback. Ini-
tially, a system similar to Vector Base Amplitude Panning was
developed, but this was soon replaced by a third-order ambisonic
engine, coined ambiNilla3.
A basic physical model, derived from the Karplus–Strong al-
gorithm, was implemented. All sound modules and signal paths
were also upgraded to support up to eight multichannel voices,
each capable of slight detuning and controlled parameter random-
ization. Individual voices could be spatially distributed across the
soundfield, enabling immersive sonic possibilities.
With the growing processing overhead, the pd ~ multicore
object was introduced, assigning each string to its own core,
while the ambisonic decoder and GUI were allocated separate
cores, utilizing six cores in total.
As with previous EV iterations, the mixer retained the ability
to route any mix channel’s (now multichannel) signal to the input
of another module. The newly added modules further expanded
the routing possibilities. For example, a synthesizer’s output can
be sent to a convolution algorithm, processed with reverb, routed
to another convolution engine, and then passed through the grain
delay before reaching the final output. See figure 4 for a signal
flow diagram and figure 5 for an annotated view of the GUI.
6.3.1 Zero Crossing Pitch Tracking. While experimenting with a
C++ port of the EV software, a simple zero-crossing pitch detec-
tion method was implemented. Its accuracy and responsiveness
were impressive, perhaps due to the clarity of the IR pickups (fig-
ure 6). Even the ‘noise’ at the beginning of a pizzicato or bowed
note, which caused a fast succession of misreadings, convincingly
3https://github.com/brianlindgren/ambiNilla
paralleled the acoustic noise of a transient. The C++ detector was
then ported as a PD external called zDet~4.
Unlike the earlier sensor-based finger-tracking approach, this
method eliminated the need for a time-consuming calibration
process. A significant breakthrough in the EV journey, this re-
solved the earlier pitch tracking issues, rendering the conductive
strips obsolete.
6.4 Results
Perhaps the more significant of the two revisions, EV 2.5 resolved
most of the remaining issues present in EV 2, and realized the
vision first imagined in EV 1.
Crosstalk was eliminated with the op-amp. Body flexion was
improved and no longer affected the action; however, slight flex-
ing remains and will be addressed in future versions. Pitch track-
ing was stabilized using the zero-crossing detection method. The
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improved, though with a dynamic
range of approximately 60 dB, there remains room for refinement.
Lastly, the software capabilities expanded considerably.
The EV was finally able to reliably perform Etudes & Vignettes
live [13], fulfilling the composition’s original vision. Additionally,
a new work, Daughter of the Stars [15] [14], was composed to
take advantage of features introduced in EV 2.5.
String players often consider a room’s reverberation as an
extension of both the instrument’s body and the resonance of the
strings. With its new multichannel capabilities, the EV further
explored the hybridization of real and virtual space. In Daughter
of the Stars , the immersive qualities of ambisonics, combined
with artificial reverberation, allow the performer to ‘play’ the
virtual space in much the same way that an acoustic environ-
ment merges with an instrument’s natural resonance. With the
signal chain now supporting up to eight voices (section 6.3), the
expanded reverberation can more convincingly render an im-
mersive environment, helping to “assimilate the unknown to the
familiar, ” as described by Risset [24].

Additionally, the inclusion of the grain delay and buffer freeze
effect made possible the perpetuation of sound beyond the draw-
ing of the bow, allowing for the decoupling of input and continu-
ous sound, and expanding compositional potential. For example,
throughout Daughter of the Stars , sound is continually captured
and recirculated within the buffer of the grain delay, allowing
for the creation of multi-layered sound without fixed media.
A recent development was the adaptation of the EV software
as a processing tool for external instruments. Much like classic
synthesizers—such as the Korg MS-20—that allow external sig-
nals to be routed through their internal signal chains, the EV
software was repurposed for use in experiments from the n-space ,
a composition for HYPERCUBE: a quartet of saxophone, guitar,
piano, and percussion. The result was compelling: the compo-
sition has timbral and aesthetic similarities to the EV, but cast
onto a different instrumental framework, merging the quartet’s
acoustic voices with the EV’s processing paradigm.
6.4.1 Latency Measurement. Latency was measured at 27 ms
total (figure 6). Performing an acoustic-to-acoustic round-trip
latency measurement, a microphone was placed next to the EV
string, and another next to the output speaker; a string was
then plucked with the software configured to pass the signal un-
modified. Recorded in Audacity, the distance between transients
was measured. Sources of latency include: the Bela ADC buffer
(360 𝜇s) [18], circular buffer (360 𝜇s) (section 6.2), OSC and USB
transmission, PD receiving circular buffer (5 ms) (section 6.2),pd~
subprocess (2.9 ms), PD buffer delay (5 ms), and the UAD Apollo
output latency.

Table 1: Latency sources and their known contributions.
With the measured sources totaling 13.6 ms, the soundcard
and USB latency can be calculated at 13.4 ms. Additional latency
is incurred with the use of the envelope follower: 5 ms, (for a
total of 33 ms) likely introduced by the low-pass filter smoothing
stages (section 5.2). Furthermore, the addition of FFT convolution
adds latency equivalent to the length of the analysis window. For
example, a 256-sample analysis window adds 6 ms (bringing the
total to 39 ms of latency).
6.4.2 Pitch Detection Analysis. A comparative analysis was per-
formed between zDet~ and sigmund~ to evaluate how the zero-
crossing detector performed against an established industry stan-
dard within the context of the EV. The EV was tuned to standard
viola tuning, and an ascending major scale was played on each
string. sigmund~ was used with default settings (1024-sample
window, 512-sample hop size, and a 50,ms analysis delay). Each
detector’s output was sampled at 100 Hz during the performance.
The two recorded output streams were re-synchronized to ac-
count for sigmund~’s inherent delay and charted in figure 7. In
conclusion, zDet~ performed comparably, with 50 ms less latency
and fewer dramatic misreadings during note onsets.

7 Future Work
The EV has developed into a robust tool for both studio and
performance applications. That said, much work lies ahead in
continuing to improve portability, latency, sensor accuracy, and
aesthetic. The design for EV 3 is currently underway, aiming to
address these issues.
EV 3 will be self-contained, with onboard processing handled
by four Bela Minis (one per string). This design eliminates the
need for a laptop and audio interface, simplifying setup. The
GUI interface will be ported to a wirelessly-connected tablet
application. An additional benefit will be reduced latency: the
Bela’s sub-2 ms round-trip latency [18] outperforms the current
27 ms (section 6). With a dedicated Bela per string, the audio input
will be used, affording the use of the lower-noise delta-sigma

converter. This is expected to improve the current SNR beyond
the current 60 dB (section 6.4). In addition, this will hopefully
solve an issue where the current envelope follower andthreshold ~
object struggle to detect quiet notes close to the noise floor.
While the past two EV versions are 3D-printed plastic, EV
3 will be CNC-machined from curly maple. This will provide
three improvements. First, it allows for a smooth, finished neck
surface, as might be expected from a traditional instrument. In
previous iterations, the bottom of the neck was buttressed by
supports when printing, leaving a slightly rough feel. Second,
the use of maple increases structural stiffness. Although tough
PLA supported by carbon fiber rods was used for EV 2.5, the
neck still flexed slightly under tension, a limitation the wooden
construction is expected to overcome. Finally, the aesthetic of
wood is valued in instrument design. It will be interesting to see
how this material affects the instrument’s visual presentation.
Although the use of embedded computing has many benefits, a
drawback will be a limited processing capability. To mitigate this,
the current PD software is being ported to an efficiency-oriented
C++ version.
As the EV reaches a more refined state, user feedback surveys
will be conducted. At this earlier stage, development has been
driven by the author’s own usage and reflective evaluation.
Lastly, there remain exciting software possibilities to be im-
plemented—particularly physical modeling. EV 2.5 includes a
rudimentary physical model based on the Karplus-Strong algo-
rithm. However, the potential of physical modeling remains to
be thoroughly implemented, aiming to explore the hybridization
of real and virtual sound within composition.
8 Conclusion
Over the past four years, the EV project has evolved from an
idea into a fully functional instrument with a distinct sonic iden-
tity. Initial experiments with EV 1 demonstrated the creative
potential of cross-synthesis between the instrument’s acoustic
and electronic sound. Though constrained by rudimentary and
unreliable hardware, the convolution algorithms revealed their
capacity to carry the expressive nuance of a trained string player
into the realm of synthesized sound. EV 2 aimed to address the
many limitations of the initial prototype, particularly the con-
straints imposed by the retrofitted viola body and homemade
circuitry. Embracing digital fabrication, the development of a
custom-designed body and use of manufactured PCBs solved
many issues of reliability. However, these changes also intro-
duced a host of new problems, leading to the development of EV
2.5. Resolving the majority of hardware issues allowed the expan-
sion of the instrument’s software capabilities, opening the way
for new sonic possibilities. The increased reliability allowed the
instrument to be brought from the studio to the stage, imbuing the
author’s electro-acoustic compositions with the performance dy-
namics typically associated with live string performance. While
much work lies ahead, the guiding question remains: What excit-
ing new music is the EV creating right now?
9 Ethical Standards
This project was undertaken within the standards of the NIME
Principles & Code of Practice on Ethical Research. The design
and fabrication of the EV across versions 1, 2, and 2.5 involved
iterative prototyping processes that necessarily generate mate-
rial byproducts. Every effort has been made to minimize waste
by repurposing components and reusing materials across ver-
sions wherever feasible. When reuse was not possible, compo-
nents were recycled using the most responsible methods available.
There are no observed conflicts of interest in this project.
