ABSTRACT
We explore the phenomenology of embodiment based on re-
search through design and reﬂection on the design of arte-
facts for augmenting embodied performance. We present
three designs for highly trained musicians; the designs rely
on the musicians’ mastery acquired from years of practice.
Through the knowledge of the living body their instru-
ments —saxophone, cello, and ﬂute — are extensions of
themselves; thus, we can explore technology with rich nu-
ances and precision in corporeal schemas. With the help of
Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of embodiment we present
three hypotheses for augmented embodied performance: the
extended artistic room, the interactively enacted teacher,
and the humanisation of technology.

1. INTRODUCTION
We need to be critical to the digitalisation and automation
and consequently the dehumanisation of industry and ser-
vices. In a completely digitalised world the body as our
living expression in the world withdraw to the background.
We seem to need our bodies mainly as a mechanical inter-
face to the devices. The radical digitalisation and automa-
tion will rise questions on what role we will have as humans
and what it is to be human in this world [17, 15]. How-
ever, in post-digital art and embodied interaction we can
explore the interplay between the analogue and the digi-
tal, between the body and the machine [1]. In the last one
and a half decade, since Dourish [3] presented embodied in-
teraction to the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) ﬁeld,
the HCI and interaction design research community has had
embodied interaction as ubiquitous theme. The 1990s’ had
brought ubiquitous computing (UbiComp) [22] and tangible
user interfaces (TUI) [8]. Both these ﬁelds are still vital and

reinvent themselves, Ubicomp has transformed into Inter-
net of Things (IoT) whereas TUI continues to thrive in the
design research community. The technology focus of Ubi-
Comp and TUI was founded in a notion that the computer
interface ought to be richer than mouse-keyboard-screen.
Dourish put this in a more intellectual and sociologically
grounded perspective. He brought the interaction design
community’s attention to Dreyfus [4], how shows that the
Merleau-Ponty’s [13] Phenomenology of Embodiment is rel-
evant to the world of computing. More recently, H¨o¨ok et al.
[7] presented Somaesthetic Appreciation as a strong concept
to create embodied interaction, and to focus on the being-
in-the-world where presence in time and in space matters,
where the actual shape and innate capacities and rhythm
of the human body make the conditions for a design.
In this paper, we explore embodied interaction with clas-
sically trained musicians. We focus on performance, the
rich actions our bodies can, and that physical actions are
both faster and more nuanced than symbolic cognition in
interaction design [10]. Merleau-Ponty describes the liv-
ing body as being in between concrete and abstract bodily
movements, where the concrete refers to movements related
to a known world and the abstract refers to movements in
an as-if-world [13]. We are always open to the abstract
and unfamiliar albeit we most often live in the concrete and
familiar. Merleau-Ponty illustrates this with an example
of a skilled organist who has to play an unfamiliar organ.
An hour before a concert the organist manages to get ac-
quainted with the instrument. Here, the musician adjusts
his embodied knowledge of playing an organ, without men-
tal representing or learning of the unfamiliar organ. With a
similar intent, we introduced designs for the musicians that,
on one hand, relied on their acquired embodied skills and
their repertoire of concrete movements, and that, on the
other hand, challenged those skills. The designs introduce
unfamiliarity to a familiar situation; thus, as with Merleau-
Ponty’s example with the organ player, adjusting the world
for the musicians. This revealed new embodied relations be-
tween the musicians; the saxophone, cello, and ﬂute; and,
the designs.
2. RELATED PROJECTS
We introduce three designs —MIST, Whirlpool Bach, and
Critical Digitalism — to explore embedded interaction. The
ﬁrst project visually augment the performance of a solo sax-
ophonist using audiovisual input, the second project visu-
ally augment the performance of a solo cellist using biosig-
nals of muscles, and the last project utilise live sampling to
augment the performance musically based on biosignals of
muscles. There are many related projects in the past decade
that relies on similar approaches. This section present a se-
lection of projects that provide a context for our work. Gra-
ham and Bridges [6] presents a design for mapping strate-
77
gies in a performance system that combines motion detec-
tion and feature extraction to manage multichannel audio
material in improvisation. Their design utilises a Microsoft
Kinect and extends the artist performance with bodily ges-
tures similar to, but also more sophisticated than our MIST
project. Like Graham and Bridges, other projects have
studied mapping strategies of gestures. Visi et al. [21] de-
signed a gesture mapping system based on embodied mu-
sic cognition for performance to be used in performance to
enhance the expressiveness and the liveness that provides
an extra layer of possible motions and musical expressions
over the instrument. Beside visual and aural technologies,
Donnarumma [2] explored gesture control using mechanical
myography (MMG) audio signals. The aim of the design
was to make biological signals the main audio and control
source. Donnarumma also aimed at making a perceivable
connection between the performer’s kinesthetic expressions
and the sound for both the audience and the performer.
Application of techniques for acoustic feedback controllers
(AFCS) to diﬀerent contexts, such as musical performance,
sound installations, and product design, presents a unique
insight into the research embodied audio interfaces and en-
vironments. Van Troyer [20] illustrates with three proto-
types novel designs for AFCS used in diﬀerent environments
sonically augmented environments based on users’ audible
actions. Besides extending performance and musical expres-
sion via gestures embodied interaction is also used for novel
interfaces. Yamaguchi et al. [23] designed a wireless music
interface in the form of a ball. The performers’ movements
and grip pressure control various parameters in a musical
process. The design is loosening the link between the phys-
ical object and how it sounds and thus provides freedom
in the physical performance, for instance allowing the per-
formers to play the instrument through dance. Whereas,
Tahiroglu et al. [19] designed an instrument —Network
of Intelligent Sonic Agents (NOISA) — with a tight cou-
pling between appearance and sound to explore physical
interaction in performance with emphasis on engagement.
Their focus was on a novel design where they increased
their performance skills with the instrument through re-
hearsal and training. The novel design implies that it will
take time and practice before the users acquire embodied
artist skills. Another approach is to augment traditional
instruments relying on the trained movement schema of the
artists. For instance, McPherson [11] augmented the pi-
ano with a portable optical measurement system designed
for capturing continuous key motion. The design enables
the pianist to be more expressive and adjust a broader and
continues range of parameters of the played note. This in-
creases the world of the instrument; the performers need
to expand their abilities and their living bodies knowledge
the this augmented piano. Capturing the motions of the
artist can also be used for training purposes. Menzies and
McPherson [12] created a digital bagpipe chanter system
to assist in one-to-one piping tuition. The system allows
students to record and see a visualisation of their perfor-
mances. They designed the hardware to accurately and
quickly detect continuous ﬁnger movements of the player to
allow a nuanced input. Various forms of sensors can be used
for input in novel designs. Donnarumma [2], above, devel-
oped a sensor to measure and sonify mechanical vibration
of muscles. Jaimovich [9] presented the work of Emovere:
an interactive real-time performance that uses physiolog-
ical signals from dancers to propel a piece that explores
and reﬂects on the relations between biology and emotions.
Jaimovich focuses on the design of collaborative tools and
materials, he contributes to the creation of artistic projects
working with dancers and physiological signals. The design
uses muscle sensors electromyogram (EMG) and electrocar-
diogram (ECG) that measures the heart activity. The use of
biosignals in interactive art is not particularly widespread;
albeit there is a tradition in a small community of interac-
tive art artist to use biosignals that goes back since the early
1960s. A growing number of artists have since then collabo-
rated with neuroscientists and engineers to design methods
that enable the acquisition of minimal electrical signals of
the living body. This has enabled direct manifestations of
embodiment into interactive artworks.
3. METHODOLOGICAL NOTE
Out method for the work in this paper is based on designing
or supervising the design of artefacts through a ”conversa-
tion with the materials of a situation” that intervene in the
practice of train musicians. We relied on Sch ¨ons [16] re-
ﬂection—on—action to formulate our thesis on embodied
augmented interaction grounded in the design process and
experiences of the designs. We have grounded our theories
of the designs in research through design, presenting exam-
ples of designs [5, 24], reﬂections on the designs, and the
view of Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of embodiment [4,
13].
4. MIST
The Music Interaction Symbiosis Technology (MIST) (Fig-
ure 1) design used audio amplitude and frequency spectrum
features to control a visual particle system and particle
ﬂow. The system used a Microsoft Kinect connected to
a computer programmed with OpenFrameworks. A profes-
sional saxophone player collaborated in the design process
to explore how the system could augment the players per-
formance. The presence of the player body aﬀorded a design
in later iterations to include a luminous image of the player
on the screen where the bursts of particles originated from.
Instead of mapping gestures to symbols [6, 21], we mapped
the movements and audio to a continues visual ﬂow. In
performance, the artist described how he tried to make the
performance more visually interesting. This the design be-
came an extension to the saxophone expanding the artistic
space.

4.1 Whirlpool Bach
The visual augmentation of the MIST project inspired us
to further explored the interplay between visuals and the
performance of a trained musician. In the Whirlpool Bach
project, we created a visual augmentation of a cello player
performance via controlling the framerate of a video display-
ing water whirlpools in a stream (Figure 2). The stream is
78
part of a channel used in the eighteenth and nineteenth cen-
turies to ship iron, then the most important export of Swe-
den. Today, all the mines and mills are closed. Using the
electromyography (EMG) signal to reverse the whirlpools
of the stream while playing Bach’s cello suites symbolis-
ing transience of industry and nostalgia for what has been.
When the player relaxes the stream start to ﬂow forward,
washing away the past.
Figure 2: Performance at the Norberg festival 2014
We used a custom build EMG sensor connected via a
data acquisition (DAQ) device to a computer programmed
with the data ﬂow programming language LabVIEW (Fig-
ure 3). Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Work-
bench (LabVIEW) is an electronics system-design platform
development environment. The LabVIEW program sends
open sound control (OSC) messages with the muscle signal
amplitude values from the 20 - 50 Hz band to another com-
puter running a QuartzComposer program. QuartzCom-
poser is a data ﬂow programming language designed to ma-
nipulate multimedia. This program manipulates the video
frame rate based on the muscle amplitude.
Figure 3: Custom build EMG sensor
The artist described an increased awareness of her move-
ment while playing. Where Menzies and McPherson [12]
introduced a sophisticated design for learning visualising
the performance with precision, we mapped the body sig-
nal with a looser connection between the movement and
the visual expression. Even so, the artist was consciously
reﬂecting in action on her body ”not just the cello.” This is
to one end making subconscious movement conscious thus
making deprecating the embodied presence, however to an-
other end it makes the artist reﬂecting on her actions; thus,
the technology acts as a teacher. The interplay between
the in action and on action is what Sch ¨on [16] describes as
learning and expanding one’s repertoire.
5. CRITICAL DIGITALISM
Critical Digitalism explores embodied interaction and aug-
mented acoustic performance utilising biometric signals (Fig-
ure 4). The music was performed on a ﬂute, an analogue
synthesiser, and computer running a custom built live sam-
pling and loop player software. The software samples four
seconds and played back twelve seconds completing six-
teen seconds cycles of sampling and playback, four bars
in common time based on the larghetto tempo, 60 beats
per minute. The music loops are ﬁeld samples of fans in
academic institutions and a time stretched reversed piano
chord. Thus, all sound sources are either acoustic or ana-
logue.
Figure 4: Critical Digitalism, ﬂute, synthesiser and
computer performance 2016
Figure 5: EMG Sensor connected to Arduino
In this design, an electromyography (EMG) signal, mea-
suring the muscle signal amplitude, aﬀects the grain size
of a live sampled acoustic and analog performance utilis-
ing granular synthesis. The digital signal processing and
music programming is based on the Processing Beads au-
dio library [14]. The Beads’ granular synthesis manipulates
79
the time-domain of the time—frequency space of a signal.
The MyoWare Muscle Sensor is connected to an Arduino
micro controller running Firmata allowing the Arduino to
be programmed via Processing (Figure 5). The sound of
the acoustic ﬂute and the analogue synthesiser is reversed
and stuttered like an old pin printer or disc-drive. High
muscle tension calms the lengthens the grains and relax the
signal; this mapping implies constant tension in the muscles
of the performer or in the ears of the audience. Touching
the MacBook trackpad blends samples based on distance to
the touch. Thus, the digital instrument was played though
very light swipe gestures. This design included many el-
ements —touchpad, synthesiser, ﬂute, and sensor. Thus
playing the piece was moving between focusing the diﬀer-
ent parts and reading the whole situation (including the
audience). Jaimovich [9] described the diﬃculties for the
dancers to map dance to music; however, we experienced
in this project that the complexity was not a diﬃculty but
instead created another layer of situation awareness that
demanded a conscious thought to gear the performance in
a desirable direction.
6. DISCUSSION
We can formulate three themes of augmented performance
on the basis of embodiment and Merleau-Ponty: the ex-
tended artistic room, the interactively enacted teacher, and
the humanization of technology.
6.1 The Extended Artistic Room
According to Merleau-Ponty [13], the embodied subject is
deeply intertwined with the world on a pre-reﬂective level.
Actually, much what we normally ascribe to ”mental life”
happens here. The world is conceived as a constant am-
biguous calling, and the embodied subject responds to this
by interrogating the world with its capacities to perceive
and act. In the dialectic between world and the lived body
both the world and the subject take shape as something
meaningful to each other.
For the saxophone player in the MIST-project this means
that the physical reality of the concert hall and the audi-
ence is a latent possibility of a musical world. The saxo-
phone player is responding to this calling by playing the
saxophone. In this, he is at one and the same time perceiv-
ing and acting with the pre-reﬂective intention to call forth
this world into being. The means to this are his habitual
embodiment as a musician where the saxophone is one with
the lived body. The saxophone is actually not noted as a
thing in itself but only through the eﬀects of playing it. And
through attending to the musical idea and applying sponta-
neous creative eﬀort in playing the saxophone the musical
room comes to life. The room is ﬁlled with music, the audi-
ence becomes the ”listeners” and ”enjoyers” of the music and
the saxophone player becomes the ”joyful performer.” But
this is not static. With every sound the saxophone player
is responding to the world before him and at one and the
same time perceiving, acting, and enacting it.
It is important to recognize that this is a socially con-
structed event. The saxophonist is performing as countless
saxophonists have done before him. He is the now incar-
nated endpoint of at tradition making a performance in an
almost traditional way with his skill and his music. It does
not feel socially constructed or traditional though. In the
act of playing it feels as the most natural and important
thing to do and in the sense that the player is creative he is
not weighed down by tradition. But through the MIST visu-
alisation system a non-traditional element is introduced to
the performance. Theoretically this could destroy it. But,
we found out that the saxophone player could easily adapt
to this and attach the new possibility to his performance.
Furthermore, in the iterative design process he suggested
improvements of the design, the appearance of his silhou-
ette as the origin of particles, and a more deterministic ﬂow
of particle making it possible to perform loops of music and
visuals that emphasise the connection between the music
and the visuals. He now had the opportunity not only to
respond to and create the room with music but also with
something visual. This opens for new artistic possibilities.
We all know the diﬀerence between watching a movie with-
out sound or music. But, what is interesting here is that
this is done in real time as a spontaneous part of the per-
formance. In this sense, the artistic room gets extended.
6.2 The Interactively Enacted Teacher
According to Merleau-Ponty [13] the key to the embodied
subject or the lived body is habit. But here we must refrain
from the idea that habits are more or less mechanical re-
sponses to the environment. They are learned ways to per-
ceive and act that works intentionally but on a pre-reﬂective
level. There are always habits in everything we do in every
part of our lives. Habits can be described on three levels.
They are the concrete habits that I am at this moment, the
lived body as it is right now. But they are also the sedi-
mented habits that I have acquired but lies dormant as a
background with a potential meaning to what I am doing
now. Finally they are also what I could imagining myself
doing as abstract habits that I have the capability to learn.
The habits are collected into corporeal schemas. These
are more encompassing attitudes that can be described as
my embodied perspective containing both perception and
action pertaining to a certain world. The corporeal schema
is a whole that is more than the sum of the habits that
constitute it. It is at one and the same time an immediate
knowing of how my lived body is conﬁgured at the moment
and of the kind of world I am trying to respond to. It
can be changed by incorporating and letting go of habits.
It is rough in the novice and reﬁned in the master. But
even then the corporeal schema can be fully adequate. The
novice musician can awaken as enthusiastic responses from
its parents as the master can do from the concert hall au-
dience. The corporeal schema always admits spontaneous
improvisation but in a low degree in the novice and a high
degree in the master. It takes a very well developed corpo-
real schema to master a musical instrument. It is through
this development that the instrument eventually becomes a
part of the musicians lived body barely noticed.
In Whirlpool Bach we investigated the corporeal schema
with the help of a cellist in the later years of her training.
With the introduction of the EMG sensor and the visual
performance a new element was introduced to her corpo-
real schema. It had the eﬀect of transforming her concrete
habits of playing in the moment to abstract habits open for
reﬂection. In one way this interrupted her performance. She
started to reﬂect on her body as an object rather than living
it as a subject and the free ﬂowing movement between the
lived body and a world of music could not be upholded. But
the interruption on the other hand was relevant to what she
was doing. She could use it to reﬂect on how she actually
lived her body while playing the cello enabling adjustments
to the corporeal schema.
One way to conceptualise this is that the cellist used the
EMG sensor and the visual performance as cultural ob-
jects.She could understand them according to their use as
a way to monitor her muscles during her performance. We
would rather argue that the cultural objects that advanced
technology makes possible takes on a ”higher” meaning in
this situation. To be aware of another human being as a
80
subject is understood by Merleau-Ponty as the actual per-
ception in the world of another who intentionally perceives
and acts in the world. In comparison with this we feel that
a lot of today’s technology has reached the level of ”quasi-
subjectness”. A lot of the devices that surrounds us are not
really possible to conceive as mere cultural objects calling
us to be used (albeit possibly creatively). We all feel that
they in some sense also perceive us and we can perceive
them perceiving us. It is in this meaning that we would
not conceptualise the EMG sensor and the visual perfor-
mance as mere biofeedback through cultural objects but as
an interactively enacted teacher.
6.3 The Humanisation of Technology
There is no real distinction between humanity and technol-
ogy. Technology has always been ”humaine” in one way or
another. It is simply an extension and empowerment of the
capacities of perceiving and acting that are already there in
our embodiment [13]. But technology is ”inhumaine” in the
sense that it has most often actualised delimited parts of the
human potential to be put in service to interests directed
by production and consumption and ultimately proﬁt. The
human is a producer and consumer for sure but we are so
many other things. Among a range of things we feel, love,
play, create, socialize and reﬂect on the mystery of being
alive. Today’s technology are of course more responsive to
this than ever before. For instance our social capabilities
are enlarged by smartphones and internet of things.
We design Critical Digitalism to have a more intimate re-
lationship between the musician and the technology. The
project is also autobiographical based on previous examples
of exploring embodied augmented performance using ki-
naesthetic creativity in combination with technology. Svanæs
[18] introduces kinaesthetic creativity to enable the body
to be part of the design process. ”Kinaesthetic creativity
makes it possible not only to use the body in the design
process as an object to be studied or as a vehicle for acting
out proposed solutions, but also to create design processes
and environments that will take advantage of the ability of
designers and users to explore and enact alternative futures
through abstract movements.” [18] However, our focus was
on concrete moments, or rather learning through interaction
with instruments on the basis of acquired skill as described
above: the Interactively Enacted Teacher. Jaimovich [9],
tried to connect the dancers to sound parameters making
them being musicians, playing the instrument. However,
this design had to be discarded because of the dancers not
being familiarized with a musical-performer motions. The
dancers worked with the whole of their bodies and control-
ling separate parameters with certain muscle was not part
of their embodied kinesthetic knowledge. This is an impor-
tant diﬀerence from our work, where we used the knowl-
edge of the living body to augment the performance with
appended layers. Using the kinaesthetic creativity in per-
forming with the instrument, the acoustic technology, the
analogue synthesiser with its buttons, knobs, and patch ca-
bles, and the computer trackpad we designed interactive
technology ”sees”the human. However, we can say that even
the clunky laptop, the mechanic typewriter before it, or the
smartphone sees the human too. However in the strive to
not dehumanise users into screen tapping ﬁngers, embodied
interaction calls for more rich interaction that can ”see” the
humans’ nuances and precision in their bodily motions. The
digitalisation and automation of industry and services can
learn from interactive art, critical design, and interaction
design. Designing for embodied interaction allows users to
be seen as humans. The technologies’ more complex and
nuanced embodied perception calls for more sophisticated
interaction technology to become more humane.
