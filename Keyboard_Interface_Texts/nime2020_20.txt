ABSTRACT
In NIME design, thorough attention has been devoted to
feedback modalities, including auditory, visual and hap-
tic feedback. How the performer executes the gestures to
achieve a sound on an instrument, by contrast, appears to
be less examined. Previous research showed that auditory
imagery, or the ability to hear or recreate sounds in the
mind even when no audible sound is present, is essential
to the sensorimotor control involved in playing an instru-
ment. In this paper, we enquire whether auditory imagery
can also help to support skill transfer between musical in-
struments resulting in possible implications for new instru-
ment design. To answer this question, we performed two
experimental studies on pitch accuracy and fluency where
professional violinists were asked to play a modified violin.
Results showed altered or even possibly irrelevant auditory
feedback on a modified violin does not appear to be a sig-
nificant impediment to performance. However, performers
need to have coherent imagery of what they want to do,
and the sonic outcome needs to be coupled to the motor
program to achieve it. This finding shows that the design
paradigm should be shifted from a direct feedback model of
instrumental playing toward a model where imagery guides
the playing process. This result is in agreement with recent
research on skilled sensorimotor control that highlights the
value of feedforward anticipation in embodied musical per-
formance. It is also of primary importance for the design of
new instruments: new sounds that cannot easily be imag-
ined and that are not coupled to a motor program are not
likely to be easily performed on the instrument.

Such a limitation may constitute one of the constraints to
the development of expertise and performative practices
for new instruments. Expertise is sometimes discussed in
NIME in the context of instruments allowing expressivity
[21], facilitating the development of virtuosity [3], or within
the reports of players who used particular instruments over
an extended period of time [15]. Existing expertise is also
discussed as an element to preserve to shorten the training
needed to master an instrument [3, 13, 18]. However, the
role of expertise in guiding design decisions is still relatively
under-explored.
This paper specifically looks at questions of using expert
musicians’ existing skills to embody a new or modified in-
strument. The focus is placed on the type of expertise that
allow players to hear or recreate sounds in the mind even
when no audible sound is present [4]. Such capability is
generally referred to asauditory imagery and is a funda-
mental component of music execution where players do not
consciously think about the instrument [8].
A performer study was designed to include twelve profes-
sional violinists, who engaged in a series of musical tasks
involving auditory imagery to assess to what extent expert
musicians can preserve their expertise when playing unfa-
miliar sounds, and under which circumstances expert musi-
cians’ auditory imagery could support performance fluency
of new sounds.
2. BACKGROUND
Auditory imagery and auditory feedback can be described
as two core components of instrumental performance [19,
22, 24]. Auditory imagery relates to the ability to hear or
recreate sounds in the mind even when no audible sound is
present [4] and is part of a feedforward process where mu-
sicians generate expectations about the sound they want
to execute [23]. Auditory feedback may be defined as the
sound produced in response to musicians’ physical actions
on a musical instrument. Such feedback allows players to
tune their performing and achieve subtle adjustments with
respect to intonation and articulation. This process particu-
larly characterises traditional musical executions, where the
musician has an embodied relationship with the instrument
[14]. During the performance, musicians can subconsciously
formulate auditory expectations of what the sound will be
[1], perform detailed sensory-motor tasks on their instru-
ment to achieve it [8], and eventually adjust their playing by
comparing those expectations against the auditory feedback
coming from the instrument [8]. Auditory images also func-
tion as a bridge between perception and action [2], leading
to activation in motor planning areas that serves to guide
planning movement [5].
Auditory feedback has been extensively investigated with
different strategies, including altering the sound coming
from the instrument [16, 17, 6]. This study partially builds

upon the research presented in [12]. Specifically, it repli-
cates part of the methodologies used to study musicians’
reactions to altered auditory feedback and builds upon some
of its research findings. In [12], a selected group of profes-
sional violinists were asked to engage in a series of musical
tasks involving a violin featuring reversed strings. Hence,
the connection between violinists’ auditory expectations (au-
ditory imagery) and the motor programs to produce the in-
tended sounds was disrupted. Given the reordering of the
strings, a gesture that would have usually produced a partic-
ular note, resulted in a different note and thus an unfamiliar
auditory feedback.
During the study, violinists were asked to play a move-
ment of a Bach partita. Subsequently they were asked to
play the same music notation with the same violin as if
the strings were not reversed, ignoring the auditory feed-
back. Players performances were analysed concerning dura-
tion and pitch accuracy. Findings suggest that participants
were able to play more accurately and fluently when they
ignored the auditory feedback coming from the violin and
instead focused on their auditory expectations and motor
programs to meet them. The study presented in this paper
builds upon the results of the mentioned paper to establish
auditory imagery as a critical component to support skill
transfer between musical instruments.
3. METHODOLOGY
Auditory imagery is part of a process that unfolds subcon-
sciously where actions are accomplished without conscious
thought. Hence posing direct questions to musicians could
potentially lead to biased information. James, in his Prin-
ciples of Psychology, writes ”We are then aware of nothing
between the conception and the execution. All sorts of neu-
romuscular processes come between... but we know abso-
lutely nothing of them. We think the act, and it is done”
[7]. Existing literature presents how auditory imagery can
be queried using the measurement of physiological responses
and performance-based tasks [1]. In the study presented in
this paper, musicians were asked to perform musical assign-
ments following a pre-defined protocol. Corrective effects,
and mistakes were considered as data to test a series of
research hypotheses.
Raw data from the study can be found at this link.
4. PERFORMER STUDY
This study was designed to examine expert musicians’ abil-
ity to use auditory imagery to play in tune in the presence
of familiar and unfamiliar sounds.
The term familiar material describes musical notes and
music passages situated in the Western tonal music tradi-
tion. These sounds, which are generally referred to as semi-
tones, are familiar for their being coherent with the type of
studies and training followed by the selected violinists. For
these music events, familiarity reflects both in the auditory
imagery developed while studying the instrument and by
the auditory feedback produced by playing it. The term
unfamiliar pitch materialrefers to quarter tones. Quarter
tones were chosen for being rare in the Western traditional
music repertoire. Hence, a type of pitch material for which
the selected violinists did not have a developed auditory
imagery.
The study was divided into two parts. Tasks involving
semitones and quarter tones are situated in the first part
and refers to the following research questionhow accurately
can violinists play pitch material for which they do not have
a developed auditory imagery? If the actual target sound is
unfamiliar, how does that differ in terms of accuracy and

response time to being able to play ordinary chromatic music
on a violin?Our hypothesis is that even expert musicians,
when confronted with pitch material sitting outside their
auditory imagery, will perform with lower accuracy. If this
hypothesis was confirmed, we could highlight a fundamen-
tal limitation of making a new instrument. If a particular
musical feature does not feed into a kind of culturally de-
fined structure of how people think they hear music, then
they struggle to play.
In the second part of the study,unfamiliar pitch material
defines the notes coming from a re-tuned violin. In that
case, unfamiliarity reflects in the unexpected auditory feed-
back coming from the violin. Executing the gesture to play
a specific note, because of the re-tuning, resulted in the
instrument producing a different note. This modification
challenged the expectations of the violinists and therefore,
their auditory imagery. Tasks involving the re-tuned vi-
olin referred to the research questionto what extent does
performers’ pitch accuracy and fluency deteriorate in the
presence of an unfamiliar auditory feedback and mismatched
auditory imagery? Does their performance improve if the
task allows participants to ignore the sound coming from the
violin and to focus on their internal representation of sound
(i.e. their auditory imagery)?
4.1 Participants
Auditory imagery is an ability well-developed by players
with at least seven years of training [25]. For this reason,
only musicians holding an ABRSM’s Grade 71 and above
were selected.
Twelve participants in an age range between 22 and 46
years old were selected with an open call sent through music
schools. Each violinist filled a questionnaire before begin-
ning the study indicating the years of training, the type
of repertoire that characterised their study and their per-
forming, and their familiarity with string instruments re-
tuning. All accepted violinists were trained in the Western
music repertoire, were unfamiliar with quarter tones and
with string instruments re-tuning (scordatura).
4.2 Quarter-tone performance
The first part of the study tests the presence of already-
existing auditory imagery for pitches outside the Western
traditional music repertoire. Violinists engaged in a series of
tasks involving quarter tones. The execution was evaluated
regarding accuracy in pitch and time response comparing
semitones and quarter tones. The underlying assumption
is that participant’s auditory imagery of quarter tones is
vaguer than for semitones. Therefore, it could be possible
to see pitch accuracy be lower during tasks involving quarter
tones compared to semitones.
4.2.1 Procedure
Violinists were asked to play semitones and quarter tones
notes with their personal violin in three separate condi-
tions: notation A, audio playback, notation B. Violinists
were asked to avoid using vibrato in their executions. The

sic) is an accredited board awarding exams and diploma

audio section was used to discriminate notation effects com-
ing from reading the unfamiliar symbols describing quarter
tones. Quarter tones were notated using the symbolsgi j lm.
Table 1 present the number of stimuli for each section. In
each section single notes were shown on a monitor one at a
time, then intervals were shown one at a time with the same
modality. Every single note and every melodic interval was
presented only once to each participant to prevent biases re-
sulting from playing the same stimulus twice (i.e. potential
learning effects). The first note of melodic intervals (which
was always a semitone2) served to provide a context to the
second note (the actual stimulus which could be a semitone
or a quarter tone). The reason for having two notation sec-
tions (one at the beginning and one at the end) was to test
whether having the quarter tones presented as audio would
improve pitch accuracy when going back to playing from
notation.
The audio coming from the violin was recorded with a
DPA microphone and analysed to measure pitch deviation
for each played note. The monophonic pitch tracking algo-
rithm pYin [10] was used to measure pitch accuracy of par-
ticipants’ executions. Each note recording was segmented
into start (100 ms following the attack phase), mean (the
time interval following the start the note up to the 100 ms
before the end of the note), and end (the last 100ms before
the violin bow detached from the strings of the violin).To
measure the pitch deviation we calculated the expected fre-
quencyfE (n) as
fe(n) =m02dn/12
where m0 is the average frequency of the first note (the
lowest G), anddn is the difference in semitones between the
note n and the lowest G. We then calculated the accuracy
of the played note at different moments by calculating, for
each note, the error in cents for the beginningaBn and the
end of the noteaEn and for the mean frequencyaMn
aBn = 1200∗ log2(mBn/fEn)
aEn = 1200∗ log2(mEn/fEn)
aMn = 1200∗ log2(mMn/fEn)
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted to assess the
significance of the comparison between absolute values of
the pitch deviation for semitones and quarter tones in the
three considered phases of the note ( start, mean and end)
for notation A plus audio playback plus notation B data,
notation A plus notation B data, audio playback data. We
also measured the time interval between each single note
being presented as a notation and the start of its execu-
tion. Specifically, we used a light sensor which measured
a blinking box on the display each time a new notation
stimulus was presented. The recording of the sensor was
synchronous with the audio recording of the violin. Both
signals were recorded using Bela [11], a low-latency plat-
form for sensor and audio processing. The significance of
the comparison between time response for semitones and
quarter tones was assessed with Wilcoxon signed-rank test
across the two notation sections (A, and B). For this paper,
we are only presenting the data coming from the analysis
of the single notes. Data from the analysis of the intervals
will be part of a future publication.
4.2.2 Semitones versus quarter tones
Data from notation A, audio playback, and notation B sec-
tions revealed that semitones were performed with better
pitch accuracy and with a shorter time response than quar-
ter tones.
Pitch was more accurate at the beginning of semitones
with a mean pitch deviation of 26.91 vs 42.13 cents. This
result was statistically significant with p≈ 5.34E-14 and a
moderate effect size 0.23. Pitch was also more accurate for
semitones in the mean of performers’ playing with a mean
pitch deviation of 18.09 vs 32.73 cents (p≈ 7.8E-23 and
effect size 0.30), and at the end of the note with 17.20 vs
31.70 cents (p≈ 2.25E-23 and effect size 0.30).
In the notation sections A plus B semitones were per-
formed sooner than quarter tones with a mean time re-
sponse of 1.52 vs 1.90 seconds. Statistical significance for
this comparison is p≈ 6.11E-09, effect size 0.39.
Table 2 presents a summary of data from this section.
4.2.3 Notation A plus Notation B versus audio
Data from Notation A section plus data from the Nota-
tion B sections shows that semitones were played more ac-
curately than quarter tones at the beginning of the notes
with a mean pitch deviation of 26.38 vs 40.92 cents, and p
≈3.12E-06. However effect size was small at 0.20. Pitch
was also more accurate for semitones in the mean, and the
end of performers’ executions with a mean pitch deviation
of 22.60 vs 40.04 cents (p≈ 8.18E-11, effect size 0.28), and
22.1 vs 39.519 cents (p≈ 2.00E-10, effect size 0.28). In the
audio section, semitones were still played more accurately
than quarter tones with a mean pitch deviation of 27.43
vs 43.32 cents (p≈ 2.37E-09, effect size 0.26) at the start,
13.64 vs 25.52 cents (p≈ 4.14E-14, effect size 0.33) in the
mean, and 12.37 vs 23.99 cents (p≈ 2.52E-15, effect size
0.34) at the end of the executions.
In the beginning of the notes, the intonation for semi-
tones and quarter tones was more accurate in the notation
section. By contrast, during the mean and the end of the
notes, intonation for semitones and quarter tones was more
accurate in the audio section.
4.3 Re-tuned Violin
In part 2, participants were asked to perform a series of
music passages with a re-tuned violin. Because of the violin
re-tuning, imagining a certain note and playing it corre-
sponded to the sound of a different note. The violin was
re-tuned to disrupt the relation between auditory expecta-
tions and performed gesture. A potential outcome of such
a disruption is impaired fluency, a state where it is not pos-
sible to play something at tempo or with proper rhythm or
intonation because it is necessary to pay conscious attention
to each action.
Three different conditions were designed to answer to the
following question: when auditory-imagery and motor pro-
grams are decoupled with a re-tuned instrument, which are
the circumstances that allow faster/more accurate execu-
tions?Each condition was explained to participants be-
forehand. In concert notation musicians played musical ex-
cerpts notated for violin (concert notation). This condition
tested whether inducing players to think of a new connec-
tion between their auditory imagery and their motor pro-
grams to achieve the right sound result in a loss of pitch
accuracy and fluency. In the transposed notation condition
musicians played musical excerpts whose notated pitches
are altered to account for the different tuning of each violin

string. The notation indicates the pitch that would sound
on a normally-tuned violin, but the sounding pitch will be
different. This condition was designed to allow musicians to
ignore the auditory feedback coming from the violin and to
focus on the notation. The condition tested whether par-
ticipants could perform fluently in presence of a notation
that shows the right sensory-motor actions while produc-
ing a unfamiliar auditory feedback. By using notation, we
designed a direct link to the performer’s motor programs
and auditory-imagery to assess if pitch accuracy and flu-
ency improves. In the audio playback condition, musicians
replicated a music passage reproduced by a speaker. This
condition allowed to discriminate the influence of notation
in the previous two sections, and was designed to assess
whether playing by ear on a re-tuned instrument is at least
as hard as by playing with concert notation.
4.3.1 Procedure
In this part of the study, violinists were asked to perform
short musical passages (between two and seven seconds of
duration) on a re-tuned violin. Musicians were asked to
avoid using vibrato in their executions. Music passages
were selected among unknown compositions from the West-
ern baroque music repertoire. Each music passage was per-
formed by participants twice. The intent was to present
short melodies that were familiar to the violinist’s cultural
space but that they would have not seen before. In this
second part, violinists used a re-tuned violin made avail-
able by the researchers. A violin is usually tuned from the
lower string to the upper string as follows: G3, D4, A4, E5.
Starting from the lower string up to the higher string the
violin was tuned in fourths as follows: A3, D4, G4, C5.
Violinists were asked to perform music passages in three
different conditions. In the first condition (concert nota-
tion), eight music passages were notated as they are. In
the second condition (transposed notation) eight music pas-
sages were notated as they sound on the re-tuned violin (the
notation was transposed to match the violin re-tuning). In
the third condition (audio playback), eight melodies were
reproduced through speakers. Notations included instruc-
tions on tempo.
The order of the transposed notation, concert notation
and audio playback sections was randomised for each par-
ticipant. Participants were asked to play only in the first
position. It was critical to have violinists to move be-
tween strings to maximise the disruption produced by the
re-tuning and observe its effects. Each music passage was
presented only once to avoid biases resulting from having
already played a melody in a previous section. Violinists
were asked to perform each melody twice.
The audio coming from the violin was recorded with a
DPA microphone. The software Tony [9] was used to auto-
matically segment players’ recordings for each passage into
notes and provide frequency estimates. Pitch deviation was
computed in three steps. First we identified the closest pitch
on the chromatic scale for each played note (using a custom
algorithm), then we measured the average frequency of the
note (using the monophonic pitch tracking algorithm pYin
[10]), and finally we applied the following formula
pitchDevn = 1200∗ log2(averageFn/expectedFn)
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted to assess the
significance of the comparison between absolute values of
the pitch deviation for concert notation and transposed no-
tation, then for concert notation and audio playback and
finally for transposed notation and audio playback. For this
test, and the following Wilcoxon tests, the resulting p value
and effect size were reported to facilitate the interpretation
of the data.
The length of each execution was divided by the expected
length of the music passage (calculated by converting its no-
tation to an audio file using the software Muse Score [20]).
The resulting ratios highlight the relation between the du-
ration of the performances and the duration of the music
passages.
Wilcoxon signed-rank test [23] was conducted to assess
the significance of the comparison between duration ratios
in the concert notation and in the transposed notation con-
ditions.
The number of notes in the performance recording of each
music passage was compared to the number of notes forming
the melody to estimate the number of extra notes played.
The termextra identifies notes that are extraneous to the
notation to be executed (i.e. repeated notes or wrong notes
performed in the attempt of finding the right finger position
on the re-tuned violin). The resulting data should be taken
as approximate as music passages were segmented using an
automatic music transcription algorithm.
Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to assess the
significance of the comparison between the number of extra
notes in the concert notation and in the transposed notation
conditions.
In the audio section, participants struggled to identify
and repeat music passages. Most of the passages were not
performed entirely, and the duration of the execution was
randomly shorter or longer according to the difficulty of the
passage (which could be quantified in number of notes to
remember, tempo in bpm). Therefore, it was decided to
exclude the audio section from the extra notes and perfor-
mances duration data analysis.
4.3.2 Transposed notation versus concert notation
Performers’ pitch accuracy in the transposed notation con-
dition compared to the concert notation condition presented
a deviation mean of 14.91 vs 17.30 cents with p≈ 0.001.
However, effect size was small at 0.039.
Performances duration was closer to the music passages
duration in the transposed notation condition compared to
the concert notation condition with a mean of 3.69 vs 6.46
seconds, p≈ 1.75E-16, and effect size 0.40.
Executions of transposed notation were characterised by
less extra-notes compared to concert notation. Specifically
49 versus 770 notes with p≈ 1.75E-16, effect size 0.30.

tation condition compared to the audio playback condition
with a pitch deviation mean of 14.91 vs 17.42 cents with p

tion compared to the audio playback condition presented a
deviation mean of 17.03 vs 17.42 cents (p≈ 4.32E-05, small
effect size at effect size 0.05).
5. DISCUSSION
The first part of the study suggests that if a musician does
not have a familiar mental image of the sound that is in-
tended to play, then it does not matter whether the in-
strument is familiar or not. During the study, the violin-
ists were playing an instrument that they know very well.
Nonetheless, they struggled with their pitch accuracy, and
time response in playing quarter tones both in the notation
and audio sections. We propose that quarter tones were not
played as well as semitones as participants lack a coherent
sonic imagination coupled to the needed motor programs.
In the second part of the study, our results suggest that
the transposed notation led to more fluent executions. Mu-
sic passages had a duration and number of notes more co-
herent with the indications presented in the notation com-
pared to both concert notation and audio playback perfor-
mances. It is proposed that transposed notation worked so
well because it let musicians use their familiar auditory im-
agery, which, in turn, is connected to the actions needed
to perform the notation. Even if the resulting sound was
not the one they imagined to be, the fluency of the perfor-
mance improved. In the transposed notation scenario, the
imagery was deliberately incorrect; the notation did not
produce the sounds that it specifies. Nonetheless, it worked
better to use a notation thatspecified the correct motor ac-
tions and that produced a “wrong” but familiar auditory
result (transposed notation) than to have a notationspeci-
fying a “correct” but unfamiliar auditory feedback (concert
notation). Hence, these results suggest that having access
to an existing auditory imagery and motor programs is more
critical than perceiving the correct auditory feedback.
5.1 Implications for instrument design
In this study, we saw that playing quarter tones was a chal-
lenging task even with a traditional violin with no modifica-
tions. In this condition, having the right mapping precision,
and auditory feedback did not support musicians. When the
auditory imagery of a musician struggles to identify a par-
ticular sound event, then the motor program to perform it is
also unavailable. The resulting accuracy of the performance
diminishes (quarter tones and concert notation). When the
auditory feedback is unfamiliar, but musicians can access
their auditory imagery, and its related motor programs,
the accuracy of the performance (in terms of pitch preci-
sion and fluency) is better preserved (transposed notation).
Additional examples that demonstrate these principles are
prepared piano, and MIDI keyboards. A piece for these
instruments can still be notated as a piano piece, and play-
ers will not have troubles when playing it even in presence
of unfamiliar auditory feedback. Possibly because they can
imagine the traditional music space where the keyboard and
the notation sit, and they can play the instrument whatever
sound it produces.
In NIME discussions, there is often-times a focus on the
ability to produce any given sound using mapping strategies
and technological solutions. We propose that a lack of audi-
tory imagery constitutes a mental limitation rather than a
technical constraint in the design process. Hence, the design
lens should shift from a technology-focused view to include
a more human-based perspective to address such a limita-
tion. Taking a technocentric approach could only account
for questions concerning topics like mapping, precision, and
degree of freedom. However, it would be insufficient to only
consider human-based aspects like ergonomics of the inter-
face, and useful feedback (audio, tactile, visual). In this
is paper we proposed a further level of attention, which ac-
counts for the sensory-motor link in music performance, and
the feedforward mechanism that describes it. We propose
this process as an essential element to account for in the
design of an interface that is meant to produce new sounds.
If the kind of performance that is aimed to enable is the
one afforded by a traditional instrument (where musicians
have an embodied relationship with it), then it almost does
not matter what the interface is. If players cannot imagine
the sounds, then they can not play them.
This approach poses a fundamental difference from asking
if an instrument can afford to play microtones, or is the in-
strument ergonomically sensible to the hands of the player.
Including the feedforward process in the design process leads
to the following design question: is there an intrinsic link
between a particular interface that is being designed, and
the existing imagination of performers that will play the
interface plus the execution techniques they already own?
If the answer is no, then the instrument would run in a
fundamental limitation which is mental rather then techno-
logical. If the goal as a designer is to let people play un-
familiar sounds, then this human factor needs to be taken
into account.
6. CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study challenge the notion of playing as
a feedback loop where performers think what they want to
do, they play it, and then they evaluate the result based
on the feedback to correct the performance. This study
suggests that this feedback loop it is not critical for the flu-
ent execution of a performance. Feedback may nonetheless
be needed for correction and refinement (i.e. the ends of
each note in the first part of the study were typically more
in tune than the beginning which we wouldn’t expect to
happen without feedback). Musicians can still play when
the imagery is not entirely aligned to the auditory feedback
(as in the transposed notation condition) as long as their
anticipation leads them to the right motor program. Musi-
cians can potentially substitute unfamiliar imagery if they
can leverage a notation system that it is connected to their

existing auditory imagery.
To support the kind of performance that is guided by au-
ditory imagination (i.e. execution with music scores), there
is a need to translate from the imagery of sound to an ac-
tion that is congruent and appropriate on the instrument. If
musicians do not have that connection (i.e. because the in-
strument is totally unfamiliar), then they will also lack the
skills needed to perform with the instrument or its augmen-
tation. Establishing that connection is a goal that provides
space for more research questions liketo what extent is it
possible to use existing auditory imagery to play unfamiliar
sounds? For which musical aspects other than this approach
would it be valid?
In this study, we focused on pitch and fluency. However,
we could also consider other musical aspects like articula-
tion. Finally, when participants where playing transposed
notation, were they truly completely ignoring their audi-
tory feedback? Which aspects were still taken into account
(spectral envelope, articulation)? These questions consti-
tute material for future research.
As shown with concert notation, while thinking and rea-
soning, the quality of musicians’ performance deteriorated.
Design strategies that assure that performance remain au-
tomatic are needed and could rely on auditory imagery.
