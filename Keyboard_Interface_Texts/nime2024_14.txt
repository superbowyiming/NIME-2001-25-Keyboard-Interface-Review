ABSTRACT
This paper presents the Period Instrument, an interface
for musical expression that requires the input of menstrual
blood in order to be played. Drawing from both experi-
mental musical instrument design and feminist design, the
resulting object exists both as a sound-making device as
well as a vector for challenging normative principles of mu-
sical instrument design. Moreover, the Period Instrument
represents a particular representation and physical embod-
iment of time. We will discuss the design and technological
development of the instrument, focusing primarily on how
designing with and for time constraints can result in new
interfaces for musical expression.

1. INTRODUCTION
The menstrual cycle is a series of hormonal changes occur-
ring in the female reproductive system which cause a variety
of psychosomatic processes as well as creating the possibil-
ity of pregnancy. Menstrual cycles are often described as
cyclical: each cycle lasts about 28 days on average, starting
from the first day of bleeding (the period), and ending when
the next bleeding occurs. However, this temporality is not
exact, and there is no normative way that the body behaves
— in fact, most people have cycles that vary from 21 to 35
days, and many people have irregular menstrual cycles or
vary from cycle to cycle [8]. This cyclical and varying tem-

porality is what has provided the context for the Period
Instrument1.
The Period Instrument is a menstrual musical object — it
is designed to create sound exclusively in response to men-
strual blood. As we will discuss in this paper, menstrual
blood is a bodily material that is associated with a wide va-
riety of cultural and social norms, expectations, and taboos,
as well as functioning as a particular representation and
embodiment of time. The instrument generates a personal
sound experience from the blood, responding to patterns of
dripping and flowing of this fluid.
We describe the design and development of the Period
Instrument, situating it as a musical interface designed with
and for time constraints. In this case, applying the concept
of “menstrual time” to the design of a sound-making device
creates a new space for musical intervention. Exploring this
space reveals a complex network of ideas around intimacy,
sustainability, feminism, and bodily materialism. We offer
to the NIME community the Period Instrument as a case
study for how different forms of time could be integrated
into musical instrument design.
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
2.1 Menstruation in art and design
1We align with intersectional feminist studies that point out
that people of all genders menstruate, for example, women,
non-binary people, or trans men. In addition, not all women
menstruate, for example, due to hormonal contraception,
menopause, or illness.
Although it is associated generally with fertility and repro-
duction, in most Western societies menstrual blood is often
framed as a loss and a waste; a failed attempt at reproduc-
tion, a burden, a gendered fluid that should be concealed
and suppressed [34, 8]. Like many bodily materials, men-
strual blood is abject — part of a person, yet also not part of
them once it leaves the body [27]. This abjection causes feel-
ings of disgust and discomfort, often even for the menstru-
ating person. When witnessing menstrual blood separate
from a body, it appears ‘out of place’, dirty, and potentially
toxic [13].
‘Menstrual art’, which has become more of its own genre
in the past decades, explores these tensions, probing our
associations with this fluid, as well as raising questions of
patriarchal control and surveillance of women’s bodies. The
genre took off in the 1970s with artists like Judy Chicago
and her work “Red Flag” [6], which marks one of the first
depictions of menstruation in Western contemporary art.
Since then, menstrual art has proliferated and extended to
social media and digital spheres, where artists have pushed
back against censorship and dealt with trolls and harass-
ment. Notably, “Casting Off My Womb” by Casey Jenkins
was a 28-day performance where the artist inserted yarn
into her vagina and knit a long piece of textile stained by
her fluids [25]. The project went viral, and Casey faced
numerous threats and online harassment, further exposing
the stigma and misogyny attached to society’s views of men-
struation and women’s bodies. Recently, feminist bioartists
have used menstrual blood as a medium in their work, where
menstrual blood cells are isolated and speculated as possi-
ble sources for lab-grown meat and 3D bioprinting [24], or
where the smells of menstrual blood are synthesized and
collected in an installation for the audience to experience
[28].
In HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and Design, a
growing body of work engages in design projects that aim to
increase curiosity and understanding of intimate menstrual
fluids [4, 3]. Speculative approaches include PeriodShare,
where a menstruating person would share menstrual blood
data on social media in a similar way as other fitness data
(going for a run, workout data) [44], or Biomenstrual, a
project which focused on making biodegradable menstrual
pads, reframing menstrual blood as something nutritious
for soil [43, 2]. Further HCI research has speculated on the
capitalist and normative intentions and issues around men-
strual fluid tracking [17] and pointed out many current risks
in the surveillance of intimate data [29].
2.2 From Time Constraints to Sonic
Cyberfeminism
One of the primary characteristics of menstruation and men-
strual blood is a particular relationship to time. As opposed
to linear standard understandings of time, “menstrual time”
[16], can be seen as a framework that accounts for the plu-
rality of menstrual experiences, and how these ebb and flow
in a non-linear fashion. Menstrual time is cyclical, yet of-
ten not predictable, since there are many variations of cycle
length from person to person, and even within the cycle of
one individual.
The concept of menstrual time can be seen as clashing
with the so-called “cornucopian paradigm” of design [36],
where interfaces and digital infrastructures are designed to
be instant, eternal, and pervasive (among other character-
istics), leading to unsustainable approaches to technology.
Indeed, new musical tools are most often marketed on their
ability to offer more (tracks, effects, storage, etc). As Tara
Rodgers and others have pointed out [38], the language used
for music technology is not accidental, and reflects how it is
embedded within socio-technological hegemonic norms; the
ideal “reproducing” medium is generally considered to be
silent, passive, and invisible - qualities that are clearly coded
as traditionally feminine. Meanwhile, the audio source is
meant to be “punchy”, “clear”, or “strong” - and discussions
of fidelity are generally positioned as the struggle for these
masculine traits to be heard despite the perceived weakness
of the reproductive surface. These terms point towards a
political ecology of music technologies [11], perhaps start-
ing with the use of disembodied human ears gathered from
nameless cadavers to build the first sound recording devices
[14], continuing through to gendered approaches to design
and manufacturing [46] and recently with the application of
deep-sea oil drilling technologies to auto-tuning [42].
The normalisation of cornucopian design has been heav-
ily critiqued from a sustainability perspective [5], with a
number of designers and researchers within the Sustainable
HCI (SHCI) [26, 33, 22] community advocating for a “lim-
its” or constraints-based approach [31] to move towards a
more socially and technologically sustainable future.
The broader fields of Human-Computer Interaction and
media arts have recently seen a number of projects that
take time constraints as a starting point. Tega Brain’s
work Being Radiotropic2, for example, demonstrates a set
of different approaches to powering internet routers, making
their signal strength dependent on moon phases and candle
flames, among other things. Other research has looked at
the potential for designing for “slow time” [32] and embrac-
ing the inherent irreversibility of time [39].
Similarly, the fundamental principle that underpins the
design of the Period Instrument is the concept of designing
for a time constraint. Essentially: what if the design of
an instrument explicitly limits when (and thus, how) it can
be played? This could be seen as running counter to the
design paradigm that guides the development of most new
technologies (musical or otherwise), which generally priori-
tize accessibility, ease of use, and endless options.
From a musical perspective, the Period Instrument can
be seen within the context of a variety of projects that re-
spond to time in non-standard ways. Ellen Fullman’s Long
String Instrument, John Cage’s As Slow As Possible, and
Jem Finer’s Longplayer all expand the time dimension of
musical experience significantly. This project is also re-
lated to previous work that uses the human body or specific
anatomical parts and movements as an interface for gener-
ating or manipulating sound. A number of instruments or
systems have been designed that respond to brain or mus-
cle signals [45, 12] , effectively sonifying or amplifying mea-
surements of real-time bodily activity. Other projects have
looked at the relationship between the human body and the
sound-making interface, through gesture [30] or biosensing
[9]. Artists such as Johannes Bergmark have also used the
body as an instrument by amplifying the sounds of eating,
drinking, and moving through the use of internalized mi-
crophones3. Many feminist artists and musicians have been
particularly drawn to work involving the female body and
the intimate experience as a source for sound. Althea Rao’s
’Vagina Chorus’ is a project that uses the movements of the
pelvic floor and the vagina to create a collective sonic per-
formance4 and Maya Livio’s “Music for Eggs” is a musical
score to be played via an intravaginal speaker designed for

gestating fetuses 5. In these projects, the materiality of the
body is central, entangling bodies and identities with tech-
nologies like sensors, actuators, data, networks and more.
Cyberfeminist scholarship highlights and delves into these
entanglements [41]. Within the NIME community, several
projects have explored ‘sonic cyberfeminism’ [23, 40] and
feminist approaches to embodied knowledge [23], as well
as attempts to address some of the shortcomings of NIME
in terms of inclusiveness and diversity [19]. In particular,
Hayes and Marquez-Borbon’s 2020 NIME paper discusses a
lack of critical engagement with gender, the privileging of
traditional temporalities, and a bias towards quantitative
analysis (among many other things). We feel that the Pe-
riod Instrument works with these concepts by integrating
gender, Research Through Design, and time constraints as
fundamental starting points of the project.

3.1 Method
This project took a Research Through Design (RtD) [48, 18,
37] approach to creating a prototype in response to the con-
cepts described above. As such, the focus was on develop-
5https://mayalivio.com/MUSIC-FOR-EGGS-1
ing a functional musical instrument that responded to men-
strual blood, with the instrument functioning as an artifact
that is then analyzed for what it reveals. We will therefore
provide a detailed description of the design process, mate-
rials, and the resulting build, followed by a discussion of
what it is like to “play” the instrument and what concepts
the final design reveals. Within this framework, the instru-
ment itself, and potentially the experience of playing the
instrument, is the resulting knowledge that is generated by
the process.
Due to the nature of menstrual blood as the main ma-
terial, the process naturally took a first-person experimen-
tation approach, with strong elements of autobiographical
exploration. The project work took place in Sweden in late
2023. The two authors, one with experiences of menstruat-
ing, collaborated on the instrument from the beginning, as
it overlapped with both of their research areas.
3.2 Designing with menstrual blood
In order to design and build The Period Instrument, the
menstruating author conducted an exploration of her own
menstrual blood. She experimented with flushing the blood
through a syringe and a transparent tube, watching the
bubbles of air trapped between the blood, the clumps of
tissue darkening the mix. She experimented with differ-
ent dilutions of water, capturing a repertoire of shades of
red and pink. From these explorations, the authors inves-
tigated how to ‘translate’ or ‘map’ the properties of the
blood into sound. At this point, the decision was made to
use an RGB sensor to control the system, since, as artists
and designers, it was very difficult to identify a sensor sys-
tem for rapidly testing whether a liquid is, in fact, blood.
Even more complicated would be to test whether a blood-
like liquid is specifically menstrual blood: while there are
some chemical and material qualities specific to menstrual
blood, such as viscosity or lack of coagulative cells, there are
no off-the-shelf biosensors that could provide us with that
information. Therefore, the technical trade-off is that the
instrument is not in fact dependent on blood: any colored
liquid would trigger some sound, and any red liquid would
suffice to generate a similar sonic palette to the menstrual
blood.
As we discuss later in the ethical considerations in this pa-
per, there are several constraints when working with biolog-
ical material in a research setting, and particularly within
our institution. Thus, the decision was made to use syn-
thetic blood and handcraft a mixture resembling menstrual
blood as much as possible. Therefore, the menstruating
author’s first-person experiences and close observation and
testing were essential to the project. For the final synthetic
blood mixture, we used water, food coloring, and a mucus-
like substance made from soaking flaxseeds.
The aesthetic qualities of lab-like glassware, transparent
tubes, syringes, and exposed cables have been intention-
ally chosen to address and probe the concerns of toxicity of
menstrual blood and the way that it is commonly treated as
a biohazard within academic environments. We explicitly
challenge this by juxtaposing playful and colorful aesthetics
with the serious and medical forms of the lab equipment.
3.3 Sound design
Granular synthesis was chosen primarily due to the way
that it deals with time, which reflected the themes of the
project as a whole. Granular synthesis is a sound genera-
tion and manipulation technique in which an existing sound
recording is broken down into small individual “grains” of
Figure 3: Testing synthetic blood for consistency and color
sound, which are then played back in rapid succession. This
enables a set of manipulations to the sound which would
otherwise be impossible - a sound can be “frozen” in place,
or played at a different speed without changing the pitch
(or vice versa). The time element of sound thus becomes
something malleable, so the sound of a single drop of blood
can be stretched to reflect the time it will take to fall.
We chose three sound samples to overlay using this tech-
nique - two vocal samples (breathing and speaking) and a
musical sample to create melodic and harmonic shifts. On
each change in blood color the granular settings are ad-
justed, creating an ever-shifting texture combining human
and musical sounds. The two vocal samples that were se-
lected were of a female performer using a close-mic record-
ing technique, capturing the texture of breath and the vocal
chords. The musical sample is a musician improvising jazz
on a Fender Rhodes in their home studio with the windows
open, with birds audibly singing outside.
The selection of these samples (and the mapping of the
color to various granular parameters) can be seen as primar-
ily stemming from artistic choice, with the aim of generat-
ing a satisfying sonic palette that reflects the themes of the
work. Thus, the final result included a balance of sounds
that clearly come from a physical human body together with
musical elements that provide melodic activity.
Three granular parameters are changed each time a shift
in the blood color is detected by the sensor. These are grain
size, grain density (number of times per second a grain is
triggered), and grain offset within the sample. The other
parameters in the granular synthesis system (pitch, offset
randomization, etc) are all fixed at values we determined
to work well for the source material. The entire granular
system is activated only when a color is detected, and the
primary volume control is linked to the red value.
This approach to the sound design provides a balance
between randomness and consistency, in the sense that the
overall sonic texture remains similar and recognizable, whilst
each individual moment will have different characteristics.
This system also results in satisfying moments of texture
and ambiance when the blood is flowing through the tube,
as well as rapid pseudo-melodic changes when the flow is
interrupted by bubbles or variable shades of red. These
Figure 4: Synthetic blood flowing through the RGB sensor
moments were explored in our early tests when we discov-
ered that variations in the shade of red (which naturally
occur in menstrual blood), as well as bubbles (which occur
as a result of using relatively thin tubing), provided the op-
portunity for particularly satisfying musical feedback (see
Figure 4).
3.4 Technical build
The Period Instrument is built on a retort (or “clamp”)
stand originally designed for lab work. A set of arms are at-
tached to the center support, supporting the main interface
elements. Menstrual blood is poured into a glass funnel at
the top, which is connected to a tube with a fluid regulator.
This tube runs through a 3D-printed container containing
an LED and an RGB sensor. The blood flows past the sen-
sor and into a receptacle below. The sensor and light are
attached to a Teensy microcontroller which converts the
color data into MIDI control change messages. The Teensy
is connected via USB to a Bela board. A Pure Data (Pd)
patch is running on the Bela board, responding to the MIDI
messages sent from the Teensy. The audio from the Bela
is connected to speakers mounted on the retort stand. The
entire instrument is thus self-contained. A menstruating
person who uses a menstrual cup can play the instrument
by pouring the contents of their cup into the funnel at the
top.
The 3D-printed enclosure for the RGB sensor was made
primarily to enable consistent readings. By surrounding
the tube with a fairly opaque material and building a light
source inside, the sensor was able to provide data indepen-
dent of the ambient light in the room, lessening the need

typed in clay.
for recalibration. The priority was for the instrument to be
silent when not in use, but to react immediately to blood.
Various shapes were tested (see fig.5) before settling on the
droplet shape, which provided a balance of aesthetic appeal
and functionality.
The data from the RGB sensor was scaled to MIDI, with
the three color values and one transparency value converted
to control change messages ranging from 0-127 and sent out
from the Teensy over USB MIDI. This was determined to
be the best option to allow for prototyping flexibility, so
that the Teensy could be connected to any computer for
rapid testing, and eventually connected also to the Bela for
standalone use. The main downside to this approach was a
relatively low data resolution, but this did not prove to be an
issue due to the specific nature of the design requirements
- the main priority was to detect different shades of red,
while other colors could be effectively ignored.
The data processing and sound generation is accomplished
in Pure Data, using a granular synthesis system developed
by the first author. The patch attempts to judge whether
the current color being detected by the RGB sensor is a
shade of red. If so, a number of settings for three granu-
lar sound generators are randomized within a set range as
described above. With the settings lightly randomized, the
master volume of the sound output is then raised, with the
volume of each individual sound controlled by the relative
ratio of red, green, and blue. The code is all available on
GitHub6, and a video can be viewed on YouTube 7.
4. PLAYING THE INSTRUMENT
The Period Instrument is thus designed to be played by a
menstruating person who uses a menstrual cup. The blood
in the cup is poured into the glass funnel at the top of the in-
strument. Watching the instrument, the “player” naturally
follows the blood dripping down the tube, and anticipates
the sound as the liquid approaches the sensor. The blood
trickles down in an unpredictable pattern, some gaps, some
bubbles, some rapid jumps, some quiet and gentle drops.
The sound reflects this: uneven, skittish, but occasionally

calm. Each bubble, clump, or color change is represented in
the resulting music through a shift in the parameters of the
granular synthesis voices. The most noticeable, perhaps,
is the musical sample, which changes pitch and generates
unique melodies each time it is used. The vocal samples pro-
vide timbre and bring a human texture to the sound, which
is projected at roughly ear-height from the built in speakers
on the instrument. Any uninterrupted flow of blood gen-
erates a static musical texture, the sound frozen in time
until the sensor detects a change. The last dregs of blood
often take some time to drip down the tube, the color value
slowly dropping along with the resulting volume of sound,
until the instrument returns to silence. The player finishes
by pouring water into the funnel to clean the system, re-
sulting in one last moment of sound. The blood and water
in the receptacle can now be taken away for cleaning.
5. DISCUSSION
5.1 Temporality and Constraints
We deliberately chose to use musical sound as a method for
exploring and reinforcing the concept of menstrual time,
because sound is perhaps the form of media most linked to
time. The act of listening is dependent on surrendering our
time to a sound - we cannot simply listen quickly to a sound
in the same way that we can glance at a photograph. This
leads to Chion’s ideas of sound as the prime conveyor of
time in the audio-visual experience, effectively arguing that
not only does sound rely on time to convey information, but
also vice versa [7].
Time is therefore something of a design material with this
project, both in terms of the menstrual time aspect as well
as the use of sound. In particular, time is the main design
constraint. The instrument can only be used, after all, by
someone who is menstruating, at the time of menstruation,
and even then only practically during heavier bleeding days.
The instrument is silent for the rest of the time, and if
you miss your opportunity, you cannot use it until the next
cycle.
By working with the constraints of menstrual time, rather
than against them, this artwork suggests that the periods
of time when the instrument is silent are equally impor-
tant. This instrument performs, through silence punctu-
ated by occasional moments of music, the sound of men-
strual time. We align with Max Picard’s philosophical no-
tion of silence as more than merely the opposite of sound,
but rather “a complete world in itself” [35]. Picard’s defi-
nition is extended into how silence’s apparent “uselessness”
also presents a challenge to a society (or indeed, a music
technology sector) that desires profit and utility. The use
of silence in the Period Instrument eschews the cornucopian
approach to technological design in favor of an embrace of
limits and the resulting silence.
Playing the instrument can be seen as a sonic manifesta-
tion of a human cycle, one which operates on its own (often
frustrating) time. This is, of course, a constraint - however,
arguably, the resulting instrument may not necessarily be
played significantly less than an average musical instrument,
which spends the vast majority of its life not being played.
The default position of any musical instrument is, after all,
silence. Thus, the constraint of operating on menstrual time
is perhaps not as extreme as it may seem, but rather, the
Period Instrument could potentially occupy a similar con-
ceptual place as a piano, which in many households takes
up space but is rarely played.
One of the motivations for a constraints-based design ap-
proach to this project was how it could align with contem-
porary thinking on Sustainable HCI (SHCI), particularly by
employing an anti-cornucopian design stance. The Period
Instrument shows, perhaps, the potential that new musical
interfaces have to explore the SHCI design space. Whilst
admittedly the majority of commercial music technology de-
signs fall squarely within the cornucopian mindset, experi-
mental interfaces such as the Period Instrument can reject
some core assumptions of many musical technologies - that
they should be endless and instantly available. What if we
limited our ability to hear a sound or create a musical inter-
action? If a musical experience is no longer accessible at any
given moment, perhaps it goes some way towards challeng-
ing the norms of listening and experiencing sound. This
therefore positions our use of time as a constraint within
sustainability-led design.
5.2 Menstrual blood, materiality, and
political ecologies
Whilst this paper has focused on the time-constraints aspect
of the design of the instrument, the very act of menstruating
is also quite clearly a major design factor - who can ’play’
the musical instrument (and how) is also a constraint. In
order to play, the user/menstruating person must collect
their blood via a menstrual cup, which is one method of
menstrual care, but not the most common. The menstrual
blood might be directly poured into the top funnel of the
instrument, or via a portable container or vial, since re-
moving and changing a menstrual cup is often done in the
bathroom. This opens questions on the context and loca-
tion of the instrument, which we imagine creates different
uses and social implications. For instance, if the instrument
exists in a public space, it might be shared, raising issues of
cleanliness, hygiene, and taboos. In terms of presentation,
questions arise on who can perform and play the instrument,
and a performance would presumably have to be ’scheduled’
according to one’s menstrual cycle. As an RtD project, we
intentionally leave these questions open, and use the arti-
fact as a way to discuss and provoke conversations around
temporality, stigmas, and ethical tensions associated with
menstrual blood.
These ethical tensions have been pointed out by previ-
ous design projects using bodily fluids, such as breast milk,
urine or other vaginal fluids, which become especially prob-
lematic when doing autobiographical work, or using your
own biological material throughout the design process [3,
20, 21, 47]. Designing with bodily fluids is a challeng-
ing space, where ethical constraints are imposed by insti-
tutional limitations, as well as social norms and the ’ac-
ceptability’ of using bodily materials in the research lab.
Menstrual blood is, in a way, a mundane and everyday part
of many people’s lives, yet when it enters the research envi-
ronment, it becomes a potentially ’toxic’ research material,
subject to procedural ethics including processes such as get-
ting permission from an ethical review board and figuring
out biosafety regulations. Although essential for reducing
and preventing harm within research projects, these regula-
tions do not take into account the use of first-person meth-
ods, especially when the interest might not be in studying
the chemical and biological properties of the bodily fluid,
but in the first-person experiences and accounts of design-
ing with these materials [21].
Furthermore, when designing with bodily fluids, tradi-
tional methods of rapid prototyping are challenging, since
you cannot just “get blood”, test a design, and quickly iter-
ate. There is a very direct constraint not only when playing
the instrument, but also when designing: menstrual blood
was only available (through the experiences of the menstru-
ating author) once every 30 days or so. And even then, it
is not simple to ‘collect’ it anywhere, nor can it be easily
stored, especially within the research lab. The menstruating
author performed all her observations and experiments with
her blood at home, and the decision was made to sidestep
this complex web of ethics and to use synthetic blood as a
symbolic replacement for menstrual blood. In making this
decision, we ask what might be lost when replacing men-
strual blood for synthetic blood, and does it matter? Is the
instrument still challenging the stigma of menstrual blood
when using synthetic blood? Perhaps the use of real blood
is not as important as the symbolism of the instrument it-
self. We also see the Period Instrument as a way to reframe
menstrual blood, as a ’fuel’ for the machine, as something
useful and valuable, rather than a waste, thus using the
artifact as a catalyst for critical discussions on bodies and
taboos in general.
We openly acknowledge that our design allows for the
instrument to be used in ways we do not desire or expect:
any fluid could be poured into the funnel to generate sound,
and any red liquid would closely mimic the effect of men-
strual blood. From a political ecology standpoint, the lack
of sensing technologies for measuring menstrual blood could
be seen as illustrative of the general lack of female-centric
technological development. More abstractly, a parallel can
be made to the development of historically-informed period
instruments, which will necessarily contain compromises in
terms of materials, processes, and final implementation. A
historical lute maker can not guarantee that a performer
will not play the instrument in front of a microphone for
an audience in an air-conditioned concert hall with mod-
ern lighting. An instrument designer must accept that the
framework and principles that guided the design may not
be respected by the end user.
This historical example is not accidental. When first
discussing the concept of a menstrual blood-responsive in-
Figure 7: Google Image result from a search for “menstrual
musical instrument”
strument, we googled the phrase “menstrual musical instru-
ment”. We were somewhat surprised to see results primarily
showing lutes and harpsichords - clearly the search engine
had internally converted the term “menstrual” to “period”,
resulting in a set of search results reflecting so-called ‘period
instruments’ (see fig. 7). We were struck by the underlying
assumptions in the language processing of the search tech-
nology, which reflects decades of embedded male dominance
(or at least female invisibility) in the development of those
tools. Thus, the title of our instrument is a play on words
with the concept of period instruments, in which musical
instruments are designed, built, and played with the inten-
tion of recreating every aspect of a musical performance
from a chosen era in the past. It is also simultaneously a
reference to the biased assumptions made by technologies
on our behalf.
6. CONCLUSION
The Period Instrument as a musical device shows how an
alternative conception of time can be applied to the creation
of sonic interfaces. Using a constraints-led approach, time
can become a method for finding new places for musical
interventions. In our particular case, selecting menstrual
time as a constraint meant exploring the potential for de-
signing an instrument for a hitherto musically unexplored
and ultra-personal moment. This approach opened a num-
ber of questions about how a musical instrument can repre-
sent concepts of sustainability, the stigma and materiality
of menstrual blood, and feminist design in general.
While we concentrated our efforts on menstrual time, we
invite other musical instrument designers to take a similar
approach to any number of other conceptions of time - some
composers have already explored non-human approaches to
time [10], for example, and design theory has begun to en-
gage with notions of crip time [15] and even questioning
how clocks orient our particular worldview and represent a
generally incomplete picture of the realities of time [1]. The
Period Instrument, as a tangible prototype, argues that by
engaging with time and designingfor constraints, new areas
of musical expression can be unlocked.

Ethics Statement
This research paper describes the design and fabrication of
a musical instrument that uses menstrual blood to generate
sound. The artifact thus opens up for discussions on inti-
macy, bodies, temporalities, and gender. The first ethical
concern, discussed in the paper itself, is the use of men-
strual blood in the design of the instrument. Menstrual
blood is a biological material that can contain blood-borne
diseases such as sexually-transmitted diseases, thus in med-
ical/clinical research it is treated as a biohazard and often
subject to storage regulations in order to avoid the risk of
infecting other researchers if diseases were present. Addi-
tionally, menstrual blood is highly stigmatized, perceived as
disgusting, which adds to this association of toxicity. Our
design intentionally wants to challenge these associations,
bringing menstrual blood to the center of a musical arti-
fact. However, given the restrictions of our institution (a
technical university) and the ethical guidelines of our coun-
try (Sweden), we did not bring collected menstrual blood
into the lab or makerspace. Instead, the menstruating au-
thor used her own first-person experiences throughout the
process by experimenting in the privacy of her home. In
her home, she observed her own menstrual blood, gathering
aesthetic inspiration and also noticing the qualities of the
texture and composition of the blood in order to replicate it
by making a synthetic mixture. The synthetic mixture was
used to test and iterate on the instrument’s design and to
film the documentation. When writing “no menstrual blood
was brought into the lab space”, we also want to point out
the blurriness of this, as of course, menstruating bodies are
often in the lab, and might they always carry a potential
to ‘intoxicate’ if say, they leak? With this we also reflect in
the paper how there are no clear guidelines on how to work
with bodily fluids like menstrual blood in design research—
we are not doing clinical studies on the menstrual blood,
but rather using it for it’s aesthetic and stigmatized mean-
ings. Finally, we would like to point out how this research
was led by two PhD students, and we are therefore influ-
enced and affected by the advice given by our advisors. For
this project, the advisors were not involved in the design
process, which is especially important for the menstruat-
ing author to be able to state that she was not coerced nor
forced to do research with her own body and her own men-
strual experiences, but rather this came from her own will
and curiosity.
