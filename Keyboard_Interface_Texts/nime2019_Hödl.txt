ABSTRACT
With a new digital music instrument (DMI), the interface it-
self, the sound generation, the composition, and the perfor-
mance are often closely related and even intrinsically linked
with each other. Similarly, the instrument designer, com-
poser, and performer are often the same person. The Aca-
demic Festival Overtureis a new piece of music for the DMI
Trombosonic and symphonic orchestra written by a com-
poser who had no prior experience with the instrument.
The piece underwent the phases of a composition compe-
tition, rehearsals, a music video production, and a public
live performance. This whole process was evaluated reﬂect-
ing on the experience of three involved key stakeholder: the
composer, the conductor, and the instrument designer as
performer. ‘Blending dimensions’ of these stakeholder and
decoupling the composition from the instrument designer
inspired the newly involved composer to completely rethink
the DMI’s interaction and sound concept. Thus, to deliber-
ately avoid an early collaboration between a DMI designer
and a composer bears the potential for new inspiration and
at the same time the challenge to seek such a collaboration
in the need of clarifying possible misunderstandings and im-
provement.

1. INTRODUCTION
With new digital music instruments (DMI), their design
often overlaps with composition and performance [10]. In
many cases designer, composer, and performer are united in
one person [17, 1, 12]. In some other cases, DMI designers
give their instruments to composers to study unconsidered
issues [11]. Open questions include whether the DMI or an
artistic concept comes ﬁrst [12] or if even a growing reper-
toire can drive creativity [5].
This article contributes to the ongoing debate around
the designer-composer-performer tension. The case study,

which is presented, decouples a DMI from its designer and
the composition forblending dimensions. This intention was
embedded in a process covering the composition, a record-
ing and music video production, and a public live perfor-
mance. The DMI Trombosonic used for this study already
featured in a series of performances and evaluations [7]. The
designer of the Trombosonic initiated this project together
with a symphonic orchestra, the TU Orchester.1
The whole music production process was evaluated by
reﬂecting on the experience of three key stakeholder per-
spectives: the composer, the performer, and the conduc-
tor. This reﬂection concerns unplanned and unforeseeable
changes throughout the production process, their causes,
and how they were handled. Furthermore, we report on the
mutual impact concerning the DMI and artistic considera-
tions behind the composition and the performance. Finally,
we discuss our ﬁndings against the backdrop of the state of
the art in the designer-composer-performer relationship.
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
When working with new DMIs, activities such as designing,
composing and performing are often uniﬁed in one person
[17, 1, 12]. According to a survey from 2018, 78% of the
sample population designed the DMI that they play and
97% of the surveyed performer have been involved in the
instrument design [12].
To compose or perform is diﬀerent as with well-known
and established instruments such as a piano, for instance.
If you write a piece for piano as a composer you most likely
know exactly how a piano works, sounds, and can be played.
Many composers did so throughout hundreds of years. With
new DMIs, however, their complexity can be overwhelming
compared to established instruments [13]. On the contrary,
simplicity in DMI design can reduce or avoid this complexity
and at the same time encourage creativity [18]. New DMIs
have also been given to composers other than the designers
on purpose to oﬀer the instrument to a wider community
and get feedback to reﬁne the instrument’s design [11].
Nevertheless, musical pieces are often linked to the DMI
and a speciﬁc concept or a speciﬁc mapping, which is often
considered essential for the instrument [8]. Also the com-
poser often “doubles as the performer-engineer” [1] (p.101).
Only some cases, such as the Reactable [9], show that DMIs
can become popular, be sustainable, and are used by other
composers and performers than their inventors.
The sustainability of a DMI and the reproduction of a mu-
sical piece is being discussed along with matters of design
and evaluation. Ferguson and Wanderley [4] propose the
“ability to reproduce a performance of a particular piece”
(p.32) as one eﬀective measure to evaluate DMIs. Simi-

larly, Butler [2] strengthens the need for pedagogical etudes
to learn performance techniques as evaluation for DMIs.
O’Modhrain [14] presents a framework for the evaluation
of DMIs. Besides the designer, composer, and performer,
he also considers the audience and the manufacturer and
their viewpoint on DMIs. A diﬀerent approach is presented
by Snyder [16]. He did not actually evaluate his new DMI
but rather continuously developed it and reports on design
problems, creative inspirations, and unplanned discoveries.
3. RESEARCH APPROACH
Methodologically, this work relies on two sorts of qualita-
tive data and its reﬂection. Firstly, data collection hap-
pened from the initial idea and start of the project until
the ﬁnal production and live performances. Everything was
documented accompanying each step for more than a year
in a protocolar way. The summary of these continuously
extended reports is presented in chapter 5.
Secondly, we draw on the experience of three key stake-
holder within this project as summarized in chapter 6. Two
of them, the composer and the conductor, were interviewed
after the whole production ended. They were asked ques-
tions about their experience with the whole process, the
composition, and the DMI Trombosonic.
The performer of the Trombosonic as the third key stake-
holder had a special role. He, as the designer of the DMI,
accompanied the project scientiﬁcally from the beginning
and authored this publication. His experience is taken into
account as well as it is an integral element representing
both, studying and doing the performance [15]. The per-
former recorded his experience as diary notes throughout
the project and analysed it in an auto-ethnographic man-
ner [3].
4. THE DMI AND THE COMPOSITION
The DMI Trombosonicand the musical result, theAcademic
Festival Overture, as both described next, are not part of
the actual data body and focus of this research. But they
both form the framework for this study.
4.1 The Trombosonic
This digital music instrument is inspired by the slide trom-
bone. It is played by using arms, ﬁngers, and mouth in
various embodied ways due to its compact, wireless, and
sensor-based design. The main control interfaces are an
ultrasonic sensor as imaginary trombone slide, a thermal
resistor as mouth piece, and a gyroscope to use the instru-
ment’s movement for sound modulation. See Figure 1 to
get an impression of the instrument. A full description con-
cerning the conceptual, technical, and musical background
is available in [6].
The Trombosonic featured in around a dozen public per-
formances. All performances were played by the designer,
mostly solo, and all musical pieces for the DMI were com-
posed by himself for the instrument so far. These pieces
include electro-acoustic compositions as well as popular mu-
sic. Furthermore, the Trombosonic was evaluated for uses
beyond its primary purpose as musical instrument. This
evaluation focused on children and adults of diﬀerent ages
without prior knowledge about the DMI and their experi-
ence when using the instrument as well as the opinion of an
audience at a live performance [7].
4.2 The Academic Festival Overture
This musical piece, the Academic Festival Overture2, is a
composition for classical symphony orchestra and the DMI
2The original German title is “Akademische Festouvert¨ure”
Figure 1: The Trombosonic
Trombosonic. The whole music piece is based on Johannes
Brahms’s Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 68, and in par-
ticular the ﬁrst nine measures or approximately 30 seconds.
A music video of the full piece is available online. 3
The orchestra uses normal scores and plays variations of
these ﬁrst eight measures of the original scores of Brahms.
(see Figure 2, left) The orchestra instrumentation is written
for 2 ﬂutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 contrabas-
soons, 2 horns on C, 2 horns on Eb, 2 trumpets, 3 timpani
in B C Db, 8 ﬁrst violins, 8 second violins, 6 violas, 4 cellos
and 4 basses.
The solo part, played by the Trombosonic, is more com-
plex and is notated in two ways: musical scores (see Figure
2, right) and a textual explanation for the concept. The
Trombosonic uses a 30 second playback of Brahms’s Sym-
phony No. 1 manually controlled by a start and stop button
on the instrument. For sound generation, the Trombosonic
uses an externally ampliﬁed Max/MSP-based synthesizer.
During the ﬁrst half of the piece, see letter A in Figure
2 (right), the Trombosonic loops just the ﬁrst eight note of
the playback which creates a staccato-like sound. At letter
B, the Trombosonic uses the playback as it is, but starts
and stops it according to the scores.
The volume control of the playback works with the ﬁgu-
rative trombone-slide or in fact the ultrasonic sensor on the
front side. The left hand is used to increase and decrease
the volume according to the respective musical symbols in
the scores. The upper mordent ornaments in the scores in-
dicate an amplitude modulation for the original recording
given as formula in the textual explanation. This amplitude
modulation is applied dynamically with the mouth piece,
a thermal resistor. Turning the instrument clockwise or
counter-clockwise transposes the playback up or down by a
half tone.
5. THE PRODUCTION PROCESS
The following chapter describes the process from the com-
position competition with the Academic Festival Overture
as winning piece, through rehearsals, to the music video
production and live performances.
5.1 Composition competition
The competition was announced by the TU Orchester as
composition for classical symphony orchestra and the digital
music instrument Trombosonic. The given criteria for the
piece were approximately ﬁve minutes duration submitted
as scores plus a music demo. For the orchestra a classical

Figure 2: Scores of theAcademic Festival Overture: First page of the orchestra score, all instruments (left),
full score for the Trombosonic (right)
score notation was required with minimum and maximum
shorthand for the instrumentation. The scores for the solo
part were allowed to be graphical as well. The winner of
this competition was awarded 2.000 Euro and at least two
public performances of the piece within the year after the
competition.
Composers were not required to have any prior experience
with the Trombosonic or DMIs in general. To support com-
posers regarding the Trombosonic, a website was provided
with a written description of its functionality including pic-
tures [6], two videos of the instrument (a demo 4 and a per-
formance5), and the oﬀer to contact the designer by e-mail
for questions. Furthermore, a public workshop at the Uni-
versity of Music and Performing Arts Viennawas held for
all interested composers to demonstrate the Trombosonic
to them, show its possibilities, and answer their questions
regarding the instrument. A second optional workshop was
announced as well, but no composer demanded it.
Finally, three complete submissions were registered and
handed over anonymised to a jury to select the winning
piece. The ﬁve jury members were the conductor, the per-
former, a representative of the orchestra, and two professors
for composition. The evaluation criteria for the jury were
the novelty of the overall concept, the playability for orches-
tra and Trombosonic, and the aesthetic quality.
5.2 Rehearsals and production
Two full rehearsals of the orchestra and the Trombosonic
were scheduled apart from individual rehearsals of orchestra
sections and the Trombosonic soloist. The ﬁrst full rehearsal
was intended to get an impression of the piece played live

Figure 3: The recording setting in theKuppelsaal
by orchestra and Trombosonic together. The second full
rehearsal happened the day before the audio recording and
music video production. The second full rehearsal and the
production took place in the Kuppelsaal of the Vienna Uni-
versity of Technology. See Figure 3 for an impression of the
production setting. The white table in the front hosts the
laptop with the Trombosonic Max/MSP synthesizer, the DI
boxes for recording, and a headphone ampliﬁer for the con-
ductor and the soloist.
The audio recording of the ﬁve minute piece was split in
three steps throughout a whole day. First, the orchestra
recorded 30 seconds of the original beginning of Brahms’s
Symphony No. 1 to be later used as playback for the Trom-
bosonic’s sampler. This was a normal recording situation
for the orchestra and the conductor without the DMI at all.
Right after the playback was recorded, the audio engineers
200
mixed and mastered the orchestra recording as it was used
immediately in step two as playback for the Trombosonic.
In the second step, the orchestra and the Trombosonic
recorded the piece together. For this step, the orchestra
was recorded acoustically with microphones as usual in such
a setting. The Trombosonic’s synthesizer, however, was
plugged in directly without using a speaker to not interfere
with the natural orchestra sound. Only the soloist and the
conductor could hear the Trombosonic using headphones.
The third step was the video recording. Again, the audio
engineers quickly cut and mixed the music recording of the
whole piece to use it as playback for the video production.
During several takes with static and mobile cameras the
orchestra played live in parallel to the mixed recording while
the DMI played playback only during the video recording.
The whole music and video recording took around 10 hours
without post production, which happened afterwards in an
external studio.
5.3 Release and live concerts
The public release of the Academic Festival Overture pro-
duction was at the oﬃcial ceremony of the 250 years an-
niversary of the Vienna University of Technology. The ﬁrst
live performance of the piece happened two months later
when it was played as part of the regular concert series of
the orchestra. The concert took place in the same hall as the
recording. But instead of the white table with the record-
ing equipment (see Figure 3) two special full frequency range
speakers were used. They were located near the soloist with
the Trombosonic for an optimal sound experience within the
orchestra setting.
6. STAKEHOLDER EXPERIENCES
Three key stakeholder of the production around the Aca-
demic Festival Overture were the composer, the orchestra’s
conductor, and the designer and soloist of the Trombosonic.
They are all experts within their professional domain con-
cerning composing, conducting or working and performing
with DMIs.
None of these stakeholders participated in such a project
setting before and all found themselves in a new situation.
For the composer this was not explicitly intended as it could
have been someone else winning the competition. But the
composer never wrote for a new DMI before apart from
using software for his electro-acoustic compositions. The
conductor was experienced with contemporary music but
had no prior experience with DMIs or electronic instruments
within an orchestra so far. The designer of the Trombosonic
was the only composer for it so far.
6.1 Composer’s perspective
The composer had no particular idea for a composition after
reading the call for the competition and the description of
the Trombosonic. He just thought a precise control of the
instrument’s sound could be limited or problematic from
what he saw in the provided videos. From a conceptual
point of view, he found that it will be important for the
audience to understand how the Trombosonic works and
how its gestural way of playing can be compared to tradi-
tional and familiar instruments. His conclusion was, that
he needs an idea that is “easily to realise” with the DMI,
but of course “musically meaningful,” and at the same time
understandable for the audience.
The actual idea for the piece came right after the work-
shop with the demo of the Trombosonic. The composer
said, on his way home in the tramway, he suddenly had a
clear idea for the concept and the music. He decided to use
pre-recorded samples for sound generation as source for his
own piece and in particular Johannes Brahms’ Symphony
No. 1, op. 6. His reason for this decision was that, from a
pragmatic point of view, there was simply not enough time
to learn about the full capabilities of the Trombosonic or
to work closely together with its designer. From a musical
point of view, by using a sample he could avoid any poten-
tial harmonic problems caused by a DMI he is little familiar
with. Brahms’s Symphony No. 1 worked well for this pur-
pose because it stays on one tone and harmony for the whole
intro. Finally, the composer thought that with samples and
sound modulation he could create a musical demo for the
contest that sounds more realistic and pleasing compared
to a demo song produced with a music notation software.
Concerning the Trombosonic as a new DMI he liked the
way how it shows explicitly its sound control possibilities
and the “Star Trek look,” as he called it. He disliked that
some sensors were too unprecise. Especially during the ﬁrst
rehearsal with the orchestra he was afraid that everything
works as intended.
6.2 Conductor’s perspective
The conductor had no prior experience with digital music
instruments apart from keyboards and a performance he
conducted once with an ampliﬁed celesta. The whole tech-
nical principle of gestural and sensor-based music control
was new to him. The ﬁrst time he saw the Trombosonic
was in a video provided with the competition announce-
ment. Although a DMI and this technical approach to music
was completely new to him, he was excited and motivated
from the beginning and curios how the submitting com-
posers would make use of the Trombosonic’s capabilities.
Overall, he liked the idea that the orchestra will not only
play new music, but a piece that needs a whole concept for
a new music instrument and orchestral music.
Musically, he found the piece a good idea concerning the
concept and its clever arrangement. It was technically not
too demanding for the orchestra which allowed them to play
it well within the capabilities of a non-professional orches-
tra. The “musical mixture with Brahms” was a good choice
as well in this regard as it is a “symphonic reference for
many which helped the player and listener to understand
the piece,” as he said.
The only real diﬃculty for him was the timing with the
Trombosonic and to synchronise with the playback triggered
by the DMI. That was completely new to him during the
ﬁrst rehearsal. Especially the timpani, which had an im-
portant part in the piece, were hard to play accurately in
time with the DMI and he as a conductor had not much
control of this. He could do nothing about the sampling
speed of the Trombosonic but adapt to it which is unusual
for a conductor.
At the same time, he liked the fact that the sample loops
are triggered manually and are under full control of the per-
former. As it is with any other instrument, the manual ges-
tures of the Trombosonic are essential. When the performer
turns the Trombosonic slightly in a diﬀerent angle, it sounds
diﬀerent and you actually hear this expression in realtime
and live. Concerning the recording session, the conductor
reported that it was new to him to use headphones and to
concentrate on the click track.
Overall, for the conductor considered the Trombosonic
a versatile instrument with a lot of capabilities thinking
of the mouthpiece or the gestural control which could be
used quite diﬀerently. He saw the role of the orchestra in
the case of the Academic Festival Overture as one part of
three. There was the recording which was used for sampling,
then there was the performer with the Trombosonic, and
ﬁnally the orchestra completed this sound symbiosis which
201
was something special for everybody involved.
6.3 Performer’s perspective
The most interesting part for the performer in his double
role as the instrument designer was during the competition
and to see how someone else composes for the Trombosonic.
As the designer of the Trombosonic he knows quite well
what is possible or what can be possible with the instrument
and what is more or less impossible.
One submitted but not selected piece, for instance, would
not have been working as it used harmonics in a ways which
would have been impossible to control. The result of the
winning piece, however, was a complete new concept the
composer created for the Trombosonic the designer himself
never thought of. It was fascinating to see how the DMI
inspired the composer to reuse a classical masterpiece in a
modern sound approach to create contemporary music.
The scores of the winning piece were the only problem
the soloist encountered during the selection process of the
competition. Some notations within the scores were hard
to understand or interpret without the composer’s further
explanation (see Figure 2). Some marks were deviating from
standard score notation. Furthermore, due the new concept
of using samples, it was necessary to revise and extend the
capabilities of the Trombosonic’s software synthesizer.
The rehearsals were the most important and demanding
part for the performer as he ﬁnally transitioned from the
designer to become the actual soloist. Before doing any re-
hearsing with the orchestra it took a couple of weeks for the
soloist and phone calls with the composer to understand
the score, to interpret the composer’s musical intentions,
and to rehearse continuously with the music demo of the
orchestral part the composer provided. Nevertheless, the
ﬁrst rehearsal with the orchestra did not go well. The or-
chestra and the performer experienced a complete new sit-
uation performing together. Most of all the composer was
not satisﬁed with the timing and accuracy of the performer
concerning the interplay with the orchestra.
Soon after the ﬁrst rehearsal with the orchestra, two ex-
tra rehearsals between the performer and the composer fol-
lowed. Reasons for these extra rehearsals were misinter-
pretations on the performer’s side of how to play the solo
part and the need to discuss the whole piece in detail. Fur-
thermore, it was necessary to tweak the sound generation
in the synthesizer together with the composer (i.e. sample
playback duration and amplitude modulation) and ﬁnally
rehearse the piece under his guidance. For the performer,
the two rehearsals with the composer and additional single
rehearsals with the music demo over the course of weeks
took around 20 hours.
After these intermediate rehearsals the second rehearsal
with the orchestra worked well without any problems and
only small adjustments regarding the amplitude modulation
of the synthesizer. The recording went smoothly as well
from the performer’s perspective.
7. DISCUSSION
For discussion we reﬂect on the whole process and the stake-
holder experiences. The most notable and at the same time
rather unusual deliberate choice in the production process,
was the composition competition. Right at the beginning
it had an immediate implication for the composer and the
composition as the composer and the designer could not
collaborate directly.
The composer had no particular idea for the composi-
tion when reading the description of the Trombosonic. He
rather assumed certain technical limitations and the reli-
ability (i.e. sensor accuracy) he would have to consider
for the composition, exactly according to O’Modhrain [14].
Furthermore, he claimed the use of the DMI to be under-
standable by the audience. At this point, the composer
acted rather analytical than having an actual creative idea.
This changed immediately after the workshop when he ﬁrst
saw the Trombosonic in real. This had an inspirational im-
pact and the DMI itself inspired the composer. Moreover,
the competition process and not letting the designer and
the composer collaborate for the composition, led to a new
mapping concept for the Trombosonic. This new concept
for the Trombosonic was not considered by the designer so
far and emerged more or less accidentally due to the cir-
cumstances of the competition process. Here we can see
parallels to both, McPherson and Kim [11] and Snyder [16].
As with Murray-Browne [13], the instrument became part
of the composition and directly inspired the composer. But
in the case of the Academic Festival Overture the “lack of
transparency”(p.56) aﬀected the composer at an early stage
instead of the audience during a performance.
Preventing the designer and the composer to collabo-
rate, had another implication apart from a new concept
for the Trombosonic. When the musical piece was written
- and in our case submitted and selected during the com-
petition - the composer’s work was actually done and the
scores handed over for rehearsing. Only the ﬁrst full re-
hearsal revealed deﬁciencies between the original intentions
of the composer and the actual realisation by the DMI de-
signer as performer. The need for collaboration between the
composer and the designer became apparent and concerned
technical improvement as well as performing issues.
The need for technical improvement can be seen as late
consequence of the missing collaboration during the com-
position process. Such improvements after initial perfor-
mances (or rehearsals) are not surprising with DMIs and
sometimes even wanted by such collaborations [11, 16]. In
our case, however, the implications were additional indi-
vidual rehearsals between the composer and the performer
as well as very late adaptations of the synthesizer during
recording.
Regarding the performing issues, in principle, the per-
former was able to reproduce a performance (or rather pro-
duce it in our case) based on the provided score. This
ability to reproduce indicates the quality of the DMI [4]
and in turn also the quality of the piece to be performed
with the DMI. The need for further, unplanned rehears-
ing even demonstrates that the Academic Festival Overture
may serve as a piece to learn (new) performance techniques
[2], especially for the Trombosonic. The piece might even be
inspirational itself to inspire new DMIs [5]. The sampling
technique used for the Academic Festival Overture could
eventually be adopted for a diﬀerent new or existing DMI.
The conductor did not feel much aﬀected or challenged
throughout this project although he saw himself in a new
situation. Most interesting in this regard is, that he consid-
ered the orchestra as one part of three beside the sample of
the orchestra and the DMI that plays the sample. The only
challenge he mentioned was during the ﬁrst full rehearsal
with the DMI when he faced a complete new situation with
the ﬁxed timing of the sample the DMI used.
8. CONCLUSION
We changed the situation and viewpoints of three key stake-
holder in a contemporary music production with a DMI and
symphonic orchestra: the composer of a new music piece,
the conductor of the orchestra, and the performer as soloist
with a DMI. Blending dimensions within this context re-
sulted in a new interaction and sound concept for the in-
202
volved DMITrombosonicand the new music pieceAcademic
Festival Overture.
We contribute to the ongoing discussion of the designer-
composer-performer tension in the context of new DMIs.
Our case study conﬁrms the potential of inspiration and
ﬁnding new concepts for DMIs when letting a composer
write a piece for a DMI he did not know before. Reducing
or even avoiding the collaboration between the designer and
the composer to a minimum during the composition process
might be fruitful forinspiration to ﬁnd novel ideas for a DMI
such as a new mapping concept.
At the same time there is a need for collaboration between
the composer and the performer at certain points when it
comes to a misunderstanding of score notation, performance
aspects, or sound attributes. This suggests the challenge
not to completely avoid collaboration between designer and
composer for the sake of novelty, but to establish and foster
this collaboration speciﬁcally at some points during rehears-
ing.
As a next step, a diﬀerent performer than the instrument
designer could be included in such a setting to gain further
insights in the designer-composer-performer relationship.
