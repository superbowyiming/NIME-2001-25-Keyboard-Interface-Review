ABSTRACT
This paper presents the Sibilim, a low-cost musical interface
composed of a resonance box made of cardboard containing
customised push buttons that interact with a smartphone
through its video camera. Each button can be mapped to
a set of MIDI notes or control parameters. The sound is
generated through synthesis or sample playback and can be
amplied with the help of a transducer, which excites the
resonance box. An essential contribution of this interface is
the possibility of reconguration of the buttons layout with-
out the need to hard rewire the system since it uses only the
smartphone built-in camera. This features allow for quick
instrument customisation for diﬀerent use cases, such as low
cost projects for schools or instrument building workshops.
Our case study used the Sibilim for music education, where
it was designed to develop the conscious of music percep-
tion and to stimulate creativity through exercises of short
tonal musical compositions. We conducted a study with a
group of twelve participants in an experimental workshop
to verify its validity.

lished desktop software (e.g. GarageBand 1 and other digital
audio workstations), and emulations of hardware equipment
(such as Korg's iMS-20 2). In addition to emulating existing
concepts, mobile computing has enabled a distinctive range
of musical interactions that take advantage of the character-
istic features of mobile devices, such as multi-touch screens
and accelerometers. A notable example is \Ocarina" [13]
in which the gesture vocabulary of ute-like instruments is
reinterpreted by allowing the user to play the mobile device
as if it was a wind instrument. More recently, custom aug-
mentations for mobile devices such as passive amplication
of the built-in speakers and alternative grips [4] have been
proposed with the purpose of extending instrument design
possibilities.
Mobile device augmentation using low cost components
such as common cardboard has been used also for purposes
other than music. Google Cardboard 3 is intended as an af-
fordable way to experience virtual reality using a standard
smartphone housed in a cardboard fold-out viewer equipped
with plastic lenses. Another example of cardboard exten-
sions designed for a mobile device are the Nintendo Labo 4
kits for the Nintendo Switch mobile videogaming console.
These cardboards cut-outs are to be assembled in combina-
tion with the console display and controllers (the Joy-Con,
which features several motion sensing technologies [12]).
These kits were designed also for educational purposes, as
they can also be used|along with the console and the ac-
companying software|to teach basic principles of physics,
music, and other subjects. Notably, one of the kits consists
in a working cardboard toy piano that holds the console
display as a music stand.
The properties of cardboard have also been exploited to
amplify sound signals. In projects such as the \Cardboard
Speaker-Table"5 cardboard is paired with transducers to
acoustically amplify the audio signals coming from a mobile
device. Small transducers have been used extensively in the
sonic arts to transmit vibrations to objects of various shapes
and materials with the purpose of creating alternative ways
of producing and experiencing sound. For example, Attila

Faravelli's \Aural Tool #1: Trifoglio" 6 consists of transduc-
ers applied on a purposely designed object made of curved
sheets. By playing back dedicated compositions loaded on
a built-in digital player, listeners can experience the music
through an omnidirectional sound eld and acoustic vibra-
tions felt by holding the object in their hands.
The instrument presented in this paper, the Sibilim, was
designed to be a low-cost project that leverages on the
possibilities aﬀorded by the ubiquity mobile devices and
the properties of cardboard. Sibilim acts as a smartphone
cardboard resonance box. The smartphone video camera
tracks the movement of push-buttons used to play chords
and scales. The buttons can be mapped to a specic set of
sounds or MIDI parameter and can be easily recongured
without the need of hard rewiring the system. The sound
of the instrument is generated by synthesis or sample play-
back, and can be amplied by means of a transducer placed
on the cardboard panels. Sibilim is targeted at students
learning basic music concepts and aims at encouraging the
exploration of instrument design and customisation thanks
to the simplicity and aﬀordability of its components.
2. INTERFACE DESIGN
This section describes the material composition and the sys-
tem architecture of Sibilim. The musical instrument has
two main parts: a cardboard box and a smartphone de-
vice. The physical interaction with the instrument is made
mainly through push buttons that work similarly to key-
board keys, switching a musical note to the on state when
pressed, and to the oﬀ state when released. Nonetheless,
the push buttons can also be mapped to several control
parameters, allowing many sound possibilities. The smart-
phone is attached to the cardboard box and can receive
input parameters also through its multitouch screen. A ded-
icated sound synthesis and sample playback application is
used to generate sound.
Sibilin was designed so that assembling it is very simple,
and fun for the user. Thus, the entire instrument body is
made of cardboard, push buttons built of wood with metal
springs, and an acrylic mirror. There is no need for hard
wires in this instrument since the proposed interface uses
optical information to detect the buttons activation. How-
ever, optionally, it is possible to connect an active trans-
ducer to the smartphone and produce a much louder sound
thanks to the vibrations amplied by the cardboard panels.
Figure 1 presents a prototype version of Sibilin.
2.1 Interface Architecture
The schematic of the system operation, is presented in Fig-
ure 2. The instrument body is a cardboard box (1), with
several push buttons on the top (2) connected to markers
inside the box (3). The image of each marker is reected by
the mirror (4) through a pinhole (5) and captured by the
smartphone camera (6) placed on top of the box. The ded-
icated mobile app uses computer vision algorithms to track
the position of all the markers[11].
The system architecture permits many push-button lay-
outs, allowing rapid creation and customisation of new mu-
sical interfaces. The only limitation is that the marker of
each push-button must be visible within the smartphone
camera eld of view.
2.1.1 System calibration
In order to start using the instrument, the user has to lay
the smartphone over the box so that the camera is placed
6http://shop.plattfon.ch/

on the small aperture located on the box cover. The rst
time it is used, the system runs a learning procedure to
detect and store each marker position. Moreover, at this
stage, the user can map each marker to a specic control
parameter or musical note (using MIDI specications[3]).
After the learning stage, for each new system initialization,
the marker positions and mappings are restored, and the vi-
sion algorithm performs an automatic calibration to x and
compensate any deviation in the placement of the smart-
phone.
2.1.2 Outliers removal
Ideally, the vision system should detect exactly the same
number of markers that are present inside the box. How-
ever, shadows of markers or even dust in the mirror might
cause spurious detection. The vision system uses several
features extracted from the image of each marker to remove
these outliers, such as colour, shape, size, convexity, and
neighbourhood connectivity. These features are incorpo-
rated to a set of heuristics during the learning stage. Later,
during the execution time, these heuristics are used to lter
any marker detection that are likely to be a false positive.
2.1.3 Mapping of Controls
The discrete range of possible locations of each marker can
be mapped to control parameters for sound generation and
transformation. There is also the option for exclusively
two state conditions. This option can be applied as an on-
set/oﬀset concept, where each marker can be in state ON
(attack phase of the ADSR envelope) or OFF (release phase
of the ADSR envelope). Figure 3 illustrates the exclusively
two state condition, which is implemented with the help of a
xed threshold. When a marker moves far enough from the
resting position, crossing the threshold, the system changes
the state from OFF to ON. When the user release the push
button, the marker returns to the resting position, changing
inversely the state from ON to OFF.
To simulate MIDI velocity, the Sibilim model computes
the time diﬀerence obtained between the transition of marker
positions from the OFF to the ON states. The velocity ∆ V
in pixels is then converted to sound amplitude A in the
range [0 ; 1] by the equation 1:
A = 1
maxf∆V; 1g; (1)
where  is a tuning parameter that depends on the layout
of the instrument, size and distance of markers.
2.1.4 Computational feasibility
16
Figure 2: Schematic of the optical push-button sys-
tem.
Figure 3: ON/OFF states model.
The vision system conguration implemented in this model
captures 60 video frames per second. Despite this frame
rate give us considerable latency (16 :6ms) in the input of
the system, we have empirically note that the push-buttons
in format of pistons act masking, in some degree, part of
the human perception of this latency. The computer vi-
sion algorithm can be congured to use lower frame rates
in order to reduce computation cost. This is an important
feature since a main concern about the use of smartphones
is the durability of batteries. In section 4, we present an
experiment designed to quantify the balance between the
perceived latency and the computational need of the sys-
tem.
2.1.5 Sound generation
Modern smartphones admits the use of several audio li-
braries and frameworks for implementation of techniques
for sound synthesis and sample playback [9, 10, 5, 7]. The
sound generation module of the Sibilim instrument uses the

JUCE framework 7, which promotes rapid implementation
of audio synthesis and sample-playback routines, and can
deploy the Sibilim app to multiple platforms.
2.1.6 Audio Ampliﬁcation
Optionally, the proposed instrument can be actively ampli-
ed to make it sound louder. In our model, the audio from
the smartphone is amplied by a low voltage audio power
amplier (LM386 based module 8 with 9V battery), which
drives the signal to a transducer (exciter speaker) attached
to one internal side of the box. Figure 2-(7) shows this
optional audio connection.
2.1.7 Musical controls
The app implements musical controls commonly found in
commercial electronic keyboards, as octave and key shift,
as well as instrument timbre selection. All these functions
can be accessed through the smartphone touchscreen.
3. USE CASE: EDUCATIONAL DESIGN
Sibilim allows quick customisation for diﬀerent uses. Here,
we present the outcomes of the rst use of Sibilim for music
education. In this use case, the goal was to aid the study
of harmonic perception and melodic sight-singing, based on
the Musicalization of Adults through the Voice (MAaV)
method [2]. The MAaV method is a musicalization ap-
proach that starts from the Tonal System and the Relative
Solfege of the Scale Degrees. In this method, beginners prc-
tice melodies with the extension of an octave and a half
(from 5 to 2 degrees), and their sight-singing becomes ac-
companied by Tonic and Subdominant triads (I or i, and IV
or iv, respectively) and Dominant seventh chord (V7) over
the diatonic scales, in all major and minor-harmonic scales.
3.1 Buttons layout
Based on the beginners level of MAaV method, the Sibilim
oﬀers an specic layout for the push-buttons, dening, as
a consequence, the instrument sound possibilities. The dis-
tance between the buttons was based on the measurement
between the keys of a keyboard of general acoustic piano
(2:2 cm); and the tension of the springs was determined,
empirically. In the latter case, several users were asked to
indicate the spring that brought them greater comfort for
7http://juce.com
8http://www.ti.com/product/LM386
17
the ngers. The researchers adopted the spring that re-
ceived the highest positive score. All these measures were
taken to ensure healthy ergonomic conditions for users.
As illustrated by gray circles in the Figure 4, the are
two groups of buttons in this instrument architecture. The
group formed by twelve buttons corresponds to the melodic
notes and the group formed by only thee buttons are de-
signed to activate chords (harmonic function).
3.1.1 Sound Production
The instrument oﬀers two types of sounds: single notes,
when the melodic buttons are pressed; and simultaneous
pitches, in preset chords, when the harmonic buttons are
pressed.
By pressing the melody buttons in sequence, from right
to left and from bottom to top, the user listens to the inter-
val relations of the major or minor harmonic scales (hence
already with the seventh degree changed), starting at the
fth degree of the corresponding tonality. This sequence of
notes contains twelve diatonic sounds, which corresponds to
one and a half octaves, which is the range of many popular
songbook melodies as well as the range that a person with
little singing practice can emit eﬀortlessly [2]. To extend the
range of her/his voice, or to nd a more comfortable tessi-
tura, the user can transpose the selected part by choosing a
new key in the App visual interface.
According to the mode and the tonality of each song or
sight-singing exercise, the user can bind the exact pitches
of the melody and chords buttons together. The user ac-
cesses the twelve buttons of the Sibilim's melodic keyboard
with her/his left hand, and the three harmonic buttons with
her/his right hand. In both cases, she/he uses only the ring,
middle and index nger, decreasing technical skill require-
ments for the hands.
It is worth noting that the relative positions of the but-
tons on the keyboard have direct inuence on the camera
view since the image produced from the markers is reected
by the mirror and need to be fully captured by the camera of
the smartphone. Several attempts have led the researchers
to some relevant decisions about the locations of the mark-
ers, regarding the distance between them and the mirror,
and the ergonomics of the keyboard.
3.2 Tonal approach
The tonality is structured, basically, on the tension versus
rest relationship, established between the Dominant Sev-
enth chords and the Tonic chords [1]. The Seventh chords
of the Dominant are the same for both major tone and its
minor harmonic homonym; the chords of three sounds built
on the Tonic can be Major or Minor. The same happens
with the Subdominant chords, which can either lead from
rest to tension, or from tension to rest. Thus, by learning to
play and listen to these three chords by placing them cor-
rectly on a melodic design, the user has an aunderstanng
of the tonal centre is able to follow simple tonal songs.
The idea of accompanied melody, which was born with
the Continuous Bass (c. XVI) and evolved until the Lieder
(c. XIX), is still widely employed in contemporary western
popular music [1]. Our instrument prototype is built to ex-
plore this concept. The user can use the set of melodic but-
tons to learn a new song or to check an intonation pattern.
Moreover, Sibilim permits an alternative format of musical
execution, in which the melodic buttons activate bass notes
in counterpoint with the melody that the singer is intoning.
In this case, the performance may become more rewarding
and rich if the users, with their right hand, activates chords
through the harmonic buttons.
In summary, the user can use the same ngerings as
well as the same set of buttons, to perform melodic lines
and chords with diﬀerent interval relationships and abso-
lute pitches, as direct consequence of the previously selected
scale in the App. These features allow the user to sing and
play an accompaniment during the performance of a sim-
ple tonal repertoire. With this conguration, learners can
sing and play with varied instrumental technical execution
schemes, at a comfortable pitch for their voice and without
the need of transposing key by changing ngerings. These
features make the Sibilin a fun and easy instrument to play,
both when practicing alone or with other musicians.

4. EXPERIMENT
A group of twelve adults participated in an experimental
workshop to verify the validity of the proposed musical in-
terface. On January 25, 2019, between 14h and 16h, in the
Auditorium Prof. Castilho of the Institute of Informatics of
UFRGS.
Among the participants, 50% were women and 50% were
men, whose ages range from 20 to 48, and professional char-
acteristics were very diﬀerent from each other. However, all
of them had some connection with the process of creation
and the utility of this new instrument: three music teachers
of elementary school, one amateur musician, one electrical
engineer, two software developers, one software engineer,
three fellows without knowledge of music nor computer sci-
ence, one production assistant with special cognitive needs.
The general goal of this experiment was to evaluate as-
pects related to the usability of Sibilim in the context of
the MAaV method. The specic objectives were: to de-
scribe the reaction of the test group to the Sibilim; to get
a set of user evaluations; to pair considerations and sugges-
tions made by musicians and non-musicians; and to decide
about any changes needed in the instrument's original de-
sign. The experiment was conducted using two prototypes
of Sibilim. One instrument was used with an iPhone 8 and
the other was used with an iPhone 6s.
4.1 Protocol
The scheduled meeting for data collection began with the
presentation of the participants, most of whom did not
know each other. After that initial moment, for about ten
minutes, the researchers presented the instrument, talking
about its history and construction aspects. They then or-
ganised the participants into two groups, according to their
previous musical experiences. Each of the two groups re-
ceived a prototype of the Sibilim. For about thirty min-
utes, participants were asked to explore it together spon-
taneously. After this free moment of exploration, the re-
searchers conducted some musical activities, including melo-
dic and harmonic elements, which employed the technical
resources available in the instrument. While the activi-
ties took place, the researchers explained the instrument
features and lled the participants' questionnaire. In the
end, the twelve participants answered the questionnaire and
collaborated with ideas and suggestions, in an open semi-
structured debate for data collection.
In order to employ a consistent methodology for our ex-
periments, we have used the DTA Discursive Textual Anal-
ysis [6, 8] technique in distinct phases of this study. DTA
is an analytical tool for qualitative analysis of textual and
discursive information widely used in education research.
This protocol has three main steps: Unitarization, Catego-
rization and Production of Metatext.

4.2 Discussion
The data collection instruments (questionnaire and semi-
structured interview script) and the answers from all par-
ticipants can be seen in the Table 1. This table shows the
average and standard deviation of answers in the format
of 5-point Likert-scale statements. In the most cases, the
standard deviation is lower than 1.0, indicating a strong
agreement among the participants.
All participants were enthusiastic about the simplicity
of the instrument's construction and handling. They also
stated their need for the autonomous, alone and indepen-
dent assessment of the learning of harmonic perception and
melodic musical reading. While referring to distinct aspects,
they all stated that they felt good by exploring the possi-
bilities of the instrument and trying to understand under
what circumstances it could be used as a proper musical
instrument. They used words such as curiosity, freedom,
interest, fun, joy, motivation and even gratitude to express
what they felt during the experiment. They also reported
a general excitement about the instrument as all the par-
ticipants all seemed anxious to play. A third of the partici-
pants stated that they had never seen any other similar in-
strument. Participant P1 has identied the possibility that
each box could be customised by the user, using stickers and
colours. P1 also pointed out the possibility of integrating
languages and artistic expressions, supporting new creative
ways and improving the educational process. Other mani-
festations that complement the characterisation of the type
of response awakened by the Sibilim are: a desire to be part
of a Sibilim orchestra; the willingness to create tutorials
for their musical and multimedia work; and an impulse to
spread it among their students.
The suggestions referred to the aspects of the physical
construction of the instrument, the technological resources
used, and the procedures pertinent to its use and handling.
On the material construction of the Sibilim, the users sug-
gested greater precision in the mechanisms of control and
activation of the sounds. They also recommended enhance-
ment of dynamics and enrichment of timber les. It could
be a good idea to make a lateral opening in the box, so
that the movements of the markers, in its interior, can be
appreciated by the audience. In the same way, they recom-
mended insertion of a latch, fold or double-sided adhesive
tape to hold the phone to the carton. Regarding its tech-
nological requirement, the opinion was that the quality re-
quired for the mobile processor could limit its reach to the
target audience.
The participants identied that the use of Sibilim brings
the idea of Continuous Bass, implying reading and practis-
ing melodies and harmony. Thus, the eﬀective use of the
instrument requires knowledge of musical theory, besides
notions of technology and motor skills. For example, one of
the participants stated that they had not been able to test
all the features because they did not know how to do it, sug-
gesting that they might be excessive. Others said it took
a long time to recognise all the possibilities. Reacting to
these observations, the idea of opening a space for debates
and exhibitions, associated with the distribution of the in-
strument, was representative. Some participants suggested
a broadening of the concept about the target audience, not
only targeting singers and adults; they also thought about
children. Others also suggested the provision of training
courses for teachers and educational videos on the Internet.
Finally, they indicated the creation of a site for postings sent
by users, to exchange experiences about their possibilities
of use.
5. CONCLUSION
This paper presented a new musical interface named Sibilim.
The mechanical and physical requirements for the construc-
tion of the Sibilim are elementary. It consists of a smart-
phone positioned on a cardboard box with a mirror and a
transducer inside. On the upper face of this box, there are
push-buttons attached to sticks and regulated by springs.
These rods extend into the cardboard box and at the other
end have markers. The smartphone capture and track the
movement of these markers through its video camera, and a
sample-playback algorithm generates sounds in response to
such movement. The instrument layout includes twelve sin-
gle note push-buttons for the left hand and three harmonic
(chord) push-buttons for the right hand.
The design of this interface was also planned to follow the
educational approach proposed by the MAaV method [2].
This method addresses the Tonal Music System and focuses
on the Majors and Minors Harmonics modes, and the Rel-
ative sight-singing of the Scale Degrees. The teaching pro-
cedures of MAaV are based on the practice of songs accom-
panied by some harmonic instrument, and employ chords
of the Dominant Seventh Chord (V7), Tonic (I and i) and
Subdominant (IV and iv).
An experimental evaluation was conducted with twelve
people representing diﬀerent professions, ages and musical
knowledge. This study evaluated the proposed interface
regarding the feasibility of use and acceptance, as well as
specic aspects: surprise factor, ergonomics, system con-
guration, musical features, and interface. All the partici-
pants in the study were enthusiastic and motivated to use
it. Feedback from these participants was registered using
a 5-point Likert-scale. The nal report indicates that the
prototype presents good controllability. However, there are
still many challenges that should be addressed in order to
improve the Sibilim and enhance user experience. Based on
19
the answers from the twelve participants of this experiment,
it is clear that the system initialisation must be improved,
facilitating the smartphone conguration at the instrument
initialisation stage. The main dissatisfaction during the ex-
perimental use of the prototype is related to the sensitivity
of the dynamics. This means that the estimated MIDI ve-
locity through Equation 1 is not accurate enough. Since
the lack of controllability over the dynamics has direct in-
uence on the ADSR envelope, we believe that complaints
about the instrument timbre might be correlated. Latency
is a critical factor in any digital music instrument, and our
prototype has shown satisfactory latency when using the
camera frame rate set up to 60fps. This is an important
result since now we know the proposed optical interface is
feasible in modern smartphones. However, as we increase
the computational power, the consumption of the battery
also increase. Thus, still the need for more eﬃcient vision
algorithms to make the batteries lasting longer.
As future work, we plan to focus our eﬀorts on improving
the control of dynamics and reducing the computational
complexity of the algorithms used in the Sibilim interface.
