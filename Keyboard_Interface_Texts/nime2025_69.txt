Abstract
We present the design, prototype implementation, and informal
testing of a distributed web-based networked music performance
(NMP) system for collaborative improvisation and experimen-
tation. Influenced by composition and interaction design tech-
niques from a wide range of work on collaborative virtual music
environments, rather than treating latency as inherently disrup-
tive to the musical and social engagement that characterizes tra-
ditional performance, we incorporate and exploit network delay
to facilitate and visualize them, providing a novel approach to cre-
ating “jam session”-like experiences without a separate audience.
During sessions, users collaboratively perform semi-improvised
music in quasi-real time. The production and interpretation of
individual musical gestures (“drum hits”) are visualized in a con-
tinuously devised feedback network. The music produced can
be treated as a starting point for compositions developed asyn-
chronously, or as complete pieces of music produced live.

1 Introduction
In this paper, we present the design, prototype implementation,
and informal testing of a distributed web-based networked mu-
sic performance (NMP) system for collaborative semi-structured
group improvisation. The system implements a novel musical
and visual strategy that incorporates and disguises end-to-end
communication latencies on the order of seconds between dis-
tributed users. Said strategy also accommodates co-located users;
if multiple instances of the client application are open at the
same time in the same space, their overlapping output maintains
musical (rhythmic) coherence. When a performance is complete,
the system distributes records of users’ musical activity. These
can be used as starting points for compositions developed asyn-
chronously. The system then offers a specialized collaborative
environment where users can create distinctive music together

during quasi-real time performances; the results of said perfor-
mances can be seamlessly integrated into their existing composi-
tional workflows.
We first explore why established conventions for traditional
(co-located, with familiar instruments) collaborative improvi-
sational performance make it feel live to actively participating
performers and passive audience members. We review contempo-
rary literature on liveness in performance and suggest that this is
due to performers’ clear and continuous demonstration of agency
over musical output, which is possible due to the ample, legible
and continuous multi-sensory feedback found in traditional set-
tings. We discuss how and why novel distributed networked
music performance (NMP) systems subject to significant latency
favor a kind of performance that demands less musical awareness,
thus reflecting less performer agency in musical output.
We explore successful strategies from existing distributed NMP
tools for facilitating quasi-real time interaction and “performer-
centered” performance in the face of significant communication
latency. We review techniques for promoting awareness in sev-
eral novel performance contexts, adapt them to a distributed
setting if necessary. We incorporate these techniques into a mu-
sical and visual paradigm for a prototype system, which includes
the responsibilities of different participating users, the UI com-
ponents that facilitate their interaction, and the musical delays
that hide transmission latency. We then describe a prototype im-
plementation of the system and its components. We describe the
details of several informal tests of the system, in which testers
provided their informed consent, and present a piece of music
composed asynchronously post-performance from records of
these test sessions.
We hope that this work inspires more musicians and tech-
nologists to explore latency, particularly at longer timescales,
as a compositional tool, rather than treating it as a problem to
eliminate. We also hope that the work inspires other NMP devel-
opers to explore real-time interaction as an ideation exercise for
asynchronous composition.

supplementary materials referenced throughout the paper, are

2 Background And Related Work
2.1 Conventions For Traditional Performance
Collective improvisational performance or jamming involves
quasi-real time interaction and in-time [26] music creation. Per-
formers simultaneously create and perceive a complete piece
of music. Musical goals usually involve coherence in combined
ensemble output [30] and complexity along musical dimensions
of salience, such as rhythm or texture [39].
Traditionally, performers and audiences are co-located [47] to
the extent that auditory and visual latency are not disruptive to
musical coordination [2]. Performers utilize “traditional” instru-
ments, whose musical patterns and degree of skill required for
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Ari Liloia and Roger Dannenberg
operation have, over time, become common knowledge [18, 32].
The traditional setting is characterized by visibility, in that both
performers and passive audiences can perceive the activities
and skills carried out to fulfill musical goals [ 31]. Performers’
awareness of musical responsibilities, relationships, and musical
activity [3] is afforded by the highly visible setting. As they per-
form, they demonstrably assert musical agency [46] and witness
others doing the same. [32] and [30] provide a comprehensive
overview of these ideas from an embodied cognition perspective.
Performance is characterized by liveness, which is associated
with unique feelings that non-performed music cannot replicate.
Contemporary literature considers different perspectives for pas-
sive audiences and active performers: Performers may associate
liveness with witnessing a “dynamically performed assertion
of human presence” [ 43] in ensemble musical output. This is
reinforced by the risk present in traditional settings where meet-
ing musical goals is not guaranteed [14] and can be attributed
to user agency when present. Alternatively, from the perspec-
tive of a passive audience, a musical event can feel “live” (and
in turn, be perceived as a performance) if it effectively simu-
lates the spontaneity and interactivity usually associated with
achieving musical goals, regardless of human agency reflected in
musical output or risk involved. [1, 9, 43] provide comprehensive
overviews of these ideas.
2.2 Networked Music Performance
The Hub [ 6] are credited with introducing distributed [7] or
non-realistic [20] networked music performance, in which mu-
sicians connected over computer networks with characteristics
that disrupt conventional methods for collaboration and coordi-
nation, such as significant latency and physical distance between
users at network endpoints, interact in quasi-real time while pro-
ducing music in-time. They are also credited as progenitors of
the encompassing field now called networked music performance
(NMP), which has endured as a flexible category of musical tools.
[20, 25, 42, 49] provide comprehensive overviews of the entire
NMP space and describe how the term has developed.
We identify two main considerations in distributed NMP: how
musical timing is affected by latency, and how the lack of visi-
bility in a networked setting affects awareness, especially that
of performer agency over musical output. The following sub-
sections review established strategies addressing these issues in
novel performance contexts.
2.2.1 Effect Of Latency On Musical Timing. Both latency and
jitter (variation in latency) increase significantly and reliably
with distance between network endpoints [37]. While musicians
connected over a two-way audio stream can play with up to 75
milliseconds of latency without needing to adjust their auditory
feedback, latency in networked systems can be much higher. This
has musical consequences; certain kinds of rhythmic synchro-
nization become more difficult with jitter [25], and longer delays
make interaction feel less immediate [17].
Some NMP systems address this through musical styles less de-
pendent on precise timing, such as texture-based atmospheric mu-
sic [5]. A strategy that works with cyclical music (based around
musical cycles) is the “fake time” approach (FTA) 1, which ex-
tends latency to avoid jitter. The technique requires imposing a
set tempo, synchronizing local clocks across clients, estimating
the worst-case end-to-end latency (henceforth called 𝑊𝐶𝐿 and
1[20] survey categorized various NMP tools under this term, with [ 22] being a
significant early example
measured in milliseconds), and implementing a scheduling sys-
tem with which future execution times for transmitted data can
be scheduled. Extra latency is added to this execution time, such
that the “precedent time” [35] between transmission and message
execution upon reception is greater than or equal to𝑊𝐶𝐿 and is a
multiple of the duration of one musical cycle. Control data is then
afforded the length of one musical cycle for end-to-end trans-
mission. If players maintain their awareness of timing within
and between individual parts, combined output reconstructed
at network endpoints maintains rhythmic coherence. NINJAM
[12] and GDC [ 15] implement this technique for transmitting
and reconstructing audio and control data, respectively.
2.2.2 Effect Of Visibility On Awareness And Agency. Visibility
is less present in distributed, non-realistic NMP systems that
facilitate user interaction through digital interfaces (UIs) and
novel digital instruments (DMIs). There is precedent in NMP for
reducing the importance of performer awareness, and in turn,
that of performer agency, in producing music: Users may play
over backing tracks [40] or rearrange segments of pre-composed
music [4]. This may be done to pursue social or exploratory
goals; while early net music surveys [ 19, 49] separated these
from performance tools, contemporary overviews [20, 25] char-
acterize them as NMP. Music produced by these systems may
contain coherence and complexity not attributable to user agency.
While an audience-centered perspective of performance might
welcome this approach, we take a performer-centered approach
and explore strategies that manifest musical agency and facilitate
awareness in a setting subject to latency and inherently lacking
visibility.
Communication latency and novel DMIs lead to ambiguity
in other users’ responsibilities and capabilities, hindering the
development of influence patterns. To combat this, some tools
enforce “follower-leader” relationships between groups of users
[16, 40].
While visual feedback in traditional performance usually comes
from peripheral vision [ 45], direct visual feedback promotes
awareness in novel settings. [31] suggests introducing task-specific
visual artifacts in a shared space to communicate roles and activi-
ties, especially “metaphor-based mappings” referencing common
associations between action and movement. Visualizations of
musical gestures can be helpful: [48] introduces the “anticipatory
score” pattern for displaying upcoming sounds in a collectively
created scrolling score. [33] notes the value of visualizing sources
of sounds already created, and how they are “modified” as they
are perceived and reinterpreted by other musicians.
Excessive activity can crowd the virtual space [4] and obscure
which collaborative activities have the highest priority [8]. Ef-
fective approaches include using proximity in a virtual space
to communicate interdependence [44] to focusing attention on
specific regions of said shared space, as well as simply limiting
the number of participants.
However, in displaced NMP, latency prevents immediate ensemble-
wide updates to shared virtual spaces. Client-side prediction , a
pattern from video games, can be used to simulate immediate
feedback in a shared space to gestures: If visualizations of users’
own musical gestures are predictable for some time after they are
produced, they can be displayed locally before their successful
broadcast is confirmed, then reconciled if necessary afterwards
[21].

2.3 Novel Directions
NMP tools are compelling for their ability to “sonify”, or manifest
musically, network medium characteristics like latency. Most sys-
tems exploring this incorporate latency on the order of millisec-
onds into similar musical timescales, such as the pitch of a sound
[11], the parameters of spatial diffusion algorithms [10], and an
“echo” effect of roughly 100 milliseconds [41]. Little existing work
scales up latency to different musically relevant timescales.
[35] extend the FTA with the “mutual anticipated session”
(MAS), which varies precedent times between pairs of musi-
cians, such that a unique, time-shifted and rhythmically coherent
“perspective” of the ensemble’s complete musical output is con-
structed at each client, resulting in “bi-located” [ 41] rhythmic
patterns. It is novel to use scaled inter-user latencies as prece-
dent times in a MAS-like system, with care taken not to set them
below 𝑊𝐶𝐿.
While recent NIMEs address interest in novel DAW-based
solo performance [36] and collaborative simultaneous interac-
tion [27], few NMP tools exist that allow detailed asynchronous
DAW-based editing. Endlesss2, which was discontinued in June
2024, permitted downloading individual loops created during
performance as audio files. Distributing performance records
as MIDI files 3 lends itself to more DAW-based musical prac-
tices, especially for users interested in timbres not presented by
the system. While the phrase “jam session” is commonly used
in NIME proceedings to describe any collective improvisation,
the phrase’s roots in jazz [38] and the common “jam band” for-
mat [23] highlight the potential of collective improvisations as
ideation exercises. Few NMP tools explore this context.
3 Design
In this section, we present a musical and interaction paradigm
for a prototype system influenced by techniques presented in
the previous section. Physically displaced users interact over a
network, subject to significant latency and with personal com-
puters as network endpoints. An advance scheduling system is
implemented. A tempo is imposed and used to map time to beats,
which increase with time according to said tempo.
3.1 Client Classes And UI
The application implements three classes for clients, Composer,
Performer and Listener. Users interact during sessions of collabo-
rative musical activity, which are either started or stopped.
Collaborative musical activity is mediated by a two-dimensional
locally rendered interactive representation of the entire ensem-
ble, referred to henceforth as the grid. Clients are represented by
simple colored nodes on grid vertices and identifiable by client
class: Composers are red, Performers are blue, and Listeners are
green. Clients’ own nodes appear black.
3.2 Drum Hits
The widespread appeal of drums, especially in a collaborative
“drum circle” setting, can be attributed to their accessibility for
beginners and potential for advanced musicianship, making them
an ideal starting point for a DMI. The action of playing a hand
drum translates especially well to a computer keyboard-based
digital instrument, both produce sound immediately and offer a
natural rebound when “struck”.
2https://endlesss.fm/
3https://www.midi.org/specifications
The music produced using the system is percussive and based
around musical cycles. The system’s primary musical gesture
and format for instruction is the drum hit , or a Composer or
Performer pressing a key on their computer keyboard to “play”
a virtual drum. This act triggers the immediate local playback
of a drum sample, and a hit marker is immediately displayed
over the user’s node. Control data related to the pressed key
/ drum hit is then transmitted to other clients; the effect and
intended interpretation varies based on the relationship between
the transmitting and receiving client.
An advance scheduling system for musical contributions accu-
rately delays execution by an integer number of beats. Consider a
Client A that triggers a drum hit at beat 𝑏𝑆, which is received by
Client B at time 𝑏𝑅, before one musical cycle has passed. Client
A’s drum hit is played back on Client B at beat 𝑏𝑆 +𝐶, 𝐶 beats
after 𝑏𝑆. 𝐶 is such that the duration of 𝐶 beats is greater than or
equal to 𝑊𝐶𝐿.
3.3 Client Roles
Composers can click and drag their nodes to draw paths along
grid lines, or connections, between themselves and Performer
nodes. When a Composer plays a drum (triggers a drum hit), one
corresponding hit marker per connection appears over its node.
These hit markers then travel along connections towards Per-
formers over some integer number of beats. The time it takes for
a hit marker to move from one node to another is the procession
time; procession times are quantized to beat multiples. Unless
otherwise noted, the procession time of a Composer’s hit marker
in beats is the length of the connection along which it travels in
grid lines. Composers can click on connections they have drawn
to delete them. Multiple Composers can be connected to the
same Performer; if their pacing and timing are consistent, their
combined output at the Performer is rhythmically coherent.
extras/gifs/composer.gif on the project GitHub page shows
a Composer drawing a connection between itself and a Performer,
playing several drum hits, then deleting the connection. Note
that the hit markers start out moving slower, then speed up. This
is explained in Section 4.6.
Performers follow the motion of composer hit markers like a
scrolling score, playing drums as they arrive at their nodes. Given
that nodes are quantized to grid vertices and procession times
are quantized to beat multiples, if Composers maintain pacing
and timing between parts, Performers “perceive” rhythmically
coherent versions of combined output. When a Performer plays
a drum, a 45-degree rotated square “wavefront” ripples outwards
from its avatar. This shape is chosen because it allows a point
on the wavefront to move either one grid line (the point on the
vertex of the square) or across the diagonal of one grid square (the
equivalent of two grid lines) in one beat. Unless otherwise noted,
the procession time of a Performer’s hit marker in beats is the
distance between itself and any Listener in grid lines. Performer
hit markers eventually “collide” with all listener nodes.
extras/gifs/performer.gif on the project GitHub page
shows a Performer responding to drum hits from a Composer,
attempting to time the arrival of the hit markers with its own
drum hits. Note that the hit markers start out moving slower,
then speed up. This is explained in Section 4.6.
Listeners perceive the combined output of all performers; each
Performer drum hit arriving at their node plays back a drum
sound in their client. Unlike Composer drum hits, Performer
drum hits are not “directed”: all Listeners hear drum hits from
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Ari Liloia and Roger Dannenberg
all Performers. Listeners click and drag their own nodes to ex-
perience different timing combinations of combined Performer
outputs, which, if Performers maintain pacing and timing be-
tween parts, are rhythmically coherent at the Listener. Listener
perspectives are “recorded” and distributed after sessions.
Figure 1: A section of the grid during play showing two
Performers. Performer (2) is playing much more than the
Performer (1), as evidenced by the difference in number of
Performer hit markers surrounding it.
The urgency of a hit marker is proportional to its proximity to
a node on the grid. Users are encouraged to focus on grid areas
closer to their own node; other grid activity takes place in periph-
eral vision. Users contribute to coherence in ensemble output
by monitoring other users’ playing styles via the grid, including
those to which they are not connected. For example, 1 shows a
setup with two Performers; one labeled (1) on the left side of the
figure and one labeled (2) on the right. As shown by the number
and density of square hit markers propagating outward from
Performer (2) relative to Performer (1), Performer (2) is playing
much more, and may be behaving disruptively. No Composers
are shown in the figure, but both Performers have incoming con-
nections. To discourage this behavior, a Composer connected to
Performer (2) could break their connection. Alternatively, Per-
former (1) could accommodate this behavior by adjusting their
playing to match or counter Performer (2)’s style.
In this manner, users continuously observe musical agency
propagating through a feedback network of other users, which
is continuously devised as Listeners move around and as Com-
posers edit connections and tempo. Musical agency is visualized
to promote awareness and make the experience feel “live”.
4 Implementation
In this section, we describe the prototype implementation of the
system.
4.1 Network Topology and Communication
The Global Drum Circle (GDC), a distributed web-based system to
enable drum circle performances across the Internet developed by
the same authors, was used in software that formed the basis for
this new system. Subsections 4.1 and 4.5 refer to implementation
details slightly or completely unchanged from the 2022 version
of this software.
The prototype back end is implemented using Java 4 and
Maven 5, and builds off the Webbit 6 base code for base code
for a WebSocket and HTTP server. The front end is implemented
using p5js 7. Client-side audio playback is implemented using the
WebAudio API8. Communication takes place over WebSockets
9 using O2lite 10. The prototype implements a “hub-and-spoke”
network topology, in which information from end users is routed
through and stored on a central server; it is then straightforward
to log performance data as it is routed through the system, main-
tain a master clock, and reject or reconcile invalid actions from
clients.
Before sessions, one user downloads the application, compiles
it on a virtual machine with a public IP address, and indepen-
dently distributes a link to the browser-based client application.
4.2 Upper Bound For End-To-End
Communication
It is necessary to pick a value for the 𝑊𝐶𝐿, or the upper bound
for end-to-end communication. In the interest of allowing for
experimentation with different network conditions, we allow
this value to be easily set during setup. However, we implement
a default value of 3500 ms. At time of writing, Google Cloud’s
virtual machine performance dashboard gives the highest me-
dian round-trip transmission time between a cloud region and
external endpoint (i.e. from external endpoint to cloud region
to external endpoint) as 350 milliseconds 11; our default value is
then order of magnitude above this for safety. During informal
tests with distributed users, no issues suggesting a higher 𝑊𝐶𝐿
was necessary presented themselves.
4.3 Role Choice And Setup
Upon connecting to the server, the client prompts users to enter
authentication credentials and choose a client class. A chat win-
dow visible during setup explains metrics for success related to
the role chosen. During this process, the client’s local clock and
timemap synchronize with the server, and client-server round-
trip time (RTT) is crudely estimated using 𝑁 O2lite messages
initially spaced by 𝑆 milliseconds and increasing by a factor of 𝐹
for each subsequent measurement. The implementation allows
these values to be chosen during setup, but default values𝑁 = 10,
𝑆 = 20 and 𝐹 = 2 are set, as this takes roughly 20 seconds. Testing
implied that the average setup took slightly more time than this.
The client then sends this value to the server, which asso-
ciates it with the client instance. Client instances that complete
this process are validated. As shown in Figure 2, a live count of
validated clients by class is displayed; once one client of each
class has been validated, they can vote to confirm themselves as
session participants. Voting restarts if a new client is validated
or a validated client drops out.

class has been validated.
4.4 Converting RTTs to Initial Distances On
Grid
RTTs are roughly estimated to generate initial node placements
on the grid. In a process carried out on the server, client instances
are modeled as masses connected by springs with rest lengths pro-
portional to the sum of their RTTs. Forces in x and y are calculated
iteratively to displace nodes; each node’s position is quantized
to a 𝐺 by 𝐺 grid in random order [13]. After 𝑀 iterations, nodes
achieve relative distances approximately proportional to their
scaled transmission times. While 𝐺 and 𝑀 can be customized by
the user during setup, we set default values of 𝐺 = 16, so that a
hit marker traveling across the grid in a straight line will do so
in four measures, and 𝑀 = 1000, as all realistic node and RTT
configurations tested during development converged within this
many iterations. Latency is thus manifested on a novel musical
timescale. The choice of 𝐺 also sets a constraint of 𝐺∗𝐺 on the
number of users that can join a session.
4.5 Role-Specific UI Components and Abilities
When the server finishes this calculation, it broadcasts grid po-
sitions to users, which then display said grid alongside private
and/or role-specific UI elements. All clients implement a tempo
indicator, a mixer for controlling different drum volumes (other
drums, their own drums, metronome drums), a “started/stopped”
indicator, and a series of lights that blink in sync with the metronome.
The metronome helps Composers and Performers maintain their
pacing and timing; its volume can also be changed. The ensemble
begins in the “stopped” state. Any Composer can initiate play.
Client classes’ private UI components differ in small ways. The
tempo wheel and start/stop indicator in the composer interface
are interactive, any composer can interact with them to initiate
changes to the state of the ensemble. Figure 3 shows the Listener,
Performer and Composer private UI components.
Figure 3: Private UI components from left to right: Listener,
Performer, Composer. Each “Volume controls” component
has a slider for each source of drum the client class “per-
ceives”.
As mentioned earlier, a Composer or Performer pressing a
key triggers local playback of one of two conga drum samples,
based on whether the key pressed is on the left or right side of
the user’s keyboard.
The prototype does not implement functionality for changing
these drum sounds; all Composers and Performers have access to
the same two sounds. Both drums produce identical hit markers
on the grid.
4.6 Hidden Delay
Procession times do not accommodate transmission delay, thus,
we introduce another “hidden” delay 𝐻 ≥𝑊𝐶𝐿 between one
client’s action and its display time on other clients. Figure 4 is a
timing diagram of the general pattern of end-to-end communica-
tion from Composer to Performer / from Performer to Listener.
Figure 4: A Composer / Performer plays a drum at time 𝑡𝑇,
which is scheduled for display on a Performer / Listener
at 𝑡𝑉, such that 𝑡𝑉 −𝑡𝑇 ≥𝑊𝐶𝐿. It is actually received at 𝑡𝑅,
ahead of the worst-case scenario. At 𝑡𝑉 it is displayed in
the client and begins to move away from the Composer /
Performer node, reaching the Performer / Listener node at
time 𝑡𝐸, such that 𝑡𝐸 −𝑡𝑉 is the procession time.
In addition to accommodating the worst-case transmission
latency 𝑊𝐶𝐿, the hidden delay ensures that the overlapping
output of multiple clients maintains rhythmic coherence and
“shifts” users’ timelines forward, allowing accurate representation
of Performer response times to Composer drum hits to all clients.
4.6.1 Maintaining Rhythmic Coherence In Overlapping Client
Output. While the system is geared towards distributed (visually
and sonically isolated) users, requiring three remote users is
inconvenient for demonstration, and potential users may hesitate
to organize a group solely to test it, so we allow users to operate
multiple clients on the same machine. It then becomes important
to consider rhythmic coherence in overlapping output of multiple
overlapping client instances. To accommodate this, we set 𝐻 =
𝑥𝐵 where 𝑥 is an integer and 𝐵 is the duration of one beat in
milliseconds, such that 𝐻 is “beat-aligned”. The implementation
sets 𝑥 = 4; Figure 6 reflects this choice. This value can be changed
during setup.
The maximum tempo permitted by the system is calculated
using 60 ∗𝑥/(𝐻 ∗1000), given aforementioned default values,
this is 60 ∗4/3.5 = (60 ∗4)/3.5 = 68.57 ≈68, such that procession
times can be one beat long without being smaller than 𝑊𝐶𝐿.
4.6.2 Displaying Performer Response Times. To promote aware-
ness, we maintain Performers’ responsiveness to hit markers
across clients; their skill can be assessed by the degree of simul-
taneity of the arrival of a Composer hit marker at their node
and the appearance of a Performer hit marker. While Performers
see Conductor actions delayed to hide latency to the Performer,
to create the illusion of instantaneous response from the Per-
former, Composers must also see Performer actions delayed by
another 𝐻; the same goes for Performers and Listeners. Given
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Ari Liloia and Roger Dannenberg
that the movement of hit markers is completely deterministic, we
disguise delay by implementing a kind of client-side prediction:
Actions requiring responses are delayed by 2𝐻 and others by
𝐻. Users’ own drum hits are displayed immediately but move at
different rates, such that all drum hits are generally one grid line
away from their source at the same time. Thus, it is appropriate
to display and play back users’ own drum hits immediately in
their client application, as confirmation of reception occurs once
a hit marker has moved one grid unit from the node position.
Immediate responsiveness to user actions is a favorable trait of
DMIs [28] and contributes to the feeling of liveness.
Figure 5 shows an example section of the grid - a Composer (1),
Performer (2) and Listener (3) are lined up such that the “life cycle”
of a drum hit would be represented by a hit marker moving from
left to right, from Composer to Performer and from Performer to
Listener. Another Composer (4) and Performer (5) are present,
representing all possible perspectives.
We show this process as applied to Figure 5, which covers all
possible user perspectives, in Figure 6.

poser (1), Performer (2) and Listener (3) arranged in a hor-
izontal line, as well as a Composer (4) and Performer (5)
not in said line.
Figure 6: Hit marker distance from composer (1) avatar
in grid lines over time. Red lines represent Composer
hit markers, blue represent Performer hit markers. The
same event is presented in four different ways: From the
perspective of Composer (1) (top left), Performer (2) (top
right), Composer (4) (bottom right), and Listener (3) and
Performer (5), who perceive the same path (bottom left).

shows the movement of Composer and Performer hit markers
over time as illustrated in Figure 6 for the configuration of nodes
in Figure 5.
When play has been stopped or a client suddenly disconnects,
an interruption window covers the grid to express that normal
play is no longer possible.
4.7 Conflict Resolution And Verification
As the server maintains the state of the ensemble, it maintains
a record of occupied grid positions and rejects invalid actions.
Drum hit messages, changes in tempo, Listener positions, and
newly drawn connections are followed by cooldown periods ex-
ceeding 𝑊𝐶𝐿, during which time they cannot perform other
actions and the change is afforded the appropriate amount of
time for transmission throughout the ensemble. Performer drums
are muted to listeners during their cooldown periods.
extras/gifs/listener_cooldown.gif on the project GitHub
page shows a Listener clicking on its node, moving it to a dif-
ferent location, and experiencing the cooldown time, which is
visualized as a small countdown over the node.
4.8 Logging Performance Information / MIDI
File Reconstruction
The server continuously logs tempo changes, drum hits, and
cooldown periods to reconstruct each Listener’s unique perspec-
tive. These logs are converted to CSV files and written to one
MIDI file per listener; with each Performer’s contribution on a
separate track. Once MIDI files are generated, the client displays
download buttons that send HTTP POST requests for specific
files.
5 Testing
5.1 Test Session
An informal testing session was carried out with three distributed
participants, all of whom provided their informed consent. Par-
ticipants first met over a video call and were shown a slideshow
introducing the project. A link to the client application was then
distributed. Three rounds of play were carried out with the sys-
tem: The first, a “free for all”, gauged the clarity of class-specific
instructions provided during setup. No further instructions were
given during performance; confusions were addressed and re-
solved afterwards. In the second round of play, all users switched
roles. In the third round, two users managed two clients’ respon-
sibilities with two open tabs; one controlled a Performer and a
Listener, one controlled two Listeners, and another controlled a
Composer. Data was logged in all three rounds and distributed
as MIDI files; no issues were encountered when opening them
in a range of DAWs. Suggestions from the test session since im-
plemented in the prototype include making clients’ nodes more
identifiable on the grid and clarifying the instructions given dur-
ing setup. The MIDI and CSV files are available on the project
GitHub page under extras/logs.
5.2 Complete Piece of Music
A piece of music composed by the first author based on the third
test session MIDI files is available on the project GitHub page
under extras/composition.wav.
The test session MIDI is voiced using a marimba soundfont
from the 1928 Steinway Piano Kontakt library by 8dio 12; the
mallet sounds are percussive and maintain the quality of the
prototype’s conga sounds, but are pitched differently to make
the piece more compelling. To make sure the parts of the piece

that originated from the test session were identifiable, no more
overtly rhythmic elements were added.
The atmospheric sounds accompanying the marimba were
generated using Synplant by Sonic Charge 13, the SoundMagic
Spectral plugin suite by Michael Norris 14, and the standalone
Argeïphontes Lyre application by Akira Rabelais 15.
From here, the three Listeners involved in the session are
referred to as Listeners 0, 4 and 5, as given by their IDs in
session_3_log.csv. During this session, the Performer repeat-
edly cycled through three motifs: a series of regular eighth notes,
followed by a period of near-silence, followed by chaotic playing.
The complete work is divided into three sections that mirror
each of these motifs. The first section of the piece (0:00 - 0:44)
uses MIDI from Listeners 4 and 5; they are positioned at differ-
ent distances from the Performer, creating a “call and response”
effect in their combined parts. The second section of the piece
(0:44 - 1:03) begins as the mallets fade out and the atmospheric
sounds become louder. The third section (1:03 - 2:08) begins as
the mallets fade back in, becomes more chaotic up to 1:40, then
gets quieter as the piece fades out.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented the design motivations, prototype
implementation, and informal testing of a distributed web-based
NMP system for collaborative improvisation and experimenta-
tion.a
The process by which latency is estimated in the prototype,
while crude and not thorough, generated a reasonable set of val-
ues for use as avatar positions. However, future work will explore
more accurate measurements of inter-user latency, potentially
using an adaptive algorithm or more measurements fanned out
over a longer period of time. User feedback also suggests a more
legible scrolling score for Performers than the grid would be
useful.
Future work could also include implementing functionality for
more complex sound design. While this could be an interesting
direction, we acknowledge that music producers are unlikely to
abandon established sound design or sampling workflows for
browser-based alternatives, and that this system is appealing for
its use as a specialized collaborative environment where users
can create distinctive music together during quasi-real time per-
formances, rather than a full DAW. A more compelling approach
is to focus on a wider range of post-session editing capabilities,
or on performance capabilities that do not overwhelm the core
collaborative experience, such as allowing users to upload their
own custom drum samples. In the current prototype, which gives
all clients the same drum samples, the grid is mostly responsible
for helping users differentiate each others’ contributions. Adding
unique drum sounds could make this easier.
This work was motivated by a desire to address an underex-
plored perspective in the NMP field, namely, that of the “jamming”
musician interested in generating material for use in indepen-
dently developed compositions. Over time, interest has grown in
embracing network latencies and disruptions as “crucial” char-
acteristics of the network medium worth embracing, for both
musical and social benefit [24, 29]. It is our hope that this work
inspires more developers and technologists to exploit latency as
13https://soniccharge.com/synplant
14https://michaelnorris.info/software/soundmagic-spectral
15https://akirarabelais.com/lyre/
a creative restriction, and to consider quasi-real time interaction
as an ideation exercise for asynchronous composition practices.
7 Ethical Standards
This paper complies with NIME ethical standards [34]. Work on
the software project whose implementation formed the basis of
this system was funded by a grant from NetEase in Summer 2022.
The system described here is not supported by any endorsement,
and was carried out in pursuit of the first author’s M.S. degree
from Carnegie Mellon University, without additional project-
specific funding from any source. All involved participants during
test sessions provided informed consent.
