ABSTRACT
The exploration of musical robots has been an area of in-
terest due to the timbral and mechanical advantages they
oﬀer for music generation and performance. However, one
of the greatest challenges in mechatronic music is to en-
able these robots to deliver a nuanced and expressive per-
formance. This depends on their capability to integrate dy-
namics, articulation, and a variety of ornamental techniques
while playing a given musical passage.
In this paper we introduce a robot arm pitch shifter for a
mechatronic monochord prototype. This is a fast, precise,
and mechanically quiet system that enables sliding tech-
niques during musical performance. We discuss the design
and construction process, as well as the system’s advantages
and restrictions. We also review the quantitative evaluation
process used to assess if the instrument meets the design
requirements. This process reveals how the pitch shifter
outperforms existing conﬁgurations, and potential areas of
improvement for future work.

1. INTRODUCTION
As technology evolves and we ﬁnd an increasingly wide ar-
ray of creative tools at our disposal, we have found exciting
ways to explore hardware and software through art and mu-
sic. In mechatronic music, we seek to use musical robots to
enhance human creativity and expression.
Mechatronic chordophones are musical instruments that
use strings as a sound source and integrate mechanical parts,
actuators, and electronics. This gives them an ability to ma-
nipulate parameters such as pitch, volume, and timbre with
levels of precision and control beyond that of human per-
formers. However, their musical capabilities are determined
by their subsystems’ strengths and limitations.

Figure 1: Protochord, a mechatronic monochord
In this paper, we propose a new pitch shifting mechanism
for Protochord (Fig. 1), a monochord prototype created as
a proof-of-concept to develop a new and improved multi-
string chordophone. It is designed to be a compact and
mechanically quiet device, and features a revolving picking
mechanism capable of performing high-speed plucking and
dynamic variations [20]. Throughout this work, the explicit
use of the terms “expressive” and “expressivity” refer to an
instrument’s potential to oﬀer a wide array of parametric
aﬀordances to enhance a musical performance.
Our objective is for the proposed pitch shifter mechanism
to exceed other existing system’s capabilities, while addre ss-
ing known challenges and restrictions. Therefore, it should
be:
• Capable of performing pitch-based expressive tech-
niques, including slides, pitch bends, and vibrato.
• A mechanically fast subsystem. It should minimise
mechanical latency to enable quick pitch changes.
• Precise and accurate. It should be able to perform
musical passages with adequate intonation (the diﬀer-
ence between the played pitch and the intended pitch
should not be larger than 6 cents [9]).
• A mechanically quiet instrument, generating acoustic
noise levels under 60 dB.
2. BACKGROUND
In this section, we take a closer look at mechatronic chordo-
phones by establishing a historical background, discussing
plucked string mechatronic chordophones, and reviewing
design approaches for pitch shifting and damping mecha-
nisms.

2.1 Historical Background
There is a long history of automated mechanical musical
instruments that have been developed for human interac-
tion as well as automatons. For example, a water organ was
built by the Ban¯ u M¯ us¯ a brothers during the 9th century [2].
Additionally, Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven were
known for their work composing for self-playing organs be-
tween the 18th and 19th centuries [3]. This was followed by
the emergence of music for orchestrions and pneumatically
operated instruments around the Industrial Revolution [14].
Although many of the mechatronic instruments that have
been built are percussion instruments, as well as robotic pi-
anos and idiophones, in recent decades there has been a
considerable amount of work in mechatronic chordophones.
Mechatronic artists have integrated these instruments into
their performances and sound art installations. An example
of this are Trimpin’s robotic guitars in installations such as
Krautkontroland If VI Was IX [6]. Godfried Willem-Raes
has also explored bowed chordophones through the develop-
ment ofHurdy, Aeio, and Synchrochord [15]. Other impor-
tant chordophones are Nicolas Baginsky’s Aglaopheme [1]
and Eric Singer’s GuitarBot [16], which are discussed in
Section 2.2.
Although instruments such as the piano and the harp use
a large number of strings tuned to a speciﬁc pitch, mecha-
tronic chordophone designs have favoured using a small
number of strings, similarly to guitars, bass guitars, zithers,
and banjos. Using fewer strings is convenient for chordo-
phone design because it facilitates creating a compact in-
strument that can be tuned and calibrated quickly. Further-
more, these instruments are capable of obtaining multiple
pitches from a single string, which enhances their expressive
capabilities (discussed in detail in Section 2.3).
Mechatronic chordophones may agitate a string in many
ways, such as rubbing it with a bow, striking it with a ham-
mer, or strumming multiple strings at the same time. How-
ever, this paper focuses on plucked string systems, consid-
ering thatProtochord and a majority of recent mechatronic
chordophones use this excitation method. The next sub-
section reviews how these devices are built and how they
work.
2.2 Plucked String Chordophones
Modern plucked string mechatronic chordophones may dif-
fer considerably in appearance, but in most cases, they are
easy to understand by comparing them to how guitars are
played. A guitarist performs using a picking hand to pluck
the strings, and a pitch shifting hand to press them. Sim-
ilarly, mechatronic chordophones have two main eﬀectors:
(1) a picking mechanism to agitate the string, usually with
an actuator or a pick; and (2) a pitch shifting mechanism to
apply pressure or clamp the string. Traditionally, dampers
have also been considered an independent eﬀector, however,
recent designs have integrated them into the pitch shifter (to
be discussed further in Section 2.4).
LEMUR’s GuitarBot (Fig. 2) [11], a self-playing guitar
built by Eric Singer, is an early system that uses a picker
and pitch shifter pair for each of its four string units. This
modular design has become a popular approach and it has
shaped recent chordophones such asMechBass and
Swivel 2 [12].
Baginsky’s Aglaopheme [1], another example of early gui-
tar robot, also incorporates a picker and pitch shifter, but
is designed to be performed as a slide guitar.
Having established that pitch shifters are an important
part of plucked string mechatronic chordophones, in the
following section we continue with various important ap-
proaches that have been implemented to develop expressive

self-playing guitar

pitch shifting mechanisms.
2.3 Pitch Shifting Mechanisms
Pitch shifters do not only determine how a chordophone
operates, they also have a major impact on its sound, ex-
pressive capabilities, and the structure of its frame. In most
mechatronic chordophones, it is the pitch shifter’s ability to
keep up with the picker that determines if the instrument
can play rhythms accurately and precisely, without any un-
expected noises, and while playing the desired pitches. Fur-
thermore, the pitch shifter is the eﬀector that performs most
pitch related expressive gestures, which adds another layer
of complexity to its development.
So far, existing pitch shifter design approaches lie some-
where in between two extremes: (1) high-speed systems
with little to no latency, but with little expressive capa-
bilities, or (2) highly expressive systems which are slower
due to mechanical latency.
A popular pitch shifter approach incorporates arrays of
ﬁxed actuators over the strings. Each actuator is placed di-
rectly on top of a speciﬁc pitch, which enables the system to
operate with virtually no mechanical latency. The downside
to this conﬁguration is that it usually requires a large and
bulky frame, and a large number of actuators. The ﬁxed
actuators are also unable to execute expressive technqiues
such as slides or bends.
Figure 4: EMMI’s Poly-tangent Automatic multi-
Monochord (PAM) robotic string instrument
Examples of chordophones that use this type of pitch
shifter system are Crazy J [17], which places an assembly
of solenoids over a guitar; PAM (Polytangent Automatic
Multimonochord) (Fig. 4) [18], a monochord with a set of
perpendicular “fretting ﬁngers” ; and Compressorhead and
Z-Machines, mechatronic bands with humanoid “robot per-
formers” that integrate mechanisms with arrays of pneu-
matic tubes play the strings [5].
Another popular design consists of timing belts and pulley
systems to displace a clamping carriage along the string’s
length, as seen onMechBass (Fig. 5) [11]. This type of pitch

shifter can move while clamping the string, which enables
sliding expressive techniques. However, these are conﬁgu-
rations that display mechanical latency (while the carriage
changes position), and produce considerable noise levels (de-
tailed in Section 4.3).
This type of pitch shifting mechanism is found in Bass-
Bot [18], and OnePiece [7], which are relatively recent chor-
dophones. GuitarBot, mentioned in Section 2.2, uses a sim-
ilar conﬁguration, but with a moving bridge assembly that
clamps the string and moves on a ball bearing slide track [16].
Another interesting approach is observable in Swivel 2 ,
a modular slide guitar [13]. This system incorporates a
servomotor-driven clamping mechanism that uses a rod to
press the string. Although this is a considerably fast and
expressive conﬁguration, it is unable to adequately clamp
the string. A chop-stick arrangement is explored in [4], but
it only represents a slight improvement.
Figure 6: StrumBot, a multi-string chordophone
One last approach we discuss is the use of a robot arm
to displace a clamping carriage along the string. Much like
timing belt and pulley pitch shifters, these are expressive
systems that display latency. However, they oﬀer advan-
tages in space eﬃciency, speed, and mechanical noise (Sec-
tions 4.2 and 4.3). Chordophones that have incorporated
robot arm pitch shifters areServoSlide [10], a simple mono-
chord; and StrumBot (Fig. 6) [19], a fan-shaped strummed
multi-string chordophone. Considering that this is the pro-
posed approach forProtochord, we discuss these systems in
detail throughout Section 3.
Clamping mechanisms have become an important part
of recent pitch shifting mechanisms, often as belt-driven
carriages or robot arm end eﬀectors. Although early designs
such asMechBass’ clamper were restricted to clutching the
string [11], new designs like StrumBot’s [19] and OnePiece’s
(Fig. 7) [7] have become more expressive, and they have
integrated the damping mechanisms. We take a closer look
at various damping mechanisms in the following subsection.

grates a damper attachment into its fretting disk

2.4 Damping Mechanisms
Damping mechanisms play an important role in mecha-
tronic chordophones. If a string is plucked, it will continue
ringing until it decays naturally or until it is muted de-
liberately. Incorporating a mechanism to damp the string
vibrations enables the chordophone to “perform” rests, as
well as articulations such as staccato and staccatissimo.
Incorporating damping mechanisms has been common
practice since early chordophone designs. Aglaopheme and
GuitarBot use solenoid-based dampers [1, 16], while Mech-
Bass and Swivel 2 use servomotors instead (Fig 8) [11, 13].
As mentioned in Section 2.3, the use of clamping mecha-
nisms in timing belt or robot arm systems has facilitated the
integration of damping mechanisms into the clamper. This
is done by forgoing the independent damper and adding
supporting attachments and soft materials to the clamp-
ing system. This innovation enables pressing and muting
the string with the clamper, which is space eﬃcient and re-
quires fewer actuators. Examples of these mechanisms are
found inStrumBot (Fig. 9) [19] and OnePiece (Fig. 7) [7].
We have reviewed the existing literature in plucked mecha-
tronic chordophones and pitch shifting mechanisms. The
following sections discussProtochord and the implemented
approaches to build a fast and expressive pitch shifter.
3. ROBOT ARM PITCH SHIFTER
Considering the importance of pitch shifting mechanisms
in mechatronic chordophones, as reviewed in Section 2.3,
through this paper we propose a new robot arm pitch shifter,
which is one of the core systems being explored inProto-
chord (introduced in Section 1).
Protochord’s frame, as displayed in Fig. 10, is built around
two parallel Actobotics X-rail aluminium extrusions. The
ﬁrst is the main support, directly holding most components,
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020
311
Figure 10: Protochord’s frame uses two parallel alu-
minium rails its main support structures
including actuators, electronics, as well as custom-made
laser-cut acrylic and 3D printed parts. The second one acts
as a rail for the pitch shifter’s clamping carriage, which will
be discussed in detail in Section 3.2.
Protochord’s pitch shifter uses an articulated robot arm to
position a clamping carriage along the string at high speeds.
This system is similar to the ones implemented inServoSlide
and StrumBot (Section 2.3), favouring a compact design,
and enabling the performance of glissandos and microtonal
pitches, as mentioned in the design considerations in Sec-
tion 1.
In the following subsections, we review this pitch shifting
mechanism’s design through the robot arm and the clamp-
ing mechanism. We then review the electronics used to
interact and control the system.
3.1 Articulated Robot Arm
The robot arm is the primary component of the pitch shifter
and it is responsible for displacing the clamping mechanism
linearly across a string segment of approximately 45–50 cm.
It is made of two laser-cut acrylic pieces with a length of
24 cm, measured from the centre of each joint at both
ends. The articulations consist of 3 mm threaded shafts
and ﬂanged bearings to facilitate smooth rolling between
both arm segments.
In order to meet the design requirements (Section 1), the
robot arm requires an main actuator devised for precise con-
trol and high-speed communications. Therefore, we selected
aDynamixel MX-64T , a smart DC servomotor that oper-
ates between 10-14.8 V and draws up to 4.1 A. Furthermore,
it oﬀers useful data feedback and control functions for pa-
rameters such as position, speed, temperature, and torque.
There are certain considerations to be taken into account
when implementing this conﬁguration. First, the displace-
ment of the carriage as the arm extends is not uniform,
which results in variable precision levels at diﬀerent points
of the string. Secondly, it is important to avoid reaching
positions of kinematic singularity at both ends of the mo-
tion range. At these points, the joints are fully extended or
contracted, which might result in conﬁguration shifts that
could block or damage the pitch shifter. This is addressed
by limiting the arm’s extent via software by setting the ser-
vomotor’s limits, or with supporting hardware such as limit
switches. Related ﬁndings are discussed in Section 5.
3.2 Clamping Mechanism
The clamping mechanism (Fig. 11) is directly responsible
for pressing the string to produce the desired pitches, and
it consists of two main components: (1) a clamping carriage,
and (2) a fretting attachment. The robot arm displaces the
clamping carriage until it reaches the selected position, and
the fretting attachment rotates to clamp the string.
In order to minimise mechanical latency, the design re-
quires a clamping carriage capable of smooth linear motion.
To achieve this, we designed an assembly usingActobotics
Figure 11: Protochord’s clamping mechanism con-
sists of a clamping carriage and fretting attachment
X-Rail Roller Brackets, two V-Wheel Kits , and a pair of 3D
printed brackets. The resulting carriage is capable of mov-
ing seamlessly across the top aluminium rail while holding
a servomotor.
As discussed in Section 2.4, integrating the damper into
the pitch shifter mechanism is a space eﬃcient approach.
This is why, similarly toStrumBot and OnePiece, Proto-
chord’s clamping mechanism is also its damper. Addition-
ally, this component has to meet the expressivity require-
ments mentioned in Section 1 by facilitating sliding tech-
niques and continuous motion. Therefore, the 3D printed
fretting attachment holds two rotating aluminium lugs, held
by press-ﬁt bearings to minimise friction. One of the lugs
works as the damper and is covered by a soft sleeve.
This conﬁguration enables the clamping mechanism to ro-
tate in order to perform three actions: (1) press the string
with the bare lug to produce notes, (2) use the damping lug
to mute the string, and (3) disengage the string to allow
playing open string notes. Moreover, using a single fretting
lug makes it easier to slide while applying pressure to the
string, as opposed to clamping mechanisms such asStrum-
Bot’s, which clasp the string between a pair of fretting rods.
Driving this clamper design requires an actuator capable
of exerting enough force over the string to produce clean
sounding notes. It should also oﬀer a rotation range wide
enough to perform the three actions mentioned in the previ-
ous paragraph. We determined that theMKS DS95i Micro
Tail Rotor Servo is a good ﬁt. This servomotor is con-
trolled via a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal, has an
operating voltage of 4.8-6.0 V, and a stall torque of 1.92-
2.40 kg-cm. Also, it oﬀers 60◦ of rotation, which is enough
for the fretting attachment to comfortably press, mute, or
release the string.
Exploring soft and ﬂexible materials to enhance expres-
sion or to damp mechanical vibrations has been an impor-
tant part of our research throughProtochord. The damp-
ing lug is evidence of this because its capability to mute
the string cleanly and immediately determines whether the
instrument can perform rests properly or not. Although
multiple options have been reviewed in Section 2.4, we de-
termined that using materials that resemble human skin
could oﬀer the beneﬁts of a natural sound when damping
the string, while avoiding buzzing and rattling noises.
In [8], Little used pourable silicone to design ﬂexible com-
ponents which display the desired properties. Inspired by
this, we manufactured the damping lug sleeve withSmooth-
On Mold Star 16 FAST Platinum Silicone Rubber . This
material makes it easy to fabricate ﬂexible components with
custom-made 3D printed molds.

An important consideration when working with chordo-
phones is that the behavior of the string is not uniform
across its length. For example, it is easier to bend the string
at the center than at its ends. On the other hand, at the
ends, smaller displacements will cause greater pitch varia-
tion than at the center. With the varying precision levels
from the robot arm (Section 3.1) added to this, this makes
system conﬁguration and calibration a critical step to main-
tain proper intonation.
Table 1 shows the lookup tables used to conﬁgure Proto-
chord and enable it to play notes that belong to the equal
tempered scale. The ﬁrst column displays the selected pitch
and frequency. The second column lists the Dynamixel po-
sitions that correspond to each note, using the servomotor’s
built-in position values, which we have limited to a range
of 1850–2500. Finally, the third column lists the clamping
servomotor’s PWM delay times applied at each position,
which correlate to the fretting attachment rotation.
3.3 Electronics
Figure 12: Protochord’s PCB assembly
Protochord’s custom-designed PCB assembly (Fig. 12) in-
tegrates a microcontroller, the actuator circuitry, and power
supply inputs. The system requires a microcontroller capa-
ble of driving multiple actuators simultaneously, at high
communication speeds, and with 5 V tolerant inputs. The
Teensy 3.5microcontroller ﬁts this proﬁle, with a large
number of I/O pins, four interval timers, and by making
it easy to work with TTL serial communications.
A SN74LS241N Tri-State Buﬀer is required to handle
TTL communications between the microcontroller and the
robot arm’s Dynamixel MX-64T servomotor. However, a
SparkFun Bi-Directional Logic Level Converteris also needed
to handle the voltage diﬀerence between the Teensy’s 3.3 V
output pin and the MX-64T’s data line, which operates at
5 V TTL level. The MX-64T itself is powered by the 12 V
input.
The DS95i clamping servomotor is controlled with a PWM
signal directly from a microcontroller pin, but is powered
from the 5 V input.
Note that the board also holds a pair of DRV8825 Step-
per Motor Drivers to control the picking mechanism’s ac-

4. EV ALU A TION
This section discusses the process we used to evaluate the
pitch shifter mechanism during performance, according to
the design requirements from Section 1. The evaluation
involved three distinct stages: (1) pitch shifting, (2) speed,
and (3) mechanical noise.
4.1 Pitch Shifting
Assessing the chordophone’s pitch shifting capabilities is im-
portant because it determines its ability to play the desired
notes and to play in tune. As mentioned in Section 1, our
objective is to keep the resulting pitches within 6 cents of
the target note.
We observed Protochord while playing three types of mu-
sical content: (1) static notes, (2) simple scale and melodi c
fragments, and (3) melodic fragments with repeated notes.
We determined that the pitch shifter is capable of playing
the target notes accurately, and repeated notes precisely,
with a maximum pitch deviation of 3–4 cents. This high-
lights the importance of using an actuator such as the Dy-
namixel smart servomotor, which made it possible to cali-
brate the chordophone using the lookup tables displayed in
Table 1.
Furthermore, throughout these tests we added variations
in the clamping behavior to perform expressively. As ex-
pected, the pitch shifter enables: (1) clamping while moving
to perform a glissando, (2) increasing the clamping rotation
to play a pitch bend, and (3) modulating the clamping pres-
sure to execute a vibrato.
An important consideration is that at higher speeds, and
when performing large position changes, we noticed a slight
recoil caused by the carriage overshooting the target posi-
tion. In Section 5 we discuss how to address this to avoid
intonation issues.
4.2 Speed
Although there is no standard method to characterise pitch
shifter speeds in diﬀerent chordophone designs, it is possible
to compare them to previous studies such as [12, 19]. We
measure the displacement time for the carriage to travel a
distance that results in a pitch an octave away from the
original position.
Table 2 shows the measured times achieved by each de-
vice [16, 19, 12]. At a maximum speed of 227 ms, Pro-
tochord outperformed GuitarBot, BassBot, and MechBass.
Although it was unable to match Swivel 2 and StrumBot’s
speeds, the system compensates for this with the perfor-
mance and expressive advantages it oﬀers. The Dynamixel
servomotor enables driving the pitch shifter at higher speeds,
however, the articulated arm and robot’s frame were unable
to withstand the resulting stress. We discuss this further in
Section 5.

4.3 Mechanical Noise
Assessing the levels of resulting acoustic noise is important
to determine if the system is capable of minimising extrane-
ous sounds that may interfere with the musical performance.
Existing literature has considered 60 dB to be a desirable
threshold, corresponding to the noise levels usually found
in a small public venue [19, 12].
We reproduce noise tests as detailed in [19]. Using a
Tenma 72-942 sound level meter, we measure the noise levels
at 0.5 m, which are then converted to 1 m standardised
reading.
Figure 13: Acoustic noise ranges per chordophone
Fig. 13 shows the minimum and maximum noise levels
per chordophone (with an accuracy range of ± 1. 4 dB), as
measured in [19], along with Protochord’s results. Proto-
chord’s noise levels at low to medium pitch shifter speeds
were the lowest at 40.8 dBA, however, higher speeds could
reach 60.6 dBA. Although the maximum level is still close
to the target 60 dB, it is still louder thanStrumBot. We ob-
served that this noise occurs because of frame design weak-
nesses, which are discussed in Section 5.
The evaluation tests highlight that Protochord mostly
meets the design requirements. It is an expressive and agile
instrument, capable of accurate and precise pitch shifting
while minimising extraneous mechanical noise.
5. FUTURE WORK
Although we have successfully designed a compact frame for
Protochord, throughout this paper we have identiﬁed mul-
tiple issues that can be attributed to structural weaknesses.
Driving the pitch shifter at higher speeds caused increased
acoustic noise, robot arm recoil, and structural damage to
joints and custom-made parts.
We address these issues in a multi-string version of Proto-
chord with a sturdier frame, currently under construction.
This new design includes reinforced arm and clamper car-
riage designs, as well as frictionless joints. Furthermore, we
reverse the orientation of the robot arm to improve into-
nation and to highlight notes in the lower register of the
chordophone.
6. CONCLUSIONS
We have presented a new pitch shifter mechanism for ex-
pressive mechatronic chordophones. This system integrates
a robot arm and clamping carriage and is designed to be
fast, accurate, precise, and mechanically quiet. This de-
sign outperforms most existing pitch shifters while enabling
expressive techniques such as slides and pitch bends.
