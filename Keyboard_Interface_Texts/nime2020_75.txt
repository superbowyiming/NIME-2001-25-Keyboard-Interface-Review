ABSTRACT
There are many studies of Digital Musical Instrument (DMI)
design, but there is little research on the cross-cultural co-
creation of DMIs drawing on traditional musical instru-
ments. We present a study of cross-cultural co-creation in-
spired by the Duxianqin — a traditional Chinese Jing ethnic
minority single stringed musical instrument. We report on
how we structured the co-creation with European and Chi-
nese participants ranging from DMI designers to composers
and performers. We discuss how we identiﬁed the ‘essence’
of the Duxianqin and used this to drive co-creation of three
Duxianqin reimagined through digital technologies. Music
was specially composed for these reimagined Duxianqin and
performed in public as the culmination of the design pro-
cess. We reﬂect on our co-creation process and how others
could use such an approach to identify the essence of tradi-
tional instruments and reimagine them in the digital age.

1. INTRODUCTION
Research on New Interfaces for Music Expression has ﬂour-
ished in recent years [3]. Whilst most of this work hap-
pens in academic research centers situated within a West-
ern musical aesthetic, some research has explored music
and music making from other traditions, combining ethnic
music elements into Digital Music Instrument (DMI) de-
sign such as Barbosa’s collaborations with musicians from
the Brazilian Northeast [1]. Similarly, Kapur describes the
creation of new interfaces that extend traditional Korean
music and dance, resulting in the design of the eHaegum
(Korean bowed instrument), eJanggu (Korean drum), and
ZiOm wearable interfaces [5]. Connon presents a new ex-
pressive electronic music controller based on the Irish Uil-
leann Pipes, a 7-note polyphonic reeded woodwind [4], and
Young presents a prototype of a new musical interface for
Japanese drumming [11].

However, there is very little research on the cultural col-
lisions in co-designing DMIs across cultures. In this paper
we reﬂect on a co-creation workshop we undertook in China
bringing together participants from China and Europe with
backgrounds in musicology, performance, composition, dig-
ital technology, and interactive design to explore the digi-
tal reimagining of the Duxianqin — a traditional minority
musical instrument of southwest China. As cross-cultural
co-creation of DMIs is underexplored in NIME we asked the
following research questions:
RQ1: How to engage participants from a range of cul-
tures and disciplines together in co-creation of DMIs
inspired by a traditional music instrument?
RQ2: What is the ‘essence’ of the traditional Duxi-
anqin that must be retained in reimagining through
digital technologies?
1.1 Digitally Reimagining
Many traditional instruments, their performance practice,
and cultural context are being lost as a result of socioeco-
nomic changes across the world [6]. As well as taking steps
to preserve and reinvigorate traditional cultural heritage we
can use digital technologies to reimagine elements of tra-
ditional cultural heritage to raise their public proﬁle and
expose them to new audiences. We refer to the creation of
new DMIs inspired by traditional instruments and the aug-
mentation of traditional musical instruments asreimagining
those instruments through digital technology. The key as-
pect of thisreimagining is that the essence of the traditional
instrument is retained somehow whilst being presented in
a novel way or with new features added to an existing in-
strument. Importantly, there should be a recognizable link
between features of the reimagined instrument and the tra-
ditional instrument. Byessence here we refer to the charac-
teristics which diﬀerentiate it from other instruments: the
sound produced; how sound is produced; the playing tech-
nique; and cultural context of the instrument.
In the rest of this paper we introduce the Duxianqin, fol-
lowed by our approach to cross-cultural co-creation. We
then report on our workshop in China and the three reimag-
ined Duxianqin that were produced. We reﬂect on the de-
sign process through observations, interviews, and question-
naires, and conclude with reﬂections on the ﬁndings and
suggestions for those attempting such an endeavor.
2. THE DUXIANQIN
In our research we aim to explore how to engage DMI de-
signers with musical traditions beyond their conventional
and cultural experience. The Duxianqin was selected as the
topic of our workshop as it is an unusual musical instru-
ment which features a single string that is plucked to pro-
duce harmonics whose pitch can be modiﬁed by the player,

and we were interested to explore how it could be adapted
to contemporary music and digital technologies. Further-
more, the Duxianqin is one of the few traditional Chinese
musical instruments which has already had some electronic
modiﬁcation through the inclusion of a pick-up on most
contemporary Duxianqin (point 5 on Figure 1).
The Duxianqin has a long history. In the eighteenth year
of Tang Zhenyuan period (AD 802), the Pyu city-states
(present-day Burma) in South Asia provided the Tang Em-
peror (China) with musical composition and instruments
as a tribute, among which there was Duxianqin. The New
Book of Tang [10] records that “The one-stringed instru-
ment is made of mottled bamboo. There is no decoration
but an image of the head of Hui (a kind of poisonous snake
in ancient books) carved from wood on it.” The Duxian-
qin is traditionally made of a large bamboo tube (three feet
long and about four inches in diameter), with the opening
part facing downwards, and a thin and long bamboo strip
on the surface of the bamboo tube raised longitudinally as a
string. Nowadays the Duxianqin is a traditional musical in-
strument in southwestern Guangxi province, China, mainly
played by Jing ethnic minority people.
The Duxianqin is played by touching the harmonics point
of the string (point 2 on Figure 1) with the outer side of
the palm and plucking the string to generate an overtone.
The left-hand moves joystick (Chinese colloquial transla-
tion; point 1 on Figure 1) to adjust the string’s tension, thus
changing the pitch (approximately three intervals). The
shape of Duxianqin varies slightly in diﬀerent regions, but
the playing method is the same. Traditionally the Duxian-
qin would be played outside and is used to produce music
which is considered soft, romantic, and melancholy.

3. CO-CREA TION METHOD
Following previous cross-cultural co-creation practice [2] we
structured the co-creation into four parts based on a tra-
ditional Chinese literature composition method (起承转合)
followed by reﬂection.
起 起 起Q ˇ ı: Introducing/ starting (2 months): Start by
learning about each other . The workshop leaders led two
months of online pre-discussion and preparation work prior
to the workshop through WeChat1 as a way for Chinese and
European participants to learn about each other and their
cultures. This included discussing the feasibility of creative
ideas as well as practicalities and what kind of software,
hardware and equipment were required. On average the
discussions lasted one hour once per week.
承 承 承Ch´ eng: Following/ inheriting (1 day): Immer-
sion in the traditional culture of both Duxianqin and NIME.

Participants spent one day at the Juntianfang Traditional
Cultural Base of Guqin in Beijing. This was split into two
parts: i) exposure to traditional Chinese music making and
performance through the tradition of the Guqin; and ii)
hands-on exposure to both Duxianqin and DMI construc-
tion, playing technique, and culture. At the end of the day,
ideas for reimagination of the Duxianqin were brainstormed
by the whole team to inform the design going forward.
转 转 转Zhuˇ an: Changing/ transferring (3 days): Co-
creation and mutual inspiration to reimagine the Duxian-
qin together. The goal of this part was to narrow down the
scope of design ideas, further identify the ‘essence’ of the
Duxianqin to inform DMI design, and to enable perform-
ers and composers work together. Outcomes of this section
included: design concepts of reimagined Duxianqin; imple-
mentation of key parts of the design concepts; composition
of music to be performed by the reimagined Duxianqin.
合 合 合H´ e: Concluding/ combining (1 day): Reﬁnement
and production together concluded the workshop, culminat-
ing in public performance with the reimagined Duxianqin
where the shared goals of performance and innovation were
realised.
3.1 Post-W orkshop Evaluation
To capture participants’ response to our workshop we un-
dertook interviews and deployed a questionnaire of 24 ques-
tions, covering topics of: cultural exchange; reimagined mu-
sical instruments; the ﬁnal concert; and the overall impres-
sion of cross-cultural cooperation.
3.2 Participants
The authors built a team of 24 people (8 female, 16 male,
average age: 32 years) from the UK (8) and China (16),
whose expertise is summarised in Table 1. Participants vol-
unteered their time in response to email and social media
messages inviting participation. Participants included post-
graduate students, researchers, and new media artists. Aca-
demic backgrounds included media arts, mathematics, psy-
chology, musicology, music performance, industrial design,
musical instrument manufacturing, and interaction design.
4. OUTCOMES
The key outcomes of the project are: identiﬁcation of fea-
tures of the ‘essence’ of the Duxianqin; three prototype
reimagined Duxianqin; a public performance of reimagined
Duxianqin; and feedback on the co-creation process itself.

4.1 The Essence of the Duxianqin
In起(Qˇ ı) pre-workshop preparation we held interviews and
led group discussions on what the essence of the Duxianqin
is from the perspective of both expert and na¨ıve Duxian-
qin players. For the European participants we shipped a
Duxianqin to the UK to allow hands-on experience of the
instrument. Key elements of the essence of the Duxianqin
were identiﬁed in ranked order as:
1. Joystick: gesture control on joystick which can con-
trol the pitch and has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on perfor-
mance technique;
2. Timbre: the soft sound of the Duxianqin which is
produced by overtones and has special meaning in Chi-
nese culture;
3. Single string : a key physical feature and limitation
of the Duxianqin
4.2 Reimagined Duxianqin
In terms of reimagining the Duxianqin, we found that the
traditional Chinese performers were more inclined to retain
as many traditional Duxianqin features as possible — in-
deed, there are few musical instruments which rely solely
on overtone and pitch bending. In contrast, the new me-
dia artists (European and Chinese) and non-musicians were
more inclined to create new musical instruments with wider
pitch range, and the possibility of polyphony.
We asked players of minority musical instruments which
features of the Duxianqin they would like to improve —
the biggest improvement proposed was the ability to play
polyphonic music. Note that traditionally there was an
aesthetic preference for monophonic music in Chinese cul-
ture [7], but from the 20th century, the polyphonic music
system of Western music increased the Chinese interest in
polyphonic music. Further proposed improvements were:
i) easier to play; ii) more attractive to younger people; iii)
wider range of sound produced; iv) wider range of pitches
produced; v) louder/ clearer sound produced.
Three reimagined Duxianqin were designed and proto-
typed: Polyqin, Digiqin, and Octoqin. Each is described
below and key features are summarised in Table 2. Each
reimagined Duxianqin used Bela2 to provide real-time sound
sampling, sample playback, and pitch modiﬁcation.
4.2.1 P olyqin
Polyqin is an augmented Duxianqin that can play multiple
sounds simultaneously. The bela samples the output of a
traditional Duxianqin in realtime and can inﬁnitely sustain
up to 6 notes controlled by piezoelectric sensors attached
to the top of the Duxianqin as illustrated in Figure 2. Five
participants worked on the Polyqin. The location of the
sensors for triggering and ending sustained notes was deter-
mined in co-design with Duxianqin expert performers and
resulted in the emergence of an exaggerated gestural style
for operating the sustain during performance. In this way
the essence of the Duxianqin and its playing style is retained
completely, and the new feature of polyphony is added.

Figure 2: Polyqin
4.2.2 Digiqin
Digiqin retains the Duxianqin essence of joystick and tim-
ber, and replaces the single string with touch sensitive strips
(Figure 3) to trigger playback of individual sampled notes
by Bela to make the reimagined Duxianqin easier to play.
Copper tape strips were attached to a bamboo tube to con-
nect with the traditional materials of the Duxianqin, and
the selection of pitches and number of notes was co-designed
with expert Duxianqin performers with the musical scale
being selected as the Chinese pentatonic scale of宫(g¯ ong),
商(sh¯ ang),角(ju´ e),徵(zhˇ ı),羽(yˇ u) to allow the Digiqin to
perform Chinese traditional repertoire easily.
Figure 3: Digiqin
4.2.3 Octoqin
The Octoqin is a radical reimagining of the Duxianqin and
yet retains enough of the essence for it to function in ensem-
ble performance. The Octoqin is made from an Octopus-
shaped doll (see Figure 4), with six cloth pressure sensors
sewn inside six of the legs to map to the six overtone po-
sitions on the string of a traditional Duxianqin. When the
legs of the Octoqin are squeezed a recording of the note from
a traditional Duxianqin is played by Bela with strength of
squeeze mapped to volume. Movement of the Octoqin’s
head modiﬁes pitch of the note produced, much like the
joystick in the traditional Duxianqin.
4.3 Concert
The workshop culminated with a public concert at the Cen-
tral Conservatory of Music, Beijing. The goal of the con-
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020

cert was to showcase the features of the reimagined Duxian-
qin. The composers created special compositions to explore
the expressive potential of each reimagined instrument. All
pieces are works with Chinese traditional music style, based
on traditional composition techniques, incorporating a small
number of modernist and electronic music elements.
Figure 4: Octoqin
The ﬁrst piece, called Duxianqin and Piano , is an ensem-
ble of the traditional Duxianqin and piano to highlight the
characteristics of traditional Duxianqin and provide con-
trast for the reimagined instruments. The second piece is
calledThe River Islet Rosy Cloud Splendour with Digiqin
as the main instrument and the Polyqin using techniques of
conterpoint, imitation and inversion, to explore the tradi-
tional and reimagined instrument combinations.
The third piece, Octopus Dreaming , was an ensemble for
Polyqin, Digiqin and Octoqin. The ﬁrst part introduced the
Digiqin following the theme of repetition and change within
the pentatonic alternating scale to reach a climax. The
second part developed the Octoqin as the main instrument,
and ﬁnally the Polyqin as the enhanced instrument, with the
Digiqin and Octoqin re-enacting the theme. Emphasis was
placed on the overlay of traditional melody using polyphonic
layering of sounds and eﬀects, especially with the Polyqin.
The piece attempts to embody the personality of the three
instruments and emphasize the fusion of Octoqin as a sound
eﬀect instrument with Polyqin and Digiqin.
4.4 Feedback
After the ﬁnal performance we conducted 19 interviews (6
European participants interviewed face-to-face, and 13 Chi-
nese participants interviewed by video call) to collect feed-
back about the overall plan and structure of the workshop,
cultural exchange, reimagined musical instruments, the ﬁ-
nal concert and the overall impression of cross-cultural com-
munication and cooperation. Quotes are attributed anony-
mously to participants in Table 1 and participation followed
the Chinese institution’s ethics procedures.
4.4.1 Communication and Design Process
Unsurprisingly, nearly all participants felt that language
was the biggest obstacle in the entire co-creation process.
This is a common problem encountered in cross-cultural co-
creation activities [2] which we had attempted to mitigate
through the extended起(Qˇ ı) pre-workshop phase. Through-
out the process, there were always a few participants who
could play the role of translators scattered among various
groups, though this was reported to create additional strain
on multi-lingual participants.
All participants thought that the schedule was ‘quite tight’
(P2CN). We attempted to mitigate the short co-located
workshop time with two months of online preparatory work
using WeChat text message and video call. Ten Chinese
participants found WeChat convenient for their communi-
cation e.g. ‘The WeChat was useful for breaking the ice
in becoming aware of the other participants’ (P1CN). How-
ever, three Chinese participants believed that it was diﬃ-
cult to communicate in-depth in Wechat (C1CN), and ﬁve
European participants believed that WeChat communica-
tion was too ‘troublesome, messy and superﬁcial’ (P5UK).
Indeed, we found that information exchanged on WeChat
is often fragmented, and so the host must both lead the
discussions and summarize after each brainstorming which
reduces the eﬀectiveness of the exchange.
Participants commented that they thoroughly enjoyed the
cooperation with most people taking a multi-disciplinary
approach (P2UK) to ‘complement each other, promote each
other, work closely together, and have a fruitful results’
(P5CN). However, two European participants thought that
there were few mutual understandings, which made collabo-
ration beyond basic cultural opinions very hard and limited
the participation in co-creation (P1UK).
4.4.2 Culture and Digital T echnology Immersion
All participants felt that the 承 Ch´ eng cultural immersion
was ‘good’ and stated that the program was full of Chinese
cultural factors. However, nine people thought that the re-
lationship between the Duxianqin and traditional Chinese
culture was unclear (P2CN). In terms of cultural exchanges
between the two sides, the Chinese personnel felt that the
communication time was short and it was not easy to under-
stand each other’s culture (P8CN). The UK side felt that
they did not have enough information and time to under-
stand the Duxianqin culture in advance (P6UK).
Regarding digital technology, Chinese participants noted
their surprise at the sophisticated digital technology brough t
by UK participants, but felt that they could not fully learn
the digital technology (P4CN) despite several Chinese par-
ticipants having relevant technical skills, while the UK par-
ticipants believed that the Chinese personnel did not pro-
vide good technical assistance (P1UK). Three Chinese per-
formers reported that the new technology left them at a
complete loss despite the workshop using Pure Data which
several Chinese participants had experience of and which
is intended to be an accessible platform for digital music.
Indeed, the unevenness of the relationship is reﬂected in
the view that ‘The UK side is a bit like a mentor and ad-
venturer, who experiences the Chinese culture and makes
some new works; the Chinese side is a bit like a student and
traveller, who learns new digital technologies and witnessed
the birth of new works while sightseeing a part of Chinese
culture together with foreigners’ (P3CN).
4.4.3 V iews on the Reimagined Duxianqin
Polyqin: Chinese musicians reported that it retained the
traditional playing style and is easier for professional mu-
sicians to use than the other reimagined instruments — a
‘more practical musical instrument with more traditional
features retained’ (D2CN). However, it is a pity that other
functions discussion in the design sessions such as harmony,
discrete notes, key changes, and screen display, were not
realized. Three electronic music composers thought that
Polyqin was more like a built-in eﬀects unit on traditional
Duxianqin, but does not have the potential for creating
modern music pieces (C1CN).
Digiqin: Performers reported that the discrete key sound
from the bamboo tube solves the problem of too few over-

tone positions, which is of great signiﬁcance to the innova-
tion of the Duxianqin (D2CN) and composer noted that it
is practical for making music (C1CN, C4CN). P1UK noted
that ‘it is more like an instrument because it makes the per-
formance more precise and the score playing more control-
lable. However, due to time limits, it is severely constrained
in terms of subtlety and intimacy’.
Octoqin: Twelve participants reported that it is a cre-
ative, touchable, interesting, attractive, and novel instru -
ment. However, Chinese performers and composers reported
that ‘according to the deﬁnition of a musical instrument
used for performance, it can only be used as an instrument
for performing special eﬀects’ (D1CN). Foreign participant
P1UK noted that it is ‘more like a novel sound toy. It makes
some sound, but it lacks dexterity, subtlety and intimacy,
which is essential for a true instrument’. Duxianqin per-
formers and educators reported that ‘it can play a certain
role in Children’s musical enlightenment... school-age chil-
dren can learn vibrato or a certain range of pitches, with fun
added’ (D2CN) and a Chinese non-musician thought that it
is very cute and could be a good product for children, and
possibly good for use in music therapy.
4.4.4 V iews on the Musical P erformance
The UK and Chinese participants both reported that the
performance was ‘great, and exciting’, ‘I really enjoyed it,
and was surprised by the quality of the performance’ (P5UK),
and were honoured to be able to participate (P8CN). How-
ever, one UK participant commented that the music was
not experimental enough (P1UK), and similarly, one Chi-
nese composer reported that the digital instruments could
have been used more boldly (C2CN) as discuss below.
5. REFLECTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
As with other cross-cultural NIME researchers such as Bar-
bosa [1], we tried to engage participants in co-creation of
DMIs inspired by cross-cultural heritage. In contrast to [1],
we i) focused on co-creation in which traditional composers
and performers take part from the beginning; ii) undertook
initial cross-cultural work remotely; iii) tried to ﬁnd a bal-
ance in the co-creation between contributing cultures.
In this section, we reﬂect on our research questions in
light of our observations above, and suggest of how future
cross-cultural musical instrument co-creation might be ap-
proached based on our experience.
5.1 RQ1: How to Engage Participants
Our ﬁrst research question was how to engage participants
from a range of cultures and disciplines in co-creation.
5.1.1 Clear Goals and Constraints
Setting a public performance as the end goal (much like
[1] and [2]) provided a concrete end-point for participants
to aim towards and was reported as a positive outcome of
the workshop by participants. However, this also sets a
challenge for the composers who must compose for an in-
strument the does not yet exist. In our workshop the com-
posers were included in the co-creation activities to help
inform their composition process before the instruments
were completed, and also to inform the design of the in-
struments themselves e.g. informing what pitch range and
timbre should be used. This can lead to new design sugges-
tions, for example, one composer (C1CN) proposed using
the Digiqin as a controller to map more synthetic sounds
with Max. However, it can also lead to unbalanced col-
laboration in the early DMI build stages where composers
cannot contribute to the technical aspects and also are not
able to start composing as they do not know the nuanced
capabilities of the instruments being created.
As with other design methodologies [2], we found that
imposing narrow design constraints supported focused
design work, and in our case, supported co-creation as well
as cross-cultural cooperation. Selecting a speciﬁc musical
instrument to explore (Duxianqin) prior to any design work
provided concrete boundaries within which our diverse set
of participants could design. Our co-creation process could
have been improved by restricting the initial set of design
features tojust one or two design features per reimag-
ined instrument to focus the design work further.
5.1.2 Balancing Backgrounds
We found that balancing backgrounds was especially im-
portant for the stages of转(Zhuˇ an) and合(H´ e) as our par-
ticipants came from a wide range of backgrounds and dis-
ciplines — not only composers but also performers, tech-
nicians, non-musicians, even the composers had diﬀerent
backgrounds: traditional music composers, electronic mu-
sic composers, and experimental artists.
Firstly, the background of the composers and the style
of the ﬁnal performance needs to be carefully balanced.
The more experimental the form of music performance, the
higher the tolerance for error, the higher the improvisation
and interactivity, and the more innovative the control meth-
ods and mapping of musical instruments and the expression
of sound can be. In our case it was especially important to
maintain the Duxianqin’s gesture control methods. Whilst
the ﬁnal performance was reported by some participants
as too experimental, others reported that it was not ex-
perimental enough, which in part was due to the lack of
rehearsal time leading to a more conservative composition
and performance style.
Secondly, as with other design research [9], we found
that physical making was an inclusive co-creation activ-
ity which involved both European and Chinese participants
in contrast to the software development which was under-
taken solely by European participants and reported as diﬃ-
cult to engage with by Chinese participants. The workshop
would have been more inclusive if we had more provided
more opportunities for a range of physical computing mak-
ing such as combining simple circuits and software making
along with the advanced Bela and Pure Data work.
5.1.3 Managing Time and Distance
The short time constraint on the making process was frus-
trating for participants (P8CN). However, given the fea-
tures of the reimagined Duxianqin produced it is not clear
whether having, say 10 days instead of 5 days for the work-
shop would have produced more design features, or simply
more reﬁned versions of the designs. The challenge here is
whether the purpose of the workshop is to explore design
features and cross-cultural making, or whether it is to create
reﬁned and ﬁnessed interactive systems. We spent 2 months
using WeChat to build an initial relationship between par-
ticipants in Europe and China. This had mixed results and
although services such as WeChat can feel alien and diﬃ-
cult to use to European participants, we suggest that they
should be embraced as an integral part of contemporary
Chinese culture. We used these pre-workshop activities to
begin to identify the essence of the Duxianqin and help to
inform a concrete set of design constraints. This process
would have been improved by creating a shared repository3
of design ideas and critique prior to the workshop.

5.2 RQ2: The Essence of the Duxianqin
The aim of identifying the essence of traditional instruments
is to help us to innovate with DMI design whilst at the same
time respecting heritage and tradition. Our long term aim is
to develop a methodology for the reimagining of traditional
instruments using digital technology.
In general, we can separate an instrument into gesture
control interface, sound, ergonomics, and appearance [1].
The key essence of the Duxianqin was identiﬁed through
pre-workshop discussions and then validated in the承(Cheng)
cultural immersion day: joystick control for pitch modiﬁca-
tion; soft timbre through overtones; single string. Identify-
ing these features requiresinterviews with expert perform-
ers as domain experts , in conjunction with observations
and analysis of the physical instrument itself by designer
experts who are non-expert with the instrument. In this
way we capture the essence from cultural experts and also
from an analysis of the physical aﬀordances which may have
become tacit knowledge to experts. Through the workshop
we found that gesture control (joystick) was most impor-
tant element of the essence of Duxianqin, followed by sound
(timbre from the overtone), and ﬁnally appearance and er-
gonomics, resulting in us selecting the joystick and timbre
as core essence of the Duxianqin for our reimagining. It is
worth noting that the core essence of Duxianqin was iden-
tiﬁed as its sound and sound control, not how it looks.
The essence of the Duxianqin is essentially the boundary
of the DMI design — the closer we are to the traditional
essence, the smaller design space. The essence of Duxain-
qin was used to constrain the co-creation activities in our
workshop and are evident in each of the reimagined Duxian-
qin to diﬀerent extents. When we kept more of the essence
(e.g. the Polyqin) we could only augment the traditional in-
strument and add some requirements from traditional mu-
sicians. Conversely, when we subtract elements from the
essence (e.g. subtracting the single string — Digiqin), we
have enough design space to move away from the traditional
whilst still recognizing its essence. Indeed, when we remove
most of the Duxianqin essence (e.g. the Octoqin, which is
furthest from tradition) we are free to explore an open de-
sign space, but the result was considered unsuitable for use
on stage by professional musicians, though it had potential
to become a music therapy tool for children.
Our last question about the essence of Duxianqin is: Who
decides which elements of tradition are important?
In feedback we found two positions: i) Performers, who in-
put the gesture; and ii) audience who receive the output
(sound) cf. [8]. We found that all professional perform-
ers preferred to play the Polyqin because it was nearer to
traditional Duxianqin. The non-musicians liked to try dif-
ferent ways to perform and were more accepting of the other
reimagined Duxianqin. In contrast, the audience’s percep-
tion of what was ‘traditional’ was more holistic — not only
timbre and gesture of the instruments, but also the mu-
sic style, the stage layout, and the performers’ clothes con-
tributed to the sense of what was traditional.
6. CONCLUSION
In this paper we presented our approach to reimagining the
Duxianqin through digital technology. We undertook co-
creation activities remotely and co-located to identify the
‘essence’ of the Duxianqin and co-created three reimagined
Duxianqin. These reimagined Duxianqin captured some of
the essence of the Duxianqin, and were performed in public
with specially composed music.
In future activities we would impose a more constrained
design space and attempt to engage composers and per-
formers in more of the digital aspects of the making. The
cross-cultural collaboration would be improved by oﬀering
more chances for participants to experiment, and the pro-
vision of shared repositories for richer communication.
