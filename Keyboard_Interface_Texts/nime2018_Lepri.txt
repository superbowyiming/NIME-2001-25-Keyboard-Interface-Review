ABSTRACT
Obsolete and old technologies are often used in interactive
art and music performance. DIY practices such as hardware
hacking and circuit bending provide eﬀective methods to
the integration of old machines into new artistic inventions.
This paper presents the Cembalo Scrivano .1, an interactive
audio-visual installation based on an augmented typewriter.
Borrowing concepts from media archaeology studies, tangi-
ble interaction design and digital lutherie, we discuss how
investigations into the historical and cultural evolution of
a technology can suggest directions for the regeneration of
obsolete objects. The design approach outlined focuses on
the remediation of an old device and aims to evoke cultural
and physical properties associated to the source object.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the context of interactive art, the practice of re-inventing
and re-purposing existing objects and technologies is well
established. Design approaches inspired by Do-It-Yourself
(DIY) culture, circuit bending and hardware hacking often
provide powerful and compelling methods for the creation of
new artworks. The act of reviving obsolete objects is a key
notion within the practice of contemporary art. Duchamp’s
readymades, ordinary manufactured objects that the artist
selected and modiﬁed, represent a pivotal example of con-
sumer commodities creatively reused.
In media theory, the attempts to understand new and
emerging technologies by taking into account the history
and evolution of past new media is deﬁned as media ar-
chaeology [30]. These cultural studies focus on the critical
scrutiny of forgotten technologies, observing that new media
often renovate old interactive paradigms and communica-
tion techniques. Hertz and Parikka propose a methodology
for contemporary artistic practice introducing the concept

of zombie media : “a media that is not only out of use, but
resurrected to new uses, contexts and adaptations” [16].
The cultural scrutiny of technological development can be
particularly relevant while considering embodied interaction
design. As noted by Dalsgaard and Koefoed Hansen: “we
perceive and act in a world laden with meaning, and mean-
ing is constantly being enacted and renegotiated through
our interactions with each other and the world” [9]. There-
fore, embodied interactions are here conceived as meaning-
ful experiences arising from physical actions and practices.
Dourish conceives the relation between interaction, ob-
jects, and meaning as constructed through social and cul-
tural practice [11]. Thus, while designing a new object, it
is possible to elicit, augment or alter physical actions as-
sociated to existing objects, situations and environments.
Horn proposes an approach to tangible interaction design
concerned with the “overall experience around an interac-
tive artifact by cueing productive patterns of social activity”
[17]. Likewise, Norman introduces the notion of social sig-
niﬁers, which he deﬁnes as perceivable cues that suggest
social activity or appropriate social behaviour [29]. Hurti-
enne & Israel recognise the importance of cultural form in
their continuum of pre-existing knowledge (e.g. innate, sen-
sorimotor, cultural and domain expertise knowledges) [18].
The work here introduced focuses on the redesign of an
old device by evoking existing cultural and physical re-
sources associated to the source object. The device func-
tionalities were re-composed by exploiting shared knowl-
edge linked to the machine. Historical and cultural con-
siderations informed the re-assemblage of the device’s us-
age within a new interactive context. The result of this
design process is the Cembalo Scrivano .1 (CS1): an inter-
active audio-visual installation based on the renewal of an
old typewriter. The strategy adopted combines media ar-
chaeology studies with instrument design principles to elicit
speciﬁc cultural and musical notions. The public presenta-
tion of work allowed us to reﬂect on how a given object can
acquire new behaviours and identities while maintaining its
original aspect and functionalities.
This paper therefore presents the design of an interactive
experience whose ultimate goal is to serve aesthetic and
artistic functions. First, considerations related to media ar-
chaeology, instrument design and the re-use of everyday ob-
jects in artistic contexts will be introduced. Subsequently,
the main conceptual and technical features of the CS1 will
be illustrated. Finally, we will discuss some of the cultural
implications that can be drawn from the CS1 project.
2. SHAPING PAST-PRESENT MEDIA
The CS1 ideation and development have been inﬂuenced by
musical notions and DMI design principles [8]. A few con-
siderations on new musical interface development and media
studies might help to introduce the CS1 design process.

2.1 Instrument design and media archaeology
Notions such as corporeal intentionality and embodied in-
teraction are considered as core aspects of musical expres-
siveness [21]. From this viewpoint, designers of New Inter-
face for Musical Expression (NIME) inherit a centuries-old
body of knowledges and practices. New instruments are
often discussed in relation to traditional instruments [33,
19]. This suggests that historical and cultural practices are
easily projected into the design of the new instruments.
Far from being obsolete technologies, nowadays, tradi-
tional instruments steadily persist in contributing to most
of the musical contexts. On the other hand, a debate around
the longevity of the many DMIs presented at NIME is grad-
ually gaining attention [27]. The project here presented is
grounded on the idea that new media re-mediates old media
[3]. The design of a novel instrument can be approached as
a migration process in which features associated with exist-
ing musical technologies are integrated and negotiated into
a new context. Parikka writes “media archaeology sees me-
dia cultures as sedimented and layered, a fold of time and
materiality where the past might be suddenly discovered
anew, and new technologies grow obsolete increasingly fast”
[30, p.3].
NIME literature oﬀers diﬀerent examples on the prac-
tice of re-evaluating, reusing or adapting old and obsolete
musical technologies. While introducing his Phantastron
synthesiser, Parker oﬀers a comprehensive overview of pre-
vious musical research involved with the re-appropriation
of vintage technology [31]. In his book “Handmade Elec-
tronic Music: The Art of Hardware Hacking”, sound artist
and author Nicolas Collins provides a valuable introduc-
tion to hardware hacking and circuit bending for the perfor-
mance of electronic music [7]. Composer and contemporary
artist DeMarinis has extensively explored the practice of re-
inventing “orphaned technologies” with many sound instal-
lations [10]. Freed et al. question the idea of technological
development per se and they emphasise that DMI longevity
of use depends on a constant process of re-implementation
to maintain the required stability of performance of play-
ers [13]. However, even if many DIY musical subcultures
are engaged with the re-purposing of older technologies, on
the extent of our knowledges, only Parker discusses media
archaeology studies within the context of instrument design.
The research outlined is therefore concerned with the
practical application of ideas coming from cultural studies.
Within the NIME context, this approach can be contextu-
alised around the notion of instrumentality. Instrumental-
ity refers to those features that determine the speciﬁcity of
a musical instrument as “distinguished from other sound-
producing devices” [4]. In his 1987 article entitled “Instru-
mentalities”, Burrows suggests that a musical instrument
is ultimately deﬁned by the intentions and purposes of the
person that interact with it [5]. Cance et al. presented an
interview study in which a number of experts had to give
their personal deﬁnitions of musical instrument [6]. As a
result, they argue that instrumentality is not so much de-
pendent on the properties of a device itself, but rather on
the actions and meanings that are embedded into it. Thus,
instrumentality seems to be a “dynamic concept that is not
tied to an object per se but is rather a matter of cultural
negotiation” [15].
2.2 Remediating everyday objects
Drawing on the works of McLuhan [24] and Bolter and
Grusin [3] remediation can be deﬁned as the formal logic
by which new media refashion prior media forms. This im-
plies that characteristics typical of an existing media are
transferred into the new media. Digital media often reme-
diate analog media, for instance the pages of a web portal
might remediate those of a printed newspaper. Nowadays,
thanks to low-cost microcontrollers and embedded systems,
everyday objects can be easily digitalised in order to expand
their functionalities and remediate of other devices.
DIY and musical practices often imply the migration of
speciﬁc functionalities and purposes amongst diﬀerent tech-
nologies. A pioneering work is Imaginary landscape no. 4
for twelve radios by John Cage: from radio to musical in-
strument. NIME literature oﬀers various examples linked
to the remediation of music technologies using everyday ob-
jects. The Peripipe is a tangible remote control for a music
player in the shape of a wooden tobacco pipe [12]. The
Wheel Quintet is a novel musical instrument comprising
four bicycle wheels and a skateboard [22]. Rasamimanana
et al. presented an ensemble of tangible devices and soft-
ware modules designed for musical interaction and perfor-
mance [32]. One goal of the project was to let users assem-
ble the wireless interfaces with everyday objects favouring
the customization of the various items’ musical functions.
Digital commodities such as laptop computers and mobile
phones have been often co-opted to remediate musical in-
struments, amongst others the Laptop Accordion [25] and
the Smule Ocarina [35].
Keyboard devices have been explored to support music
production and performance. Live Writing is interactive
performance in which the process of typing a poem is cap-
tured and augmented to create audiovisual elements. The
idea behind the performance is to establish natural links
among the components of typing gestures, the poem being
written and audiovisual artefacts [20]. Nash augmented a
computer keyboard to capture velocity and other continu-
ous musical properties, in order to enhance expressive inter-
action with music software [28]. Armitage and McPherson
explored alternatives to the QWERTY keyboard as physical
interface to laptop live coding by augmenting a stenotype
keyboard which permits continuous gestural control of keys
[2]. The typewriter has been used in many artistic con-
texts, often as part of installations involving the coupling
of digital and analog technologies. 1 A Project from 1970
by Carl Fernbach-Flarsheim used a program called “Con-
ceptual Typewriter” to generate random spatial outputs of
letters and numbers. The typewriter installation “On Jour-
nalism #2 Typewriter” writes generatively constructed sto-
ries about journalist who have been killed worldwide since
1992 based on the existing data of their lives as well as their
published work.
It is possible to argue that typewriter and modern com-
puter often remediate each other. This link seems to be
present within the overall history of digital technology: JOSS,
one of the very ﬁrst interactive, time-sharing programming
languages developed in 1963, featured a typewriter as in-
put interface.2 On the other hand, nowadays it is possible
to buy conversion kits to use vintage typewriters as USB
keyboards for MAC and PC computers. 3

ing the user’s typing activity, the CS1 generates in real-
time audio and visual materials. The project is inspired by
the writing machine created in 1855 by the Italian inventor
Giuseppe Ravizza. Ravizza’s machine is considered a pre-
cursor of the later Sholes and Glidden Type-writer (the ﬁrst
commercially successful writing machine, invented in 1868).
In fact, the Cembalo Scrivano features noticeable similari-
ties with the Sholes and Glidden design. Giuseppe Ravizza
called his invention Cembalo Scrivano (Scribe Harpsichord)
due to the usage of piano-keys (see Figure 1). Ravizza’s in-
vention reworks the harpsichord interface: an existing mu-
sical instrument was used as source of inspiration for the
development of a new machine (from art technology to type-
writing). The CS1 aims to mirror this process: a typewriter
is converted into an interactive art installation (from type-
writing to art technology). Oscillating between two domains
(musical and literary), the same technology travels across
history, carrying knowledge, behaviours and meanings.

Giuseppe Ravizza in 1855. Picture retrieved

3.1 Design approach: reverse the analogy
Ravizza borrowed the Harpsichord’s interactive paradigm
for the implementation of his machine: by pressing the keys,
instead of playing notes, it prints symbols. The idea behind
the CS1 is to adopt the same design approach but estab-
lishing the inverse analogy.
Starting from the interaction paradigm of the typewriter,
we develop an interactive system that could be used in the
context of interactive sound and visual art. Both machines
share features with the technologies to which they refer.
For instance, both the Cembalo Scrivano and the harpsi-
chord produce speciﬁc punctual events (letters and notes)
by pressing the keys with the ﬁngers. Likewise, the CS1 and
the typewriter are based on the same principle: in order to
modify the internal state of the system and its output it is
necessary to convey physical energy to the object through
ﬁngering activity. Rather, the ﬁnal goals of the interaction
have been re-established and shifted into a new domain.
The CS1 design approach can be contextualised within
the discussion on interpretation in Human-Computer Inter-
action (HCI) introduced by Sengers and Gaver [34]. In
particular the CS1 aims to support multiple interpretations
exploiting two speciﬁc design strategies presented by Sen-
gers and Gaver. The ﬁrst refers to the intention of clearly
outlining usability (typing activity), while leaving the au-
dience free to interpret the sonic and visual materials gen-
erated. The second concerns the idea of stimulating new
interpretations by purposefully blocking expected ones (i.e.
the produced elements are not those normally associated
with the use of a typewriter).
The CS1 aims to combine physical and digital realities,
conceiving the two dimensions as linked within a contin-
uum [26]. Typing on a standard typewriter causes both
the production of a sound (mechanical motions of the keys)
and the impression of a symbol on the paper. The CS1 is
conceived to synthesise in the digital domain analogous vi-
sual and sonic elements (animated letters and mechanical
sounds). The presence of similar interactive feedback cre-
ates a link between the behaviours associated to the original
object and the new outputs introduced. On the other hand,
as distorted reﬂections, the sounds and symbols generated
do not exactly behave as they do with the original object.
The user is therefore exposed to an ambiguous situation
in which the behaviours generated do not match any more
with those normally associated to a typewriter. As Ravizza
did with his Cembalo Scrivano shifting from musical notes
to letters, the idea is to alter the outcomes of the interaction:
symbols becomes abstract shapes and sounds diverge from
the resonances acting within the writing mechanism.
These design strategies can be linked to the work on am-
biguity as a resource for design introduced by Gaver et al.
[14]. Here, ambiguity arises in the way that information
is presented (i.e. altered and aleatory). In addition, the
tension that might emerge while presenting a typewriter in
art gallery environment, should contribute to interpret the
object in unexpected ways. Gaver et al. refer to this as
“ambiguity of context” presenting the pivotal example of
the Duchamp’s Fountain.
From a more general viewpoint, the design approach here
introduced is also concerned with fundamental social and
environmental issue. Waste of electronic equipment is one
the fastest growing waste streams. In the EU, 9 million
tonnes of electrical waste were generated in 2005, and ex-
pected to grow to more than 12 million tonnes by 2020. 4
As noted by Parker “antiquated technology is in the com-
mon domain and ready to be utilised in the synthesis of new
ideas” [31]. Since in the history of technology, patterns of
interaction and communication often revive and recirculate,
media archaeology studies are keen to see the distinction
between new and past media as blurred [30]. Indeed, in
the Western world, through the combination of consumerist
trends and technological innovations “new media always be-
comes old” [16]. In a society in which technology assumes
a predominant role in almost every aspect of our life, occa-
sionally it seems natural to wonder if technology is at the
service of humanity or vice versa. The CS1 design approach
aims to question the need of new technology and it proposes
a reversed solution that aims to re-discover the past in or-
der to imaging the future. The notion of new (intended
as better, more powerful and eﬃcient) might be sometimes
replaced by concepts such as reinterpreted, reused and re-
generated.
3.2 System architecture: a look inside
The typewriter used in the project is an Olympia SM9 (Fig-
ure 2). The typewriter was distributed with a custom suit-
case for transport. The CS1 interactions are based on the
detection of the keys pressed by the user. Each key is con-
nected to a metal bar that passes through the bottom of
the machine. Once a key is pressed the bar slides down

Figure 2: From left to right: the Olympia SM9 typewriter used in the CS1; the sensing mechanism - by
pressing a key (blue) the metal bars touch the potentiometer (yellow) in a speciﬁc point; the Olympia SM9
suitcase base equipped with Arduino, sensors and LEDs
(a few centimetres). In order to detect this movement, we
used a membrane potentiometer placed under the machine.
The sensor was placed on the base of the typewriter suit-
case. By shifting down, the various bars touch the sensor
in diﬀerent points. In this way, it was possible to assign a
speciﬁc position-region of the sensor to a speciﬁc symbol of
the keyboard. This procedure is the basis of all the new
interactive elements developed.
The energy detected by the sensor is converted into dig-
ital information using the Arduino Uno board. First, the
data are processed in order to: (i) associate the membrane
values to speciﬁc ASCII values, (ii) control the behaviour of
eight LEDs placed within the typewriter (see Section 3.3).
After these processes, the detected ASCII values are sent to
a computer and processed using Max-MSP and Processing.
The communication between the various hardware and soft-
ware units is based on serial port (Arduino to Processing)
and OSC (Processing to Max-MSP).
3.3 Introducing the digital dimension
From an interactive viewpoint, the CS1 is characterised by
two states. The machine state changes only if the user
presses the keys. The ﬁrst state is associated to a condi-
tion of quietness. If the keyboard is not touched (no let-
ters are typed for more than ten seconds) a constant low
frequency drone like sound is generated. Simultaneously,
LEDs located on the bottom of the machine (see Figure 2)
constantly fade in and out. Besides the slow and constant
LED fades, during the quietness state, no visual feedback is
generated.
If a key is pressed, the CS1 switches to the second state.
The LED behaviour immediately changes: from slow and
dimmed to impulsive and bright: LEDs turn on only for the
time a key is pressed. The drone sound shifts to a higher fre-
quency and decreases in amplitude. Once a key is pressed,
additional sounds are added; pre-recorded and manipulated
samples of the machine itself. This sonic material is char-
acterised by an impulsive envelope with a sort of glitchy
and ﬂickering decay. The pressed key is also visually gen-
erated (see Figure 3). The letter is randomly located on
the screen and it lands to its ﬁnal position by moving with
diﬀerent behaviours. The juxtaposition of the various trails
contributes to the generation of abstract shapes. While in-
teracting with the CS1, it is increasingly diﬃcult to keep
track of the various typed letters. Additionally, the ways
the letters appear is characterised by fast oscillations and
shakes. This aim to establishes a direct connection between
the generated visual and sonic behaviours (shaking letters
and glitchy sounds).
The attempt is to implement interactions characterised
by constrained behaviours aﬀected by stochastic processes
[23]. Consequently, at any new iteration of the same action,
it is possible to generate a new variations of the same kind
of conduct. It is possible to view a short demo of the CS1
at this link. 5
3.4 CS1 set-up
The CS1 is conceived for intimate and silent spaces. This
to evoke a deep and almost meditative writing activity: a
quiet, private and focused practice. The CS1 should be
therefore set up isolated within a small-sized room, in which
the audience can interact with the machine individually or
as a small group. Moreover, in order to appreciate the
changes of light occurring within the typewriter, the en-
vironment should be dimly lit.
Ideally, the generated images should be projected on a
wall behind the typewriter and the audio signal diﬀused
trough a stereo PA system. Alternatively, the video can
be displayed using a computer screen placed on top of the
typewriter and the sonic output can be listened to via head-
phones.
4. PUBLIC PRESENTATIONS
The CS1 was presented in two art exhibitions: CruftFest at
Queen Mary University of London and Dorkbot London at
The Boxing Club, Limehouse Town Hall. CruftFest is an-
nual mid-term showcase event in which students can present
and demo interactive projects developed during the ﬁrst half
of the year. Dorkbot London is periodic informal gathering
of artists, engineers, designers, scientists, inventors work-
ing under the umbrella of electronic art. At CruftFest, the
installation was set up in an acoustically isolated and dark-
ened room. The typewriter and the computer monitor were
placed on a table at the centre of the space, the two speakers
at two meters of distance on the back of the typewriter. At
Dorkbot London it was not possible to recreate the same
conditions: the CS1 was installed on a shared table in a
large hall where many other activities were simultaneously
happening. In both cases, the audience had the possibility
to freely interact with the machine: no instructions were
provided, though a verbal description of the work was given
on request. Approximately 40 people interacted with the
object. After trying the installation, the ﬁrst author had
the chance to discuss with some of the audience about their
experience with the CS1.

The CS1 was generally evaluated as playful and aesthet-
ically pleasant experience. In addition, we noted that the
audience usually approached the installation with good de-
gree of conﬁdence. Often, the fact of recognising a type-
writer immediately triggered those behaviour normally as-
sociated with the object (e.g. fast typing). The presence
of the machine functioned as strong incentive to participate
and get involved with the installation. We also noted that
a brief description of the work was usually requested by
the audience after a few minutes of interaction. Generally,
the ﬁrst drive was to directly try the installation without
seeking any speciﬁc information or instruction. Moreover,
the quiet modality activated when no user interacted with
the CS1 (constant drone sounds and slow LEDs fades), was
often acknowledged as a stimulus to start the interaction.
During public presentation, it was possible to observe
that the audience was engaged in questioning and nego-
tiating the usage of the CS1. Indeed, during the inter-
action, they gradually changed their attitude towards the
typewriter. This process has been conﬁrmed by the partici-
pants during the interviews. Initially, the general tendency
was to approach the CS1 as a normal typewriter, without
giving much attention to the visual and sonic feedback gen-
erated by the installation. Once they realised that the words
typed were not directly displayed on the computer monitor,
the users started to pay more attention to the system’s out-
puts. At this point, the audience started a more detailed
exploration of the sounds and images generated. After the
interaction, the audience comments on the nature of the
CS1 were quite diverse. Most of them agreed on the idea
that the CS1 is no longer a typewriter. Various partici-
pants interpreted the CS1 as a musical instrument. Some
of them even began to imagine a little ensemble made out
of typewriters.
The characteristics of the location in which the CS1 is
shown drastically inﬂuence the perception of the work. While
the isolated space available during CruftFest was ideal for
the experience, the shared hall at Dorkbot London did not
facilitate the fruition of the work. We noted that, the loca-
tion being dispersive rather than immersive, the audience
modalities of interaction were generally hasty and superﬁ-
cial. Indeed, compared to the CruftFest exhibition, only a
few people were able to pay attention to the audio-visual
interactions for a consistent amount of time.
The evaluation of designs inspired by media archaeology
studies remains an open topic. In particular, further in-
vestigations might help to better frame how meanings and
functions associated to existing objects can be re-designed
to promote participatory and engaging experiences.
5. DISCUSSION
This paper introduced the CS1: an augmented typewriter
that allows for the real-time generation and manipulation
of sonic and visual materials. The project, presented in
diﬀerent exhibitions, features the re-assemblage of an ob-
solete technology into an interactive installation. The de-
sign approach outlined focuses on the remediation of tan-
gible interactions inspired by considerations related to the
history of the object. The analogy with the work of the
Italian inventor Giuseppe Ravizza is the starting point for
the exploration of a tangible interaction that refers to well-
established cultural experiences (music practice and type-
writing) and it is associated with a deﬁned interactive pa-
radigm (key-pressure like interaction) [1].
By presenting the CS1 in diﬀerent venues it was possi-
ble to understand that the characteristics of the location
drastically inﬂuence the perception of the work. The audio-
Figure 3: A view of the visual output generated by
the CS1
visual interactions implemented are indeed based on slow
and subtle behaviours that require some minutes of interac-
tion to be fully perceived. We noticed that large, crowded
and dispersive spaces do not promote a focused and immer-
sive interactive experience. In order to properly appreciate
the installation a calm and silent environment is required.
While discussing various principles for the design of com-
puter music controller Perry Cook argues that “everyday
objects suggest amusing controllers” [8]. We believe that,
in addition to the playful dimension, everyday objects can
introduce powerful stimuli to promote the audience active
participation. In line with the arguments of Lind and Nyl´ en,
we think that everyday objects provide a means for “en-
abling people to master the instruments when they ﬁrst
encountered them, and hence participate” [22]. In our ex-
perience, the audience, while approaching the CS1 for the
ﬁrst time, tend to directly engage with the machine without
questioning the functioning and meanings of the installa-
tion. This has been perceived by the authors as a sponta-
neous and natural form of early participation.
During the interviews most audience members aﬃrmed
that the CS1 was gradually no longer perceived as a type-
writer. However, the feedback received on the new nature
of the CS1 were quite divergent. It therefore seems that
the identity of the CS1 dynamically varies in relation to
a subjective cultural negotiation. This can be considered
a positive result, in line with our attempt of designing an
engaging experience that could “suggest issues and perspec-
tives for consideration without imposing solutions” [14].
Bolter and Grusin argue that remediation “rehabilitates
other media” and it can be understood as “a process of re-
forming reality” [3, pp. 56]. The CS1 project suggests that,
in light of existing goals and expectations, it is possible to
alter the meanings and associations linked to an object by
reshaping the device functionalities and contexts. Given
the artistic nature of the project, the accountability of co-
existing meanings is considered by the authors as a power-
ful and stimulating feature [34]. The installation therefore
takes advantage of multiple interpretations in order to elicit
and support audience engagement.
In the case of the CS1, the shift from typewriting to dig-
ital art was realised by twisting the results of the interac-
332
tions normally associated to the source object. As proposed
by Horn, it is therefore possible to elicit new meanings and
functions by focusing is on “existing cognitive, physical, and
emotional resources” [17]. We suggest that investigations
into the historical and cultural evolution of a technology
might reveal hidden notions and archetypes. The explo-
ration of the paradigms and ideas that a speciﬁc device em-
bodied can be an eﬀective strategy for the re-imagination
and renewal of obsolete machines.
