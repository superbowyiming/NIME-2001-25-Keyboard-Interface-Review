Abstract
This paper outlines the development and use of NIME supporting
active audience participation within You’re an Instrument! , an
immersive childrens’ theatre show that turns a planted audience

gestural instruments in the show, exploring their novel use as
hidden props and theatrical devices that help invite audience
members into a fictional world. Through the creation of this
fictional world, we illustrate how Digital Musical Instruments can
be employed to build a narrative that may help to actively involve

1 Introduction
This paper outlines the use of a wireless gestural instrument,
the AirSticks, in a novel theatre production involving musical
interaction. We explore their novel use as hidden props and the-
atrical devices and as a tool to invite audience members into a
fictional world where they participate in active music-making
through storytelling. We discuss the development and key discov-
eries relating to this active audience participation in an immersive

childrens’ theatre show we created that revolves around a planted
audience member being turned into a musical instrument.
Building on immersive theatre disciplines, we make the fol-
lowing proposal in the field of instrument design: worldbuilding
and storytelling that involves the audience can provide a scaf-
folding that promotes more active audience participation and a
new relationship with Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs).
2 Background
We first look to the discipline of ‘immersive theatre, ’ as it is often
called, to investigate how other practitioners go about defining
and working with worldbuilding and storytelling that involves
the audience participation, and to explore crossovers in musical
disciplines.
The genre of immersive theatre has experienced a huge spike
of popularity in the past decade, with the advent of a wide variety
of theatre shows that espouse an intimate, choose-your-own
adventure experience of theatrical spectacle. This popularity is
in part due to Punchdrunk Theatre – a British theatre company
known for pioneering the immersive style of performance where
audiences interact with actors and explore elaborate set designs
in non-traditional spaces. In 2011, Punchdrunk premiered Sleep
No More [17], adapting Shakespeare’s Macbeth as a film noir
experience, allowing audiences to freely explore a multi-story
set, discovering scenes and characters in a nonlinear fashion. In
reality, this genre is a loosely defined and significantly broader
concept beyond what many refer to as ‘immersive theatre’ or
‘experience design. ’ As Burickson[5], the author of ‘Experience
Design: A Participatory Manifesto’ puts it:
...the term experience design has been finding its
way into the conversations of designers and artists
and makers in an unexpected array of disciplines.
It’s not always clear what people mean when they
use the term, but it’s often met with an ah ha! look
in their listeners. This is what I’ve been trying to
do, they seem to be thinking [5].
The field of human–computer interaction (HCI) has also re-
flected on this concept through what is known as a diegetic
interface, an interface that is integrated into the narrative or
environment of a virtual space, allowing the participant’s inter-
actions to occur within the context of the story itself [14].
Specific to these kinds of works is the notion of ‘immersion’
in artistic experiences. We investigate below why techniques
such as worldbuilding and storytelling that involves the audience
are employed in art forms like theatre where active audience
participation is used. Specifically, we will focus on three types of
immersion Burickson [5] proposes.
2.1 Types of immersion
2.1.1 Psychological immersion. In a participatory experience, the
narrative provides the clues or direction as to why an audience
member might participate or take a particular action.
Despite these being fictional scenarios, the storytelling con-
tributes to a shared knowledge within the experience that guides
the audience to participate in concrete ways. Reason and Heine-
meyer [20] call this kind of technique ‘storyknowing, ’ and they
have shown that storytelling workshops in diverse art forms have
encouraged participants to develop storyknowing and intrinsic
value through the process of inhabiting a story [20]. Of course,
literary fiction also serves to foster empathy and a kind of ex-
periential knowledge, enhancing people’s capacity to navigate
complex emotional landscapes [10].
Burickson [5] would call this type of immersion ‘psycholog-
ical immersion’ – being engaged in a personal manner as the
experience develops. This in turn allows for a richer experience,
as the audience personally relate to events that are occurring in
the experience.
2.1.2 Physical immersion. ‘Mise-en-scène’ is a term used in cin-
ema to describe all the worldbuilding elements found within the
frame of a shot. It literally means “placing on stage, ” down to the
smaller more subtle elements on a set like the colour of the walls
or the paraphernalia on a bookshelf.
In a traditional theatre show or concert, the mise-en-scène
could be said to be all the objects, props and theatrecraft that
makes up the world that the actors or performers inhabit. This
is often referred to as ‘environmental storytelling’ or ‘spatial
dramaturgy, ’ and is what Burickson[5] would call ‘physical im-
mersion. ’ In the case of music, the beer glasses on the stage beside
jazz musicians and the low lighting could be considered to be the
mise-en-scène of a gig, physically setting the scene and marking
what kind of performance is about to happen.
2.1.3 Ontological immersion. Where worldbuilding really thrives,
though, is in interactive, participatory theatre. In an immersive
environment where the audience is placed within the bounds
of the work not as passive bystanders but as active participants,
mise-en-scène plays a different, more important role. The design
of space and setting in immersive theatre goes beyond mere back-
ground, actively inviting the audience to explore and interact,
thus contributing to the narrative and emotional depth of the
experience.
Worldbuilding elements are crucial in immersive environ-
ments because they provide the sensory and narrative depth
and detail that encourages audience participation [15, 19].
Machon [15] notes that worldbuilding improves ‘sense-making, ’
or the way we understand the scenario of an interactive experi-
ence. Burickson[5] would call this type of immersion ‘ontological
immersion, ’ as we construct a personal understanding or narra-
tive coherence of what we are experiencing. This in turn allows
for a more rich experience, as the audience relates to things that
are occurring in the experience.
For instance, in Punchdrunk’s interactive VR work Believe
Your Eyes (2017), the actor that appears in the VR experience
subsequently appears in real life once the audience member has
left the venue, breaking down the notion of the static VR work
as a means of growing the audience’s interaction with the work
beyond the initial world they experienced. This multi-sensory
engagement is central to immersive experiences, as highlighted
in works by companies like Punchdrunk [15].
Here, the life of the work extends beyond the written dia-
logue or blocking, because the theatremakers have engaged in
worldbuilding around the traditional frame of a theatre show.
Retail services and customer-facing settings have already noticed
this, demonstrating that storytelling and theatrical elements can
significantly enhance engagement and creativity in service pro-
vision [12].
So far we have explored three types of immersion Burick-
son [5] puts forward – physical, psychological and ontological
immersion. These techniques are closely related to broader tech-
niques of narrative and worldbuilding. But what of these types of
immersion have been explored in music composition and DMIs?

2.2 Related work
So far we have discussed the immersive techniques that centre
around storytelling and worldbuilding in the context of theatre.
To be clear, worldbuilding occurs already in music – when we
attend a live concert, as Small [21] points out, even concert halls
“. . . are highly specialized buildings, designed down to the last
detail to house not just musical performances but performances
of a very specific kind” [21]. That is, when we attend an orchestra
concert, the narrative is that of attending with a group of like-
minded people who are there to share in the consumption of a
skilled performance, and the mise-en-scène is everything from
the usher’s uniform to the plushness of the seats. In a sense,
this is like ‘immersive theatre’ in that it has a very clear style
and involves the audience in a very particular way. That being
said, the fact that diverse performances take place in the same
venue despite its consistent design, suggests that this aspect is
not typically a concern for musicians or performers, and likely
not for audiences either.
There are also comparisons to be made with immersive music
projects in the digital space that use different forms of mixed
and virtual realities, such as Laurie Anderson’s Puppet Motel
[1] (an interative CD-ROM), Pauline Oliveros’ Rotating Brains /
Beating Heart [2] (a mixed reality performance) and Juan Carlos
Vasquez’s Ecstasy / Light / Inertia [23] (an interactive gamified
musical experience).
However, what we are interested in is how these immersive
techniques apply to a more active audience experience in the
context of a live performance and DMIs. That is, how can these
techniques be used when audiences are active participants in the
music?
Noting the spike in popularity of this genre in theatre, it is
interesting to observe that the realm of participatory music hasn’t
seen the use of these techniques as widely. That is, works such as
Ferrari’s SOCIÉTÉ 1 [11], Cardew’sScratch Orchestra [6] and Louis
Andriessen’s Volkslied [3] which involve audience participation,
occur in the ‘world’ and narrative of a traditional concert hall or
venue. They are immersive in the sense that some performers
might surround the audience or break the fourth wall, but they
are not immersive in that they usually share the same background
context – the ‘world’ of functional musical performance.
It is worth noting that participatory music performances have
of course been presented at NIME in the past, such as Carsen’s
Mesh Garden [7], and DMIs have been utilised in several partici-
patory music performances such as Machover’s Brain Opera [16].
But in many participatory music works we have attended, the
lack of an explicit narrative around participation means that the
reason or story behind why an audience member is contributing
is because that is how the artwork functions. In immersive theatre,
that is not the case due to the narrative drive and worldbuilding
that occurs around the works – participation in this genre is not
just because “that’s how it works, ” but because the audience’s
ontological, physical and psychological reality becomes that of
the work.
Thus, we posit that music and DMIs stand to benefit from
research that has already been conducted in immersive theatre
disciplines. These techniques have been shown to be an effective
means of increasing interest and engagement amongst audiences
across a broad spectrum of artforms [ 15]. Worldbuilding and
storytelling that involves the audience has been shown in above
sections to increase active participation, and we extrapolate on
this idea below using our own work as an example.

2.3 Project Background
The AirSticks is a small wireless device, that can be worn or put
into objects, which converts movement into sound. Utilising an
IMU, data is transmitted via Bluetooth to a computer running our
own custom software we call AirWare. The data from AirWare
is then interpreted and sent via MIDI or OSC to music making
software such as Ableton Live, Max/MSP or Supercollider. For a
detailed technical overview see [22].
The instrument has been developed at Monash University’s
SensiLab and used in hundreds of performances since 2013. The
overall focus of the AirSticks project is to bring accessible mu-
sic making experiences to the broader community. A detailed
technical review of the AirSticks is beyond the scope of this pa-
per. For more on the AirSticks as an Accessible Digital Musical
Instrument (ADMI) see [13].
3 The show
In late 2022, the three authors were approached to present a kids’
workshop at Casula Powerhouse in Sydney, Australia as part of
the Way Out West (‘WoW’) Festival for children and families.
The workshop would involve the AirSticks as a means of helping
children create music in a safe and enjoyable school holiday
setting.
However, the recruitment of the second author (E) - a profes-
sional actor - and the development time we had available to us,
meant the workshop slowly transitioned away from a workshop
into a theatre show. The key foundation we wanted to achieve
in the show was an interactive adventure that culminated in
the children playfully making music together with DMIs. We
ideally wanted to establish a rich and satisfying context for kids
to play music, as opposed to some technology workshops we
had witnessed previously which typically involved a hands-off,
‘play this’ approach. As development progressed, it became clear
that the best way to achieve this would be through a show, not a
workshop – thus You’re An Instrument! was born.
The show has since been performed 59 times to 4,300 students,
with a large focus on getting the show in front of children with
Disability in regional areas. The show continues to be toured,
including a season at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2025.
A trailer of the show can be viewed in Figure 2.
3.1 Plot
The show begins with a seemingly boring and conventional work-
shop on various music technologies, led by the first and third
authors (C and A), who introduce themselves as researchers,
wearing lab coats and using technical language. In the workshop,
which spans the history of instrument technology both analogue
and digital, the C accidentally reveals a twist: the existence of

an experimental pill capable of turning humans into musical
instruments.
C immediately attempts to hide this reveal on account of it
being a dangerous experiment, but A, intrigued by the prospect
of a human trial, advocates for an immediate experiment on
an audience member. Following an ethical discussion and an
agreement that the experiment could never be tried on someone
under eighteen, consent is given by E, an audience member (and
plant). E signs a waiver and takes the pill, but the experiment goes
immediately wrong as he generates violent sounds and threatens
destruction, against the researchers’ wishes.
Chaos ensues, but E is calmed by the children’s suggestions
of gentle thoughts, realising that he can think of any sound and
play it by moving his body. Buoyed by his newfound powers,
he takes the audience on a wild musical adventure, generating
novel sounds and visiting strange places through a virtuosic
performance.
After the performance, though, he feels hollow – all E wanted
to do was make music with other people. That wish suddenly
manifests as it’s discovered that he can in fact transform any
ordinary object into a musical instrument simply by touching it.
The culmination of the show features an impromptu ensemble
performance with E and the children forming a band, as the
children shake, dance and move instruments and AirSticks to
create music together.
A showreel of You’re an Instrument! can be viewed in Figure 3.
3.2 Technical and musical elements
The technical setup forYou’re an Instrument! allows for a seamless
presentation of the above narrative. All AirSticks remain hidden
throughout the show (until the Q+A at the end), creating the
effect that E and the objects are creating sound through the pill
technology.
We use five AirSticks in total, utilising a combination of in-
strument mappings and cues to create the illusion that objects
are turning into instruments (see Figure 4).
For instance, when E touches the tissue box (transferring his
powers into the object), instead of moving the location of the
AirStick, we simply fade out the AirStick mapping on E’s right
arm and fade in the AirStick instrument mapping from the tissue
box.
In order to facilitate these cues, I trigger each change using a
wearable Bluetooth scrolling ring1 that advances through cues on
a QLab2 session on Laptop 2. The five AirSticks are all mapped to
a single Ableton Live session on Laptop 1 through AirWare. The

4 Discussion
This discussion unpacks how narrative elements and worldbuild-
ing contributed to a participatory musical environment that en-
couraged children to actively participate and play music in the
show. In order to demonstrate this, we highlight four key mo-
ments in the show alongside research discussed in Section 2.1,
that build towards the centrepiece of the show – the children in
the audience making music.

Figure 6: E loses control.
4.1 The reveal
“Three, two, one... you’re an instrument!”
Up until this countdown in the show, the logical reality of the
audience has operated in the same world they have in any other
musical workshop. That is, the music-making technology used
up to this point is known to all children, whether it be a snare
drum, or a drum pad in GarageBand. The context or narrative of
the show is one they are familiar with, having most likely taken
part in educational workshops previously.
After the countdown, however, we enter a new reality where
the experimental pill really has managed to turn a person into an
instrument. E loses control – every time he moves, an enormous
crunching occurs, as we map the smallest of E’s gestures to
loud noises (see image in Figure 6). We also hear E’s thoughts,
descending into him screaming “I could destroy this whole room!”
The impact of this moment was carefully designed to have
the greatest amount contrast to the previous ten minutes of the
workshop. The mise-en-scène changes immediately. The lights,
which have been on a house white setting, suddenly cut off as if
malfunctioning, and are replaced by a dramatic red wash. Lights
on stage begin to flicker, smoke begins to rise from the scientists’
laptops, and a crunching sound rips through the speakers which
have previously been unused in the show. This dramatic change
signals that we have crossed the threshold into a reality very
different from the traditional workshop moments ago.
The sound mapping itself uses an extremely sensitive move-
ment threshold. Any accelerometer value changes over time,
even an arm movement of a few millimeters, causes the trigger-
ing of multiple modelled, distorted synthesiser notes that create
the effect of a malfunctioning experiment. We use two physical
modeling synthesisers layered on top of a white noise generator,
emulating a string instrument that is akin to the sound of scrap-
ing fingers on a blackboard. In fact, the reveal has had so much
impact in the past that it has caused children to run out of the
theatre or classroom, only to join back in moments later when
the energy calms.
This reveal plays an important part in the show, because it
immediately places the children in an alien environment, where
seemingly impossible ideas are possible. By using a combination
of lighting, special effects and a distorted AirStick mapping, we
are intimating that this silly experiment of turning bodily move-
ments into sound is real (the irony of this is that E is wearing
technology that actually achieves this, a nice allusion towards
the Clarke [8] observation that “any sufficiently advanced tech-
nology is indistinguishable from magic” [8]).
In this moment, we open the children up to the possibility of a
new musical reality. Through the storytelling and scene-setting
Figure 7: C and A handling E to improve his ‘piano tech-
nique’.
of this dramatic moment, we emphasise the fact that movement
really can be converted into sound without musical experience.
Even early on in the show, we scaffold the idea that it is possible
to simply move in whatever way one might desire, however silly
it might look, and create music and sound. Our hope is that the
children empathise with E throughout this process, whether or
not they can play an instrument, because E has clearly stated he
“isn’t a musician” and “can’t play an instrument. ”
This is the first of four moments that contribute to an envi-
ronment that encourages musical participation.
4.2 Power and control
“This is not what I want to play!”
In the early stages of his discovery that he is playing different
instruments with his mind and body, E decides to “think of a harp”
in order to play it – an instrument he “...always wanted to play. ”
The scientists immediately shut him down, asking him instead to
“think of a piano, ” a more traditional instrument in their minds.
Against his wishes, E’s movements then map to a piano. The
sound mapping on the AirSticks creates the effect of playing an
invisible piano – as E raises his hands and moves them out in
front of him, piano notes are triggered that are quantised in both
rhythm (a steady quaver pulse) and pitch (C major pentatonic
scale).
The scientists use this opportunity to correct his technique,
noting that if he wants to become a ‘real’ musician, he will have
to use proper technique, such as curving his fingers and keeping
his back straight. The scientists physically manipulate E like a
puppet, disempowering him and correcting his movements by
physically handling him in front of the audience, as seen in Figure
7.
The moment reaches a peak when E pushes away the scientists
in frustration, lamenting the fact that he has so many other
musical ideas he wants to explore besides the piano.
We chose to labour on this moment in the show because we
are hoping the children will draw comparisons with their own
experiences of learning music at school or outside the classroom.
As someone who has taught and been taught instrumental music
in schools, I am acutely aware of the anxiety and reluctance many
students can feel during music lessons and performances, and
this has been well-documented in the literature [4].
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Frame et al.
Figure 8: E playing ‘farts’ to everyone’s amusement.
Students often have an instrument picked for them, like I did
when I was in primary school, being made to play the flute be-
cause the saxophone I chose was too heavy. Students are also put
through sometimes uncomfortable and, to the student, seemingly
meaningless exercises like scales or tone and fingering exercises
that they may not feel contributes to their overall musical experi-
ence. Setting aside the possible impacts or benefits on their future
musical endeavours, what I’m particularly interested in here is
how music students are made to perceive music production, and
what potential creative outlets this might preclude.
Of course, mastery of an instrument is a very different process
and motivation to using the mappings and AirSticks in the show,
which display characteristics of a classic DMI with a very low
entry point, and a low ceiling [9] – they cannot be mastered like a
typical acoustic instrument, and they can be immediately played.
But if they have the means to get music lessons (which many
do not), students learning instruments usually have to prescribe
to the traditional models of learning, which strive for perfection
in the delivery of a very specific set of criteria that accompany
the Western canon of musical works. Likewise, E is being forced
to play an instrument that he doesn’t want to play, in a manner
he doesn’t want to play it. We raise this narrative point to create
empathy between E and the children in the audience as a means
of exploring the possibility of musical alternatives they will see
opened later in the show.
This is a political statement: we are explicitly shutting down
E’s seemingly unlimited musical power, controlled through his
mind, by limiting him to a rudimentary piano lesson. The futility
of the scientists’ control thus serves to build a world with these
power structures in mind, illustrating how the traditional model
of music-making in schools (lessons and performance), may not
always be the only choice. By telling a story and creating a fic-
tional reality that reflects their own, we are establishing a value
system and means of interpreting their current environment like
Reason and Heinemeyer [20] propose – one that they might be
more likely to actively participate in.
4.3 The fart
“Did you just think of farts?”
Every good kids show has a fart joke in it.You’re an Instrument!
has many fart jokes, and we’d like to explain why.
The first moment of farts comes about as E, upon attempting
to think of another instrument, suddenly plays the sound of farts
every time he moves (seen in Figure 8).
C and A quiz E on why he would think of farts when his
thoughts are influencing the sounds he plays, but E denies having
thought of them entirely. It is thus concluded that the audience’s
thoughts must be influencing the sounds E makes, much like how
the audience calmed him down with ‘calm thoughts’ earlier in
the show.
E: I swear I didn’t think of farts!
A: Well it has to be someone! [to C] Did you think
of farts?
C: I didn’t! I think they [gesturing to children] must
have thought of farts!
In the fart moment, the AirStick instrument is mapped in an
almost identical manner to the piano sound above, but the sample
is replaced by random chopped up sections of a fart sample
sourced from a sound library instead. This produces exactly the
effect it sounds like it does – when E moves, it sounds like he’s
farting in quantised time.
Much like in Section 4.2, here we are emphasising a conceptual
point. By demonstrating two ideas through the narrative of the
show, we hope to influence music creation later.
The first idea we raise through this moment is that we are in
an environment where everyone’s thoughts might be influencing
the musical and sonic result. By setting up the idea that someone
in the audience might be changing E’s ‘body-instrument’ with
their own thoughts, we are opening up the possibility of making
them feel like an active contributor to the show as it unfolds.
The second idea that the fart sounds raise is an expansion of
what music and sound might look like. By creating an absurd
mapping that transforms body movements into fart sounds, we
are illustrating that this environment is open to any sound and
mapping that one can think of.
We are operating in a shared musical environment, where
all our thoughts and actions influence each other, and we can
make any sound we might desire – all it takes is to think about
it and move. This is the narrative of the show, but it is also
the musical reality that DMI practitioners and composers like
ourselves operate in – we have the ability to map nearly any
movement to a limitless amount of sounds, it takes only the
thought process and reasoning to achieve it.
4.4 Joining the band
“Let me have a try!”
After E’s virtuosic solo, showing the audience the limits of his
musical ability and everything he’d like to do with his newfound
abilities, he becomes so overwhelmed with emotion that he sheds
a tear, wiping it away with a tissue. Shortly after this, he suddenly
loses his musical abilities, unable to play anything. After a brief
back and forth with the audience’s help, it is discovered that E
has transferred his powers into an inanimate object – the tissue
box.
The scientists, the original sceptics of E’s powers, are over-
joyed, and celebrate by passing the tissue box between them,
playing the instrument themselves. E intervenes by requesting
that the children should not only play it, but add to the sounds.
The tissue box is passed around, gaining all sorts of silly sounds
(including fart noises) as each child contributes a ‘thought’ to the
box.
This moment culminates in E activating the ‘musical powers’
of two more objects (a koala bear and the pill box) that each form
parts of a band, with E asking children to “think of a bass guitar!”
and “think of a melody!” to complete the trio of instruments.
The mapping uses previously composed MIDI fragments being
revealed in a way that means the instruments are all quantised
and using the same scale mode as each other, creating the feeling
of musical cohesion.

Each AirStick ‘instrument’ is passed around in addition to
acoustic auxiliary percussion instruments, and children are en-
couraged to move and vocalise other silly sounds that they might
like to hear in the band.
This active audience participation is not an appended moment
at the end of the show, it is the peak of the narrative structure
that not only asks but encourages the children to make music.
The audience has become a necessary part of the band, and the
narrative and worldbuilding of the show has culminated in the
participatory moment, as seen in Figure 9.
5 Conclusion
The common thread in all of these moments in You’re an Instru-
ment! is that we have used narrative techniques and worldbuild-
ing to create an environment within the kids show that we believe
is more conducive to active participation at the big moment in
the show – when the music-making is done by the audience. By
using cleverly placed narrative moments across the show, and
building a new reality with the help of worldbuilding elements,
the music composition in the show is enhanced through the new
context that encourages audience participation, as seen in Figure
10.
We state this to contribute not to a dramatic framework, but
directly to the composition and DMI position we are putting
forward – narrative and worldbuilding are in fact compositional
tools that help provide examples and reasons why an audience
member might interact with and create music with DMIs. Ac-
tive musical participation is not just something that happens in
You’re an Instrument! , it is an inevitable and encouraged result of
a logical series of (albeit fictional) narrative moments that place
the audience in a more active, comfortable and safe environment
where they can play music. This is different to a music workshop,
where the inevitable result of playing is achieved by asking some-
one to play or try an instrument. Here, we are applying both the
mise-en-scène and narrative techniques discussed earlier as a
means of scaffolding active audience engagement, using fictional
scenarios based in truth to enhance empathy and understanding
(much like Reason and Heinemeyer [20] propose) that may allow
for active audience engagement. In You’re An Instrument!, the
narrative and worldbuilding allowed students to feel comfortable
exploring silly sounds, and moving to play new sounds amongst
strangers. We have observed this technique working well with
adults as well, perhaps not in the manner of suspended belief,
but at the very least in the manner of scaffolding a structure
that provides reasons around participation. Thus, building on
immersive theatre disciplines, we propose that worldbuilding
and storytelling that involves the audience provides a scaffold-
ing that promotes more active audience participation and a new
relationship with DMIs.
