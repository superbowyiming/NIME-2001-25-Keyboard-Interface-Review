ABSTRACT
Many musical instruments exhibit an inherent latency or
delayed auditory feedback(DAF) between actuator activa-
tion and the occurrence of sound. We investigated how
DAF (73ms and 250ms) aﬀects musically trained(MT) and
non-musically trained (NMT) people’s ability to synchro-
nize the audible strum of an actuated guitar to a metronome
at 60bpm and 120bpm. The long DAF matched a sub-
division of the overall tempo. We compared their perfor-
mance using two diﬀerent input devices with feedback be-
fore or on activation. While 250ms DAF hardly aﬀected
musically trained participants, non-musically trained par-
ticipants’ performance declined substantially both in mean
synchronization error and its spread. Neither tempo nor
input devices aﬀected performance.

1. INTRODUCTION
Delayed auditory feedback (DAF) between activation of con-
trols and production of sound can be disruptive, and reduce
expressiveness and synchronization performance. DAF in-
creases synchronization errors but musicians can use sub-
divisions of the overall tempo to reduce synchronization
errors. Regardless of musical training, slow tempos re-
duce synchronization performance with an increased bias to
tap before the beat. Studies conducted until now have fo-
cused mostly on how DAF aﬀects musically trained people.
The synchronization performance of people with no musical
training under DAF and at diﬀerent tempos is unknown. It
is also unclear whether actuator feedback can help to cope
with DAF. This is particularly important for assistive in-
terfaces for musical expression (aIMEs), which often incur
additional latencies, e.g. from ﬁltering or verifying gestures

to improve accessibility, and are used by people with less
musical training, e.g. in musical therapy.
2. BACKGROUND
Many instruments exhibit an inherent latency ordelayed au-
ditory feedback(DAF) between actuator activation and the
occurrence of sound. For example, by moderating velocity
a pianist can manipulate the latency by pressing (activat-
ing) a piano key to the audible onset of a soft note by as as
much as 100ms [2]. While some musicians can detect laten-
cies as low as 7-10ms [5], people tapping along to a beat on
average have a tendency to tap before the actual beat. This
anticipation biasamounts to around 50ms for non-musically
trained people and about 14ms for musically trained people
[1]. This bias, however, does not aﬀect the ability to keep
a continuous and steady beat. Highly skilled musicians can
deviate from inter-tap intervals as little as 4ms [11]. In-
creased DAF can lead to note errors (sequencing of notes),
prolonged play time, erratic changes in key stroke veloc-
ity, and errors in inter-hand coordination. This disruption
increases with delay and its eﬀect peaks at 200ms, after
which it decreases again [5, 9]. DAF can degrade the per-
ceived quality of an instrument [6]. Pfordresher and Palmer
showed that DAF disruption in a rhythmical sequence using
professional pianists could be lowered if the DAF was close
to a subdivision of the overall tempo [9].
The average ﬂutter, i.e. the diﬀerences between adjacent
Inter-Onset-Intervals (IOI), of the hits by a professional
percussionist playing along to a metronome ranged between
10 and 40ms or between 2-8% of the associated tempo in
relative terms [4], suggesting that tempo moderated antici-
pation bias. Takano deﬁned synchronization error (SE) as
the diﬀerence between the point in time from a metronome
beat and the activation of a note [12].
Asynchronies of 50ms or more between diﬀerent orches-
tra members are common already from the spatial arrange-
ments, e.g. a distance of 10 meters adds 30ms due to the
speed of sound [10].
Interfaces for musical expression (IMEs) can provide pri-
mary feedback such as visual, auditive (instrument noise),
tactile, and kinesthetic or secondary feedback (the gener-
ated sound). Bongers described passive feedbackas the feed-
back produced by the physical characteristics of the system
(clicking noise of a button etc.) or as active feedback pro-
duced in response to a certain gesture [3].
3. STUDY
The test investigated how precisely musically trained(MT)
(regardless of instrument) andnon-musically trained(NMT)
people could synchronize the audible strum of the actuated
456
guitar [7] to a metronome given either a small (73ms) in-
herent system delay (from triggering the input device to
sound) or a large delay of 250ms. We compared two foot
pedals providing diﬀerent haptic feedback to investigate if
earlier haptic pre-activation feedback could help the partic-
ipants to better synchronize the strum to the metronome
beat.
3.1 The Strumming Device
The aIME used was the Actuated Guitar [7], which is an
oﬀ-the-shelf electrical guitar (Epiphone SG) ﬁtted with a
strumming device operated by a foot pedal for improved
accessibility. The strumming device was made from a mo-
torised mixing desk fader positioned above the bridge pickup
(see Figure 1) to drive a glued-on pick across the strings.
Foam stoppers at each end of the fader shortened the dis-
tance the pick had to travel, lowering latency and reducing
noise when the pick hit the end of the fader. An Arduino
controlled motor managed the speed and direction of the
pick. Two diﬀerent foot pedals activated a strum of all
strings. The ﬁrst consisted of a momentary button mounted
in a plastic housing, which raised the button 5.5cm above
the ground. The button provided haptic feedback (resis-
tance) from the time it was ﬁrst touched to when it was
fully depressed taking typically around 30ms. The second
input device, made from a force sensitive resistor (FSR)
taped ﬂush to a surface board, only provided haptic feed-
back when the foot hit the wooden backboard, see Figure 2.
3.2 Data Logging
The momentary button, FSR and metronome were all con-
nected to their own separate Arduino to avoid increasing the
computations on the Arduino in the guitar and thereby in-
creasing the latency of the guitar strum. An Adafruit Data
Logging Shield with a built in clock and SD-card reader
logged timestamps, metronome, sensor, and button data
with millisecond precision. These components were built
into the casing that held the momentary button.

bridge pickup. Gray foam stoppers on each side
reduced noise and the pick’s travel distance.
A custom-built Arduino-based metronome generated pri-
mary beats at 2.1kHz and the supporting beats at 1.7kHz
with a buzzer at either 60bpm or 120bpm. It provided no
visual indication of the beat. Each high beat was sent to
the data logger that allowed for the computation of synchro-
nization errors between the generated beats and the push

ing containing the data logger (left) and a force

data from the two input devices.
Using a 240 frames per second GoPro camera we deter-
mined a 45ms system latency between activation of the mo-
mentary button and the plectrum picking the ﬁrst string
and 73ms for the pick to reach the last string. For more
precise alignment and veriﬁcation of activations a camera
recorded an LED that lit up when the button closed the
circuit. The participants had no access to this visual feed-
back.
At both 60bpm and 120bpm, 250ms was the subdivision
closest to Finney and Pfordresher’s most disruptive delay
(200ms). To yield a 250ms delay between activation and
strum the Arduino controlling the motor added 177ms to
the system’s inherent 73ms delay.
3.3 Participants
We recruited twelve participants (n=12, age= 39.9 years,
from 16 to 65 years old, four women) - three from cam-
pus and nine without ties to higher education. Half of the
participants had at least ﬁve years of musical training or
experience from paid tuition or regular band practice - re-
ferred to as musically trained (MT) - the other half had
no musical training or experience - referred to as as non-
musically trained (NMT). All participants wore ﬂat soled
shoes. Guitar play experience was not required as the par-
ticipants merely strummed through foot activations and did
not ’play’ the guitar, e.g. fretting chords.
3.4 Procedure
The test participants were divided into two groups, each of
which consisted of three participants with musical training
and three without musical training. The ﬁrst group played
at a tempo of 60bpm and the second at a tempo of 120bpm
- the between subjects factor. Each participant played in
four conditions of bothdelays (73ms, 250ms) combined with
each input device(momentary button, FSR) as within sub-
ject factors. The orders of the input device and delay were
counterbalanced. At 60bpm the participants played four
minutes and at 120bpm two minutes at each condition to
ensure that each participant got the same amount of train-
457
ing, i.e. the number of times they triggered the input device.
We observed, video recorded, timed, and helped change
input devices and delays during each session. Before start-
ing in each condition, the participants were allowed a few
strums on the input device. The delay condition was not
disclosed to the participants, who had to adapt their timing
to synchronize to the metronome beat in each condition.
For each participant and condition we computed the me-
dian synchronization error (SE) - the time diﬀerence be-
tween the audible strum (derived from the activation times
tamp plus the system latency) and the metronome beat.
Negative values indicate strums before and positive values
indicate strums after the metronome beat. We computed
the SE spread as the diﬀerence between the third and the
ﬁrst quartile of the synchronization errors. The partici-
pants’ median synchronization errors and synchronization
error spreads - our dependent variables - were subjected to
four-way ANOVA tests with delay and input typeas within
and musical trainingand tempo as between subject factors.
4. RESULTS
We found a signiﬁcant main eﬀect for delay, F(1, 36)=26.7,
p≪0.001, and an interaction between musical training and
delay, F(1, 36)=27.3, p ≪0.001 on synchronization error.
While the mean synchronization error of musically trained
participants was close to constant, irrespective of delay, the
non-musically trained participants’ mean synchronization
error increased from −8.5ms for short (73ms) to 51ms for
long (250ms) delay, see Figure 3.

sically trained (MT) and non-musically trained
(NMT) participants (N=6+6) by delay including
0.95 conﬁdence interval error bars.
Similarly, the ANOVA test of the spread of the partic-
ipants’ synchronization error found the same eﬀects - for
delay, F(1, 36)=21.7, p≪0.001, and the interaction (see Fig-
ure 4) between musical training and delay, F(1, 36)=10.6,
p=0.002. While musically trained participants had an in-
creased synchronization spread from 44ms to 55ms, this dif-
ference was not signiﬁcant according to a t-test (t(5)=0.71,
p=0.51). In comparison to the low delay, the high delay al-
most doubled the mean spread of the synchronization error
(from 73ms to 137ms) of the non-musically trained partici-
pants. The density plots in Figure 5 for 60bpm, momentary
button, 73ms and 250ms delay illustrate the bigger spread
for the non-musically trained participants.
For tempo we found no eﬀect on the mean synchroniza-
tion error but the ANOVA on its spread bordered signif-

icance F(1, 36)=3.57, p=0.067. At 120bpm the spread of
synchronization errors was larger (88ms) than at 60bpm
(67ms). Neither on synchronization error nor on its spread
did we ﬁnd signiﬁcant eﬀects for input type. Regarding in-
put devices all participants mentioned the lack of primary
feedback (haptic, visual, auditive) [8] when using the FSR,
which made correct positioning of the foot diﬃcult. This
lack of feedback prompted them to bend down and lift their
foot to use the eyes for guidance. Three users lost the posi-
tion during the test and struggled to quickly ﬁnd the resting
position again before continuing the test.
Moreover, seven participants (all male) with bigger feet
initially needed some time to ﬁnd a comfortable foot po-
sition on the enclosure with the momentary button as the
physical dimensions in height and length of the casing con-
taining the momentary button made it diﬃcult to quickly
ﬁnd a good pivot position. Four participants found that the
passive feedback [3] (clicking sound) from the momentary
button distracted them from focusing on the metronome.
The height of the momentary button, combined with the
short length of the housing, made it impossible to rest the
heel on the ﬂoor while pushing the button, which forced the
participants to position their foot on the edge of the hous-
ing to get a good pivot point. That caused some starting
issues, but after a few minutes it was not an issue. Four
participants (mixed) complained that it was diﬃcult to fo-
cus on the metronome as some felt it was drifting, others
locked on to an oﬀ-beat, and some felt the passive feedback
from the momentary button was distracting.
5. DISCUSSION
Figure 3 shows that NMT participants performed better
(with smaller synchronization errors) than MT participants
with the short delay (73ms). At ﬁrst glance this seems to
contradict that musicians tend to have smaller synchroniza-
tion errors (in the form of a small negative anticipation bias)
compared to non-musically trained. However, remember
that the synchronization error was computed as the distance
from the strumming of the last string to the metronome
beat. If we computed the synchronization error from the
ﬁrst string (45ms) the mean synchronization error would
be -36ms for NMT and -10ms for MT. These values are a
lot closer to what previous research has found [1, 4]. This
shows that the participants were, in fact, trying to synchro-

nize to the beginning of the strum and could factor in the
system delay (45ms to ﬁrst string). The results indicate MT
participants were not aﬀected by the large delay, but NMT
participants’ synchronization error was increased by 60ms.
While the NMT’s mean synchronization error of 50ms seems
low, as these are common in musical performances [10], the
actual spread of their synchronization errors at 250ms DAF
was rather large (138ms) (see Figure 4 and 5), which shows
that NMT participants were struggling to reliably synchro-
nize to the beat. The MT participants performed equally
well under both delays with a small increase in spread, sug-
gesting that they could time their activations consistently,
unaﬀected by the 250ms DAF. Asked about their strategy
for coping with the long DAF, two MT participants explic-
itly mentioned recognising hitting the subdivision of the
beat in this setting - in line with Pfordresher’s ﬁndings.
The two tempos used in our study did not aﬀect synchro-
nization error spread substantially (11ms diﬀerence), but
the trend was in the opposite direction of previous ﬁndings
by Dahl [4]. Her participants, however, did not play along
to a metronome, played at faster tempo, and experienced
no DAF. Future research needs to address this further.
While the input devices had some notable diﬀerences and
participants struggled to a small degree with them, this
did not aﬀect the participants’ performance. They per-
formed equally well using the momentary button and the
FSR to control the strumming. The qualitative feedback
highlighted confusions stemming from the auditory pre–
activation feedback that might have negated the tactile feed-
back beneﬁts of the momentary button before activation.
6. CONCLUSION
Delayed auditory feedback has detrimental eﬀects on syn-
chronization performance of non-musically trained people.
Unlike for musically trained people this cannot be overcome
by increasing system delays to subdivisions of the overall
tempo. When building assistive instruments for rehabili-
tation purposes designers should strive to minimize system
latency. While our healthy participants’ synchronization
performance did not beneﬁt from an input device with pre-
activation feedback, this might not hold in musical ther-
apy due to other beneﬁts these controls provide. Musically
trained people can be subjected to longer DAF if they are
close to subdivisions of the overall tempo, which implies
that aIMEs should allow for adjusting activation latency.
