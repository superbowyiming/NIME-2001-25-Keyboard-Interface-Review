ABSTRACT
In this study, an analog synthesizer module using Aloe vera
was proposed as a biomemristor. The recent revival of
analog modular synthesizers explores novel possibilities of
sounds based on unconventional technologies such as inte-
grating biological forms and structures into traditional cir-
cuits. A biosignal has been used in experimental music as
the material for composition. However, the recent devel-
opment of a biocomputor using a slime mold biomemristor
expands the use of biomemristors in music. Based on prior
research, characteristics of Aloe vera as a biomemristor were
electrically measured, and two types of analog synthesizer
modules were developed, current to voltage converter and
current spike to voltage converter. For this application, a
live performance was conducted with the CVC module and
the possibilities as a new interface for musical expression
were examined.

1. INTRODUCTION
Synthesizers have been developed as a tool for exploring new
musical expressions using electrical technologies such as a
newly invented transistor or integrated circuit (IC). How-
ever, the digital revolution in the 1980s changed their role to
simulating sounds of various musical instruments. The orig-
inal function of analog synthesizers, which was generating
sounds by adjusting knobs freely to explore the possibili-
ties of new musical expression, became complex and was
replaced with presets during the transition from analog to
digital synthesizers in the 1980s [9, 15].
The synthesizers have been revived with the rise of stan-
dardization of modular synthesizers, such as Eurorack, de-
signed by Doepfer in the 1990s. This standard of dimensions
and voltage levels made modules from diﬀerent vendors

compatible, improved accessibility, and increased sound di-
versity [13]. For example,Cyclops (2016) is a Eurorack
video synthesizer module, which can control a laser show
projector via control voltage [8].MOTOR SYNTH (2019) is
an electro-mechanical synthesizer that uses electromotors as
its main sound source. The synthesizer produces sounds by
controlling the rotational speed of electromotors that pre-
cisely correspond to a musical note [7]. Some of these uncon-
ventional modules integrate biological forms and structures
as materials into its circuit. The history of artists using
biological phenomena for musical expression is discussed in
the next section.
2. RELA TED WORK
The attempts to use biological phenomena for musical ex-
pression have been explored since the beginning of the 20th
century. A pioneering work that transforms the brain wave
of a performer into sounds wasMusic for Solo Performer
composed by Alvin Lucier in 1965 [4]. The sound was emit-
ted from loudspeakers and resonated to nearby percussion
instruments. The resulting sounds, heard by the perform-
ers, aﬀected their brain waves, and then this process was
looped [12]. While Lucier did not use brain waves again,
other musicians expanded the research in the 1960s and
1970s by recording and performing with biosignals, such
as myoelectricity and heartbeats. The process to translate
a brain wave into sound was a challenge, because the fre-
quency of the brain wave was too low to perceive. Richard
Teitelbaum solved this problem by integrating a modular
synthesizer, which had been presented by Robert Moog in
1964, into his compositionOrgan Music in 1968. He used
a brain wave as a control voltage for synthesizer modules
such as a voltage control oscillator (VCO), voltage control
ﬁlter (VCF) and voltage control ampliﬁer (VCA) [14]. This
was a pioneering work that used biological phenomena in a
framework of synthesizers.
The recent biotechnological progress has been expand-
ing the possibilities of new musical expression. For ex-
ample,cellF (2015) was the ﬁrst autonomous synthesizer
aimed at collaborating with musicians or performing in-
dependently. This synthesizer was controlled by a neural
network that was cultivated from the author’s skin cell by
induced pluripotent stem cell biotechnology [11].Earth Re-
turn Distortion (ERD)(2015) is a synthesizer module that
integrates a small block of earth into its circuit. The earth
distorts and ampliﬁes signals as they pass through [5].Sono-
matter (2017) is a sound installation and performance that
uses a custom-designed synthesizer, which can transform
electrical signals produced by microorganisms into sounds

mold biomemristor and presented its application to musi-
cal expression in 2016 [10]. They used the biomemristor
as a data-driven processing unit in a biocomputer. The
non-linear property of the memristor was used to map and
generate sounds from input melodies by combining it with
a microcomputer.
Our study focused on developing two synthesizer modules
using the non-linear properties of an Aloe vera biomemris-
tor. The use of Aloe vera and other biological substances in
synthesizers is dependent upon the existence of a memristor.
3. MEMRISTOR
A memristor is the fourth fundamental circuit element, which
was theorized by Leon Chua in 1971. He proposed many
interesting and valuable circuit properties of a memristor.
However, a practical physical model was not developed un-
til 2008. Mathematically, the resistance of a memristor, R,
is called memristance, M, and is described as follows:
M = R(q) = dδ(q)
dq (1)
where δ and q denote the ﬂux and charge, respectively. In
contrast to the other three fundamental circuit elements,
a memristor has a non-linear property. Chua insisted a
pinched hysteresis loop of an ideal memristor was symmet-
rical and passed through the origin as shown in Fig.1 [3].

Other researchers reported that a memristor exhibited a
current spike response to a sudden change in an applied
voltage. Gale et al. reported this behavior and proposed an
analytical model [6], where the current spike was observed
whenever an applied voltage changed. The spike was re-
producible with a high probability and its direction was the
same as the change in the applied voltage. Moreover, Mi-
randa et al. insisted that the altitude of the current spike
had a positive correlation with the altitude of the change in
voltage [2].
Recent theoretical analysis has revealed the existence of a
memristor in neural networks, voltage-gated channels, etc.
In particular, a memristor made of biomaterial is called a
biomemristor. Volkov et al. found the existence of the
properties of a memristor in plants such as Aloe vera and
Mimosa pudica [17].
4. MEASUREMENT
Based on prior research, two experiments were conducted
to electrically measure the properties of Aloe vera as a
biomemristor.
4.1 Existence of Memristor
The electrical current responses to applications of a sinu-
soidal wave were measured to conﬁrm the existence of a
memristor in Aloe vera. Following prior research [16], the
responses at two conditions were measured: inserting elec-
trodes along the vascular bundles and on the top and bot-
tom of an Aloe vera leaf.
From this experiment, the existence of a memristor in
Aloe vera was conﬁrmed. An Aloe vera biomemristor ex-
hibited a pinched hysteresis loop when sinusoidal waves with
a frequency of less than 0.01 and 0.1 Hz were applied from
the electrodes inserted along the vascular bundles and on
the top and bottom of the leaf, respectively. Fig.2 presents
an example of the pinched hysteresis loop observed in this
experiment. Notably, the electrical current response to an
applied voltage was non-linear.

Additionally, the pinched hysteresis loop becomes ideal as
the frequency of the applied voltage becomes smaller. The
properties of the memristor are aﬀected by the positions,
distance, and depth of electrodes inserted.
4.2 Current Spike
A current spike response to a sudden change in an applied
voltage was measured. A prior study [6] insisted that a cur-
rent spike could be observed in any memristor; however, one
was never observed in Aloe vera. Therefore, an experiment
was designed to observe and clarify the relationship between
the applied voltage and the behavior of a current spike. The
measurement was conducted with a self-building electrical
circuit that could amplify and convert electrical current to
voltage to improve observability.
As a result, the current spike was noted in Aloe vera,
which was determined by observing the magnitude of the
voltage that was applied before the change, its duration,
and the magnitude of change. Fig.3 presents an example of
the current spike observed in this experiment. In this mea-
surement, the electrical current was ampliﬁed by inserting
electrodes into the top and bottom of the leaf.
5. IMPLEMENT A TION
Two types of analog synthesizer modules were developed
with the biomemristor, the current to voltage converter
(CVC), and the current spike to voltage converter (CSVC).
5.1 CVC
The CVC module uses the non-linear electrical current wave
response of a biomemristor for a low frequency sinusoidal
wave. The CVC comprises a simple analog circuit with two
op-amps and resistors for converting the electrical current to
voltage as depicted in Fig.4. A performer can connect this
module to Aloe vera via two terminals (T1, T2), control

Figure 4: Circuit of the CVC module
As a complement to CVC, the super low frequency oscil-
lator (SLFO) module was also developed, which can change
the frequency from 0.001 to 0.1 Hz, and change the shape
of a wave from sinusoidal to triangle or square to enhance
the properties of the biomemristor. The SLFO is internally
connected to the CVC, and a performer can select the SLFO
or an external signal as the input of the CVC by switching
(S1). This module was originally developed on a bread-
board, then built on a universal board with a module box,
as presented in the image in Fig.5 (a).
5.2 CSVC
The CSVC module uses the current spike response of the
biomemristor to enable a sudden change in the applied volt-
age. The electrical circuit of the CSVC is the same as CVC,
but the variable resistor is changed from 10 to 100 kΩ to
amplify even a slight current spike. The image in Fig.5 (b)
shows the appearance of the box.

ule (a) and the CSVC module (b)
6. LIVE PERFORMANCE
The performance took place at NxPC.Live vol.40 & Freq,
KID× IAMAS LIVE at Kyushu University in Fukuoka,
Japan with the CVC module, and it examined the possibil-
ities of these developments as a new interface for musical
expression. The applications of the modules are discussed
in 6.1.
The CVC module was used with a legendary analog mod-
ular synthesizer, Roland SYSTEM 700. The SLFO was
patched into the CVC, and the signal was separated on a
multiple jack module and then inputted as a control voltage
for other modules, such as VCO and VCF. An oscilloscope
was used to observe the input and output signals of the
biomemristor, and adjusted by inserting the electrodes in
various places. The ampliﬁcation of the output signals were
modiﬁed by rotating a knob on the CVC during the per-
formance. The performance began with only a few sounds
using the module, for audiences to be able to understand
the sounds driven by the Aloe vera biomemristor, and then
other sounds were added.
6.1 Application
6.1.1 CVC
The CVC module outputs a non-linear voltage wave re-
sponse to an application of a sinusoidal wave. Fig.6 (a)
depicts the output voltage of the CVC response to the ap-
plication of a 0.1 Hz sinusoidal wave. The sounds could be
modulated with the non-linear property by inputting the
output of the CVC to other modules as a control voltage.
6.1.2 CSVC
The CSVC module outputs a voltage spike of the biomem-
ristor in response to a sudden change in the applied voltage.
The control voltage of the keyboard controller was the fo-
cus of the sudden change in voltage, because the keyboard
controller in analog synthesizers produces a voltage corre-
sponding to the key that is pressed. Fig.6 (b) depicts the
output voltage of the CSVC response to the control voltage
of the keyboard controller.

sponse to the application of 0.1 Hz sinusoidal wave
(yellow line) (a) and output of the CSVC (blue line)
response to the control voltage of the keyboard con-
troller (yellow line) (b)
If the output of the CSVC is inputted as a control voltage
to VCA, which is a module to amplify the signal, the current
spike could be used as an envelope generator.
7. DISCUSSION
7.1 Synthesizer Module
The synthesizer modules used herein are regarded as ba-
sic modules that use the properties of the biomemristor in
a framework of the voltage controlled modular synthesizer.
In this experiment, the non-linear electrical current wave
response to an application of a sinusoidal wave whose fre-
quency was less than 0.1 Hz was observed. Therefore, it was

used as a ﬁlter for the SLFO and its property was related
to musical expression as a form of modulation. However, if
a memristor was found that exhibited a non-linear property
with a sinusoidal wave of audible frequency, that property
could be directly applied as a ﬁlter for the VCO to generate
a new basic wave shape. The CSVC module was not used
in a live performance; however, its potential could expand
the possibilities of analog synthesizers diﬀerently from the
CVC module.
7.2 Properties of the Biomemristor
The properties of the biomemristor vary depending on the
insertion parameters of the electrodes, such as position,
depth and duration for which the voltage is applied. A pro-
cess of changing the insertion of electrodes was developed
for generating better sound resembling that of synthesizers,
such as adjusting the knobs. However, it is important to
clarify how the properties should be controlled in a stable
and consistent manner.
Miranda et al. standardized the properties of their slime
mold biomemristor by developing a receptacle for control-
ling their growth. In contrast, despite being easy to use and
measure, it is diﬃcult to standardize the Aloe vera biomem-
ristor because of the 3D form of the leaf.
7.3 Biomemristor and Musical Expression
The attempts using biological phenomena as material for
musical expression can be seen in the previous studies by
Alvin LucierMusic for Solo Performerand Richard Teitel-
baum Organ Music. In their compositions, the relationship
between auditory stimulation and the biosignal (i.e., brain
wave) worked as a function even during unconsciousness. In
contrast to this uncontrollable relationship, it is preferable
to have a more controllable function for the biomemristor.
In our modules, an input voltage was directly applied
to the biomemristor, the electrical current response of the
biomemristor was ampliﬁed, and the response was converted
to voltage. By controlling the sounds of the synthesizer
through voltage, the biomemristor in this application worked
as a function that directly processed sounds.
This is diﬀerent from the biomemristor used by Miranda
et al. as a component of computational mapping of input
melodies onto music data. These modules provide control-
lability, as well as direct and physical interaction with the
biomemristor, such as adjusting its characteristics by chang-
ing the insertion of electrodes.
8. CONCLUSION
In this study, two types of synthesizer modules were de-
veloped using the properties of an Aloe vera biomemristor.
The use of the biomemristor was presented as a direct func-
tion for analog sound processing with two modules, the CVC
and CSVC. The study highlighted how biomemristors ex-
panded the possibilities of new musical expression within
the framework of an analog modular synthesizer. The pos-
sibilities of the CVC module were explored through its ap-
plication in a live performance. The CSVC module was not
used in a live performance, so there is further potential to
expand the possibilities of analog synthesizers.
