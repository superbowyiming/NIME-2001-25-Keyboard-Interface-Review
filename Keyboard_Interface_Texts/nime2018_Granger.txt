ABSTRACT
Composing music typically requires years of music theory
experience and knowledge that includes but is not limited
to chord progression, melody composition theory, and an
understanding of whole-step/half-step passing tones among
others. For that reason, certain songwriters such as singers
may ﬁnd a necessity to hire experienced pianists to help
compose their music. In order to facilitate the process
for beginner and aspiring musicians, we have developed
Lumanote, a music composition tool that aids songwriters
by presenting real-time suggestions on appropriate melody
notes and chord progression. While a preliminary evalu-
ation yielded favorable results for beginners, many com-
mented on the diﬃculty of having to map the note sugges-
tions displayed on the on-screen interface to the physical
keyboard they were playing on. This paper presents the
resulting solution: an LED-based feedback system that is
designed to be directly attached to any standard MIDI key-
board. This peripheral aims to help map note suggestions
directly to the physical keys of a musical keyboard. A study
consisting of 22 individuals was conducted to compare the
eﬀectiveness of the new LED-based system with the existing
computer interface, ﬁnding that the vast majority of users
preferred the LED system. Three experienced musicians
also judged and ranked the compositions, noting signiﬁcant
improvement in song quality when using either system, and
citing comparable quality between compositions that used
either interface.

1. INTRODUCTION
The creation of modern music has relied increasingly on
the assistance of computer systems, and the composition
process itself has been largely enhanced by digital musical
creation tools. Current technologies tend to either focus
on analyzing existing music to extract meaningful meta-
data, or assisting authors in creating automatically or semi-
automatically generated music. Though this may greatly
facilitate the songwriting process, this risks a composition
losing the personality and identity of its creator. This mo-
tivated the creation of Lumanote, an interactive real-time
digital composition aid that suggests chords and melody
notes based on music theory concepts. The most common
feedback from a preliminary user study showed us a begin-
ner’s diﬃculty with mapping the interface suggestions with
the keys of the MIDI keyboard that they used. This mo-
tivated the creation of an LED-based interface, designed
to be directly attached to the keyboard itself, as a way to
provide more immediate feedback that directly maps to the
keys themselves. This paper summarizes related works in
this domain, the existing Lumanote system, and the intro-
duction of the new LED-based interface. We also describe
a new user study consisting of 22 participants that analyzes
the user experience of both the existing Lumanote monitor-
based interface and the new LED system. Additionally, we
use three experienced musicians to judge and rank the user
compositions.
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORKS
2.1 Musical Analysis Tools
Some computer-based musical applications focus on em-
ploying algorithms to analyze and generate metadata about
music. One such system, detailed by Bello et al., extracts
rhythmic and harmonic information about a song without
attempting to transcribe said song in its entirety [2]. Ab-
216
dallah et al. introduces a model for extracting structural
components such as a verse, the chorus, and the introduc-
tion of a piece of music for the purposes of cataloging, music
summarizing, and song identiﬁcation [1]. More recent de-
velopments have focused on automating harmonic analysis
using theories of tonal harmony as its backbone, such as the
work of De Haas et al. [9]. While these technologies employ
music theory to existing pieces, they are only analytic in
purpose and do not play an active role in the creation new
music. Leveraging the same basic principles for the compo-
sition of music is a signiﬁcant motivator for the creation of
Lumanote and its diﬀerent interfaces.
2.2 Tools for Musical Composition
Several technologies have been developed to help musical
composition through procedural generation, with increas-
ingly more complex methods of input and parameters that
aﬀect the resulting output for more musically interesting
material. Diaz-Jerez leveraged his previous technology of
FractMus into a project called Melomics in order to assist
in the procedural creation of music based on biologically
inspired musical evolution [7]. While this produces inter-
esting musical material, it takes considerable creative input
away from the composer. Hookpad is a composition tool
that utilizes music theory concepts to help composers con-
struct melodies and chord progressions that are known to
work well together in speciﬁc keys 1. The software, how-
ever, relies on a more thorough understanding of musical
composition theory with an interface that is not particu-
larly intuitive for beginners. Biles presented the GenJam
project, a real-time interactive improvisation tool for Jazz
music [4]. Its intent is to serve as a companion for exist-
ing Jazz musicians, requiring considerable expertise in the
genre. It is also restricted to the Jazz genre only. Levitin
et al. proposes alternative forms of creative input through
gestures, although we maintain that hardware accessibil-
ity, ease of use, and familiarity with the piano format will
be more improtant for aspiring composers [14]. Kitahara
et al. developed a system that automatically ”ﬁnishes” an
existing composition when a user makes edits [12]. This
system relies mostly on editing an existing piece and, un-
like Lumanote, does not focus on the process of writing a
song from scratch. Chuan et al., similarly, identiﬁed chord
progression of songs and suggests new chords to complete
the composition, but relies on an existing piece and does not
function in real-time [6]. Similar technologies, with similar
caveats, have also been applied for a composition’s melody
such as Tsuchiya et al.’s work that extracts a melody and
assists users in ﬁnishing edited melodies [18].
There also exist several digital chord suggestion systems.
Huang et al. present their ChordRipple interface, a system
that suggests a wide variety of appropriate chords to assist
novices in chord progression composition[11]. This system,
while useful, relies on a menu interface rather than allow-
ing users to receive suggestions as they play a keyboard in
real-time. Additionally, the system is built for chord pro-
gression suggestions but does not combine this with melody
note suggestions. Simon describes a musical accompani-
ment system, MySong, that suggests chords based on notes
that users sing into a microphone [17]. Users adjust pa-
rameters such as whether they wish to compose a ”sad”
or ”happy” song, and receive various chord suggestions for
them to include in their music. Like ChordRipple, however,
MySong does not provide suggestions in real-time nor does
it provide an instrument-based interface through which a
user can input notes. Additionally, its heavy reliance on
1Hookpad: https://www.hooktheory.com/hookpad/new
sliders to determine genre and mood might be considered
to be taking too much agency away from aspiring musicians.
Hardware LEDs on individual keys are a prominent feature
in products like Native Instruments’ Komplete Kontrol key-
boards,2, although the LEDs in this context are not used to
make any real-time note suggestions for composers.
2.3 Teaching Systems
Computerized interactive teaching tools have promisingly
emerged as low-cost, convenient solutions for learning about
music theory and instrument playing. Nilsson et al. has ex-
plored the integration of professional computer musical se-
quencing programs with the creative composition process of
children, and found that students were successful in devel-
oping music of sound form and structure [16]. Hickey em-
ployed the researcher-designed ”Music Mania” digital com-
position tool and found that unobtrusive recording sessions
for children resulted in more successful inspiration for stu-
dents over more closely guided tasks [10]. Burnard explores
the impact of digital composition tools and online teaching
courses on the existing pedagogy of instrument and mu-
sic theory teachings [5]. Burnard emphasizes the promise
of the viability of utilizing digital composition software for
teaching purposes, encouraging both teachers and pupils to
remain engaged and communicate both of their needs as re-
search in this ﬁeld continues. Klemenc et al. describes the
principles of color visualization of music that connects musi-
cal tones to shared and related colors in the color spectrum
[13]. This builds oﬀ of existing work from Bergstrom et
al. that explores alternative forms of visualizing chords [3].
Although this research also uses colors to identify harmo-
nious notes, its emphasis in teaching music theory produces
far more complex color schemes likely to be intimidating to
beginners without a teacher or music learning resource.
Xiao et al. presents MirrorFugue, a mirror-like interface
that displays the keyboard being played by an instructor for
students to imitate [19]. Teaching systems like Synthesia 3
use a scrolling-note interface to teach timing and notes of
existing songs, but also does not provide features to aid in
musical composition. This system largerly relies on an in-
structor’s input and does not support composition features.
These tools oﬀer a glimpse on the potential that interac-
tive digital composition tools might have on the learning
process. A digital composition tool that oﬀers teaching op-
portunities on the basics of authoring music could prove
invaluable.
3. DESCRIPTION OF LUMANOTESYSTEM
Lumanote is a real-time composition software tool that uses
the basic concepts of harmonizing musical notes with chords
and vice versa [8]. It is intended for use with any standard
MIDI controller such as an electronic keyboard, but has
also been programmed to take input from a mouse and/or
computer keyboard. We target inexperienced-to-beginner
piano players in order to best democratize the musical com-
position process. The system deliberately avoids providing
templates and examples so as to avoid potential issues of
comformity among aspiring musicians (as explored in the
work of Marsh et al.[15]). Lumanote’s web-based interface
displays a standard piano layout with a vertical Split Point
line that separates the left-hand ”chord” side form the right-
hand ”melody”side. A songwriter can start the composition
process by either inputting a base chord with their left hand,
or inputting a single melody note with their right. Luman-

pressed melody note on the right yields various suggestions for new melody notes.
ote then suggests a range of appropriate melody notes if
user input is a chord, or chord options if user input is a
melody note. Chord and melody not suggestions are made
according to basic music theory rules and the provided key
signature. For chords, a user is presented not with a sin-
gle chord, but rather a choice of various chords represented
by their base note. To choose a chord, the user keeps the
melody note pressed and presses one of the three suggested
chord base notes. Lumanote then recognizes the chosen
chord and expands the rest of the notes for that chord.
After having chosen both a base chord and the ﬁrst melody
note, the songwriter is presented with appropriate melody
notes that he or she can use for their composition. The
songwriter can, at any time, press a single melody note or
chord note and receive further appropriate notes based on
their input. Lumanote is intended to inspire composers by
letting them move from chord to chord and melody note
to melody note by constantly discovering new notes to play
oﬀ their input notes. The result is a piano interface that
always presents songwriters with a wide variety of options
through which to take their composition.
Lumanote color-codes the ”appropriateness”of these notes
and chords. Chord tones share the ﬁrst ”tier” of color label-
ing, whole-step passing tones the second ”tier” of labeling,
half-step passing tones the third, and 7th and 9th degrees
the ﬁnal tier. The actual colors displayed depend on which
color palette is chosen in the application setting. For exam-
ple, the ”Beginner” theme changes the color-coding so that
all in-scale notes of a chord are labeled the same shade of
blue. By contrast, the ”Expert” theme uses the full gamut
of ”tier” labeling, utilizing the rainbow color spectrum to
progressively label suggested notes from blue (most harmo-
nious) to red (least harmonious). Other coloring schemes
perform the same function but utilize shades of narrower
color gradients (such as from green to blue for the ”Rain-
forest” theme). The diﬀerent themes both accommodate
diﬀering user skill levels as well as a songwriter’s personal
taste.
It is important to emphasize that Lumanote does not
present a user with instructions. Rather, the system pro-
vides suggestions. Once the user chooses the notes and
chords of their choosing, the user is free to follow, disregard,
or alter the highlighted notes. For instance, all chords of a
note do not need to be pressed at once, or at all. A com-
poser might choose to only play two notes from a four-note
chord, or play three of them in an arpeggio pattern. Luman-
ote will recognize even individual notes to the left-hand side
of the Split Point as a chord, and still suggest harmonious
melody notes. Similarly, while Lumanote will never suggest
a completely out-of-scale melody note, if the user inputs one
the system will suggest the closest note that will allow the
composer to resolve the tension created by said note. This
would be useful for music in the Jazz or Blues genre.
Lumanote also includes a wide variety of features in-
cluding changing piano key widths, identifying scale notes
in each key signature and enabling microphone input that
identiﬁes the note being sung as the ”melody” note and sug-
gesting appropriate chords among others.
4. LED-BASED INTERFACE
A preliminary user study with inexperienced piano players
yielded valuable feedback on Lumanote’s interface, with one
of the most common points of critique being the diﬃculty in
mapping the suggested piano keys on the interface with the
electric keyboard they were playing. Although Lumanote
has a feature to change key widths, computer monitors are
manufactured with very high variations in sizes and resolu-
tions, and very rarely are wide enough to directly map the
keys of an 88-key or even 61-key piano keyboard with a 1:1
width ratio. However, we recognized Lumanote’s advantage
of requiring no custom hardware for its use, and wished to
preserve the spirit of the system’s design in its adaptabil-
ity to various MIDI controller inputs. This motivated us
to create a diﬀerent way of interfacing with the Lumanote
system with the following design requirements.
•Create a low-cost, adaptable peripheralthat can
be physically attached to an electronic keyboard.
•Preserve Lumanote’s intuitive note-suggestion sys-
tem without using a high-resolution computer moni-
tor.
•Choose a physical interface that does not interfere
with the pressing of keys, both in terms of the
keyboard mechanism and the user’s ﬁnger movement.
To that end, we have created a light-based interface that
utilizes a strip of LEDs that is attached directly above the
top of the keyboard keys and aligned to the keyboard notes.
4.1 System Description
The LED interface for Lumanote is controlled by an Ar-
duino Uno, which houses code that controls LED colors,
218

normal lighting conditions.
mapping of suggestions from the traditional Lumanote in-
terface, and LED-to-note assignments. We chose to use an
oﬀ-the-shelf LED strip to reduce the amount of required cus-
tom or expensive hardware. The Arduino Uno’s code maps
the keyboard notes to the corresponding light that is verti-
cally closest to a note. Mapping lights to a speciﬁc spacing
pattern (e.g., every third LED), would misalign notes with
lights and would essentially present the same interface-to-
keyboard mapping issue that is present in the original com-
puter screen interface. Our priority was mapping the lights
to the keys that were directly below them, which we be-
lieved to be the more intuitive mapping scheme for users.
Our mapping conforms to full-sized keyboard keys, so the
same LED strip can be used on any keyboard with full-
sized keys once the strip is aligned properly. Alignment
only requires that a single note be properly aligned to its
corresponding light, and all LEDs and notes to the right
and left of it will be aligned as well. The note suggestion
system present in the original Lumanote interface remains
virtually the same; the process of ﬁnding melody and chord
notes, as well as the actual note suggestions, are identical
across both interfaces.
4.2 Hardware Composition
The hardware layout of the LED interface is presented in
Figure 4. A USB-A cable is plugged into the Arduino Uno
for powering the Arduino, with pin 6 being used for the
transfer of data from a computer that runs the Lumanote
interface. Data transfer has been set at a baud rate of 4800,
allowing real-time note input and output with no additional
delay between the original monitor interface and the new
LED strip. A +5V DC power supply connects directly to
the LED strip for power to the lights. A 1000 uF capacitor is
added between the power supply and LED strip to prevent
the initial burst of current from damaging the lights, and a
470 ohm resistor is added between the Arduino’s data pin
and the LED strip to prevent data spikes from damaging
the ﬁrst LED in the strip.
Figure 4: Hardware schematic of the LED interface.
5. EV ALUATION
We believe that the note suggestion system has the most
potential for improvement among users who have little to
no piano-playing experience, and those consider themselves
beginner-to-intermediate musicians of other instruments. For
that reason, we sought to analyze the usage experience in a
22-person user study with participants inexperienced with
playing the piano, but who may have some musical back-
ground.
5.1 Study Description
We conducted a within-subjects user study that tested each
user under three diﬀerent scenarios: a composition with no
assistance from any note-suggestion interface, a composi-
tion with the assistance of the original computer monitor
interface, and a composition with the assistance of the new
LED-based interface. In order to counteract a potential
learning eﬀect, we asked half the participants to use the
monitor-based interface ﬁrst, and half the participants to
use the LED-based interface ﬁrst. For the second and third
scenarios, participants were given 4 minutes to compose an
original piece that lasted around 10 seconds. At the end
of the 4 minutes, the composition was recorded. Partici-
pants were given as many times as they wished to record
their composition, since we did not intend to capture their
live music-playing skills but rather the composition itself.
However, the song was not allowed to change in between
recording attempts.
A post-study questionnaire was distributed to partici-
pants, asking about any prior musical experience, a series of
Likert-scale questions about their opinion on the usefulness
of the interfaces and the note-suggestion system, as well as
which interface they preferred.
Figure 5: Study order and distribution of partici-
pants.
We recruited 3 experienced musicians to judge the user
compositions without knowledge of which interface the par-
ticipants utilized.
•Judge 1 has 15 years experience of playing electric
and acoustic guitar, and 2 years of playing drums.
This judge has been composing songs for around 5
years, and improvising music for around 3 years. They
have thorough understanding of scales, (minor, major,
pentatonic minor/major, blues), modes, ideal chord
progressions for various genres, extension chords, and
modulation between key signatures among other con-
cepts
•Judge 2 has played percussion instruments for 11
years, including keyboards and drums. This judge’s
composition expertise is mostly rhythmic, creating sev-
eral original ensembles for drums and arranged several
for mallets and keyboards. They have 7 years of for-
mal education in music and has judged auditions for
a university music group for 4 years.
•Judge 3 has has 15 years of playing the piano and
has experience with guitar chords. Throughout those
15 years, this judge has composed short melodies, has
219
been learning music theory, and can comfortably sight-
read sheet music. They also frequently improvise with
other musicians for recreation.
All judges were asked to rank the compositions individually:
all compositions from the no-interface scenario, all compo-
sitions with the assistance of the monitor-based interface,
and all compositions of the LED-based interface. They were
also asked to rank the composition of each user across every
scenario. Judges were not told which scenario pertained to
which, if any, interface assistance the users had.
Judge ranking was based on a broad deﬁnition of qual-
ity. A presence of rhythm, harmonious notes/chords, and
a general sense of musicality were the main components of
judging quality. We avoided strict measures like ”notes per
minute” to avoid favoritism to faster songs over slower ones,
or giving preference to certain musical styles and genres.
5.2 Results
5.2.1 User Responses
The user questionnaire and its responses are summarized
in Figures 6 and 7, and Table 1. The post-study question-
naire consisted of two parts: questions on the user’s ex-
perience with playing and composing music, and questions
based on their experiences with both interfaces. Although
36% of users had 4 years or more of instrument-playing ex-
perience, only 9% had any experience at all in composing
songs. Only 6 participants had ever played a piano and
characterized themselves as inexperienced, and those with
previous musical experience noted that their skill in their
respective instrument did not transfer to their piano playing
during the study.
Responses to interface questions were on a 5-point Likert
scale, with 1 being ”Very Diﬃcult” or ”No Help at All”, and
5 being ”Very Easy” or ”Very Helpful”. Finally, we asked
which of the two presented interfaces they preferred. 86%
of users preferred the LED strip over the monitor-based in-
terface, noting that they vastly preferred the lights marking
the suggested notes more directly onto the physical keys.
They expressed more diﬃculty in having to ”count” keys in
the original monitor interface.
Figure 6: Information on musical experience of user
study participants.
This demonstrates a clear preference for the LED-based
interface. 2 of the 3 participants who preferred the monitor-
based interface had previous experience with playing a pi-
ano, and cited the monitor interface’s depiction of piano
keys as the main reason for their preference. These par-
ticipants noted having little issue with mapping the keys
depicted in the monitor to the keys on the musical key-
board. The 19 participants who preferred the LED inter-

ber of Users)

face, however, reported trouble with the same task of map-
ping the notes suggested on the monitor with the keys in
front of them. They preferred the close proximity of the
LEDs clearly labeling the actual key that should be pressed,
and they did not mind the irregular spacing between LEDs
for key suggestions. Some users expressed preference for
LED interface’s potential portability, since it only requires
a small strip that can be attached to any standard-sized
keyboard rather than a computer monitor.
Figure 7: Post-study questionnaire responses of sys-
tem and interface experience.
5.2.2 Judge Rankings
Judge rankings can be seen summarized in Tables 2 and 3.
Because the LED and monitor interfaces present the same
information to the user, we initially hypothesized that the
actual quality of user compositions would not diﬀer greatly
regardless of which of the two interfaces users personally
preferred. However, in practice we did notice a small in-
crease in composition quality with creations assisted by the
LED interface; Judge 1 ranked 12 of 22 (55%) of LED
compositions as the ”best” of the three for each user, and
Judge 2 ranked 15 of 22 (68%) of LED compositions as
the ”best”. Conversely, Judge 3 ranked 15 of 22 (68%) of
monitor compositions as the ”best”. By contrast, all com-
positions with no interface assistance performed the worst
across all judges: Judge 1 ranked all 22 no-interface com-
positions as the worst for each participant, Judge 2 ranked
21 of 22 as the worst, and Judge 3 ranked 18 of 22 as the
worst.
We calculated the correlation coeﬃcient averages of all
three judges with respect to their rankings for Scenarios 2
(LED-assisted composition) and Scenario 3 (Monitor-assisted
composition) and whether said interface was played ﬁrst or
second. We found no statistical correlation between how
highly ranked the songs were and whether they played with
an interface ﬁrst or second. Average correlation coeﬃcient
for all three judges for Scenario 2 was 0.0407 and for Sce-
nario 3 was -0.0454.
Although the LED compositions performed slightly bet-
ter with the judges, we can conﬁdently conclude that the
Lumanote system yields considerably better musical com-
positions among users with little musical composition ex-
perience. The outcomes also suggests that using the LED

interface results in compositions of at least comparable qual-
ity with those composed from the monitor-based interface.
Furthermore, we can identify participants’ strong preference
for the LED interface.
6. FUTURE WORK AND CONCLUSION
We intend to further iterate on this LED interface that will
use an oﬀ-the-shelf strip of LEDs with adjustable spacing
between them. This would allow every LED to be used and
perfectly aligned to keys, even for keyboards with narrower
or wider keys. We also intend to implement a note record-
ing feature, since several users expressed a wish to be able
to remember which notes and chords they chose as they
composed. This would also allow them to compose a more
complicated piece that they may not be able to play live
due to their skill level.
Lumanote’s note-suggestion system for both chords and
melody note allows users of varying skill levels to produce
musical compositions that follow music theory rules on tone
harmony. Strong preliminary results yielded some insights
on the shortcomings of the note-suggestion interface when
displayed on a standard computer monitor, including mul-
tiple comments expressing diﬃculty in mapping the piano
interface as shown on the monitor to the musical keyboard
they were playing. This motivated the creation of an LED-
based interface that preserves the note-suggestion system
but communicates it through a physical peripheral designed
to be attached to the keyboard itself. A more extensive user
study followed, ﬁnding clear improvements with the note
suggestion system over no assistance, and ﬁnding that users
strongly preferred the LED interface. With a clear path for
improvement, we believe that Lumanote can democratize
the creation of musically sound songs without relying on
minimal-input procedural generation. We believe Luman-
ote can help develop an aspiring musician’s creative process
and identity.
