ABSTRACT
We present a novel robotic violinist that is designed to play Carnatic music - a music 
system popular in the southern part of India. The robot plays the D string and uses a 
single finger mechanism inspired by the Chitravina - a fretless Indian lute. A 
fingerboard traversal system with a dynamic finger tip apparatus enables the robot to 
play gamakas - pitch based embellishments in-between notes, which are at the core of 
Carnatic music. A double roller design is used for bowing which reduces space, 
produces a tone that resembles the tone of a conventional violin bow, and facilitates 
super human playing techniques such as infinite bowing. The design also enables the 
user to change the bow hair tightness to help capture a variety of performing 
techniques in different musical styles. Objective assessments and subjective listening 
tests were conducted to evaluate our design, indicating that the robot can play 
gamakas in a realistic manner and thus, can perform Carnatic music.

Introduction
Carnatic Music is a system of music commonly associated with southern part of India. 
The main emphasis of the system is vocal music, known as the ’Gayaki’ style [1]. A 
notable trait of the genre is the use of microtonal variations, where musical notes 
(Swaras) of phrases are almost always performed with ornamentation called 
‘gamakas’. A raga is a melodic framework akin to a melodic mode, in Indian classical 
music [2]. Unlike western music where the modes/scales are only defined by the notes 
and the key, in Carnatic music, the gamakas are integral parts of asserting a raga.
For a robot to play Carnatic music, it needs to be able to perform swaras with 
gamakas. In a typical Carnatic music concert, the violinist accompanying the lead 
artist follows the lead melody and improvises in real-time with variations around it in 
segments such as alapana, swara kalpana, niraval and thaanam [3]. Thus, a robotic 
violinist designed for Carnatic music needs to be able to analyze audio phrases and

replicate the performance, as expected by a human violinist accompanying in a 
concert. Since Carnatic music is vocal centric, it requires bow changes to follow 
syllable change in the lyrics. The robot should not only follow the swara variations but 
also the dynamics and bow changes by modulating the bowing speed and the hair 
pressure on the string.
Considering these requirements, we present a novel design of a robotic violinist that 
plays Carnatic music1. It is shown in Figure 1. Building such a robot has many 
applications in music production and education. Western composers have various tools 
such as keyboards and VSTs to experiment and listen to how their piece would sound 
before inviting musicians to perform. For Carnatic music no such tools are available 
that supports gamakas. The composers are forced to learn keyboard playing 
techniques that uses pitch bends and portamento to play gamakas. Software based 
emulations (such as VSTs) are hard to accurately model the limitations of violin playing 
and the timbre that the real instrument produces. Using our robot in these scenarios 
can solve these difficulties. They can also be used to teach Carnatic violin. Robots 
don’t get fatigue like humans and they will make learning more accessible to students. 
Robot performances in this genre will increase popularity and create awareness about 
Carnatic music among international audience.

Related Work
Previous work in robotic musicianship for violin performance has largely focused on 
the replication of Western Classical music and on playing pre-written sequences of 
discrete notes. Such systems do not address expressive performance techniques such 
as glissandi or gamakas. For example, the Hupfeld Phonoliszt-Violina [4] and Violano 
Virtuoso [5] feature a distinct approach to sound generation, yet they are limited to 
hard-coded piano rolls and are unable to play glissandi. One of the popular builds was 
the Toyoto’s violin playing robot [6]. It is an andro-humanoid robot that holds and plays 
the violin just like human violinists. Their intention was to showcase it as a general 
purpose social robot and violin playing was just a demonstration of it. Seth Goldstein’s 
Ro-Bow [7] addresses microtonal playing using a movable finger mechanism with a 
design that rotates the violin for string shifts. However, this design does not modify the 
bowing position according to the left hand movement affecting the tonal quality of the 
sound produced. The Ro-Bow also requires a large apparatus around the violin, which 
is not practical in a Carnatic concert setting. The idea of kensei from Shibuya, K. [8] is 
an interesting concept where the system listens to the output to improve its sound 
quality by adjusting the bowing parameters, modeling how humans play the 
instrument. However, their system was not designed with performance in mind. It is 
hampered by the left hand which uses a three finger mechanism that is mounted 
statically, limiting the robot from playing higher note positions and other scales. It also 
lacks left hand and bowing arm coordination.
Design
Our robotic violinist design is divided into two sub sections - the Fingerboard Traversal 
and Bowing. Design decisions have been carefully made considering the requirements 
of the genre it is intended to perform.
Fingerboard Traversal
The fingerboard traversal design is inspired by the human left hand movements 
(throughout this paper, we will also use the term "left hand" to denote the fingerboard 
traversal). Violinists use their elbow joints for larger movements and use their fingers 
to stop the string. We designed our system similarly.

As explained in the introduction section, the design needs to facilitate playing 
gamakas. In technical terms, the robot needs to be able to modulate the pitch in the 
continuous domain over time. Figure 2 depicts the side view of an acoustic violin.  
represents the scale length, which is the distance from the bridge to the Nut. The red 
arrow depicts an example finger position, playing a major second.  is the distance of 
the finger position from the bridge. The fingerboard traversal system should be able to 
stop the string at any point on the string such that . By varying , we can vary 
the string length, thus changing the pitch. Assuming an equal temperament scale for 
simplicity, the pitch position is a function of 12th root of 2. For a given open string 
tuning, the distance from the bridge  can be computed for any fret position  using 
Equation 1.
Our first goal was to make the robot play the arohanam 2 and avarohanam 3 of the 
raga Shankarabharanam with gamakas. With D as the root, the raga is equivalent to a 
D-Major scale in western music. With this intention, our robot was designed to play 
one string (D string). The traversal is implemented with a 300 mm linear slider. The 
linear slider is driven by the Maxon EC45 70W Brush-Less DC (BLDC) Motor with the 
EPOS4 50/5 Positioning controller using a belt. The other end of the belt has an 
auxiliary encoder to track the finger position in real-time. Its function will be detailed 
in auxiliary encoder section.

Our initial design used four hold points to strap the system to the violin. Specifically, 
the scroll, the neck, the fingerboard top (near the bridge) and the body. We 3d-printed 
all the components using ABS plastic. Our experiments showed a significant decrease 
in noise when the fingerboard and body holders were removed without affecting the 
stability. To further reduce the noise from the mechanical systems, foam padding was 
added to all the contact points of the structure. The violin’s sound masks the residual 
noise of the system making the noise inaudible during performance.
Figure 3 also shows the neck and the scroll support frames for the left hand 
movement. The neck support is fastened used a hex screw. The height of this structure 
is designed in such a way that the violin’s string would lay parallel to the ground. The 
scroll support is designed to rest the motor holder on the scroll. No screws were 
needed for the scroll support since the encoder and motor holder counteract each 
other to hold the system in place. Since only one screw holds the entire system, it is 
easy to remove the violin from the robot to replace strings, tune it, etc.

String Stopping
The string pressing system uses a single finger design, inspired by the Indian 
instrument - Chitravina [9]. Chitravina is a popular 21 stringed, fretless lute with 
history going back to at-least 2000 years. The instrument is played using a slide similar 
to a Hawaiian guitar, demonstrating that gamakas in Carnatic music can be performed 
with just one finger.
Figure 4 shows the 3d model of the finger press actuator system. The "finger" itself is 
driven by a MG90 micro servo motor with metal gears coupled by a rack and pinion 
mechanism and a dynamic finger tip. The finger tip is designed to adapt to the 
fingerboard curvature. Since the surface normal vector of the fingerboard is different 
at every point, an adaptable finger tip is necessary to have the most efficient press. 
The finger has roller bearings to minimize friction while sliding over the support 
structure. The finger tip is resin printed to allow for flexibility while pressing the 
string. Further, a silicon coating is added to the bottom side. The silicon coating 
brought the tip’s damping factor close to that of human skin, thus improving the tonal 
quality.

Bowing
Bowing speed, bowing force, and sound point are the three factors relevant to bowing 
that determine the sound quality of a violin [10]. Figure 5 shows our bowing 
mechanism design, addressing these parameters using three degrees of freedom:
Roller Wheels - moves the bow hair
Bow Pitch - adjusts the bow pressure
Bow Position - adjusts the bowing position along the string

The whole system is mounted on a wooden frame that was removed from this figure for 
clarity.
There are various techniques by which a string of the violin can be excited. Some 
conventional methods include an actual violin bow, or wheels as in the hurdy gurdy 
[11]. We chose a similar design since a conventional violin bow introduces a few 
limitations: A full size bow occupies more space and makes it harder to implement 
playing techniques such as infinite bowing. Moreover it requires more degrees of 
freedom and power due to the dimensions of a bow.
Roller Wheels
We experimented with different bowing mechanisms to find the timbre that sounded 
close to a conventional acoustic bowing. The trials included different wheel designs, 
including a single roller wheel design and a double roller wheel design. The single 
roller wheel design trials included Wood, Acrylic and Plastic (ABS).
The double roller wheel design shown in Figure 5 has 2 roller wheels. Nylon thread is 
spun around these wheels to form a belt like structure. Rosin is applied on the thread 
to get the necessary friction for bowing. These threads move across the string to excite

it and produce sound. This mechanism is loosely inspired by Tufts Robotic Violin 
Project [12]. One of the wheel is also driven by a Maxon EC45 BLDC motor whose 
speed of rotation is closed loop velocity controlled. It controls the speed of movement 
of the bow hair on the string which is analogous to bowing faster/slower on a 
conventional bow.
This double roller wheel design was selected as our final design since it produces a 
similar hair tension to that of a real violin bow hair.
Pressure
The hair pressure exerted on the string is varied using a Dynamixel AX12-A Servo. 
Since these servos can be daisy chained, it is advantageous to use them to simplify 
wiring. It is mounted on the "Servo 1" mount as shown in Figure 5.
This degree of freedom also controls the bow hair contact with the string, replicating 
the manner in which humans place the bow on and off the string. Since the bowing 
system is static with respect to the violin, we used a combination of feed forward and 
feedback system for pressure modulation. Left hand position tracking is used as 
feedback to adjust the pressure when playing higher finger positions. We tuned the 
angle of the servo to obtain the required pressure.
Position
The bow position on the string is dependent on the finger position on the fingerboard. 
The higher the position of the finger on a string, the closer the bow needs to be to the 
bridge to produce a rich intonation and tone.

We implemented the bow position modulation using a slider-crank linkage mechanism. 
This degree of freedom is also driven by a Dynamixel AX12-A Servo. Figure 7 shows 
the slider crank mechanism. The point  denotes the top of the fingerboard and the 
point  denotes the position of the bridge. When the left hand finger plays higher note 
positions, the bow needs to move towards . The maximum distance of the bow can be 
 and the minimum is . The displacement is denoted as . For any given distance 
, we need to know the angle  to rotate the servo to. The length of the crank is  
and the length of the connecting rod is .
The total displacement of the bow from the motor is given by  for a given angle 
When  the above equation can be approximated to

 Practically, this approximation does not lead to noticeable effect in tone quality while 
saving a lot of computational power.
The actual design is depicted in Figure 6. The roller wheel system is mounted on a 100 
mm linear rail constraining the movement to only one axis. An adjustment multiplier is 
used when mapping the finger position to the total displacement. This value is tuned to 
obtain the desired tone.
Hair Tightness Tuning
One notable practice among violinists is adjusting the bow hair tightness depending on 
the style of the piece. High energy and fast paced music generally require high bow 
hair tension to make the bowing more responsive and bright while a low energy or a 
sad piece require low bow hair tension. The double roller wheel design enables the 
robot to change the bow hair tension similar to a conventional bow. This is not possible 
with other bowing techniques such as the single wheel designs mentioned in Roller 
Wheels section. Figure 5 shows the hair tightness adjuster which can be manually 
adjusted using the screw, which in turn adjusts the height of the bearing. This affects 
the tension of the bow hair.
Hardware
The main control of the robot is done through a Raspberry Pi 4, which coordinates all 
parts of the system.

The communication and data flow architecture is depicted in Figure 8. The Raspberry 
pi does not control the actuators directly but through their respective controllers. The 
Pi communicates with the Fingerboard traversal EPOS4 Controller, Bow Roller Wheel 
EPOS4 Controller and Arduino MKR Zero Micro Controller. The controllers denoted in 
blue represent the EPOS4 which control the EC45 BLDCs. The Arduino MKR Zero 
micro controller uses a powerful ARM Cortex M0+ Chip, operating at 3.3V logic level. 
The Pi communicates with the micro controller via I2C communication protocol. It is 
connected to the first EPOS4 controller via USB while the other EPOS4 controller is 
daisy chained to use CAN-bus protocol. The Micro Controller handles the finger servo 
(MG90) through PWM. It controls the Dynamixel AX12-A servos for the bow pressure 
and position modulation as discussed in fingerboard traversal and bowing sections 
through serial communication. The micro controller also handles data acquisition from 
the auxiliary encoder. The MG90 and the AX12-A were adequate for the respective 
DoFs. They also have a low noise when used for small rotations. This saves a lot on 
Figure 8

14
cost and also the ease of controlling them when compared to using an industrial level 
BLDCs for these DoFs.
Auxiliary Encoder
Apart from the encoders embedded in the motors, we installed an auxiliary rotary 
encoder since our tests showed that the embedded encoder data retrieval did not 
support realtime operation. The setup of the encoder is shown in Figure 3. The BLDC 
motors use their embedded encoders for position and velocity control for left hand 
movement and bow wheel roll respectively. The auxiliary encoder is used to retrieve 
the current position of the finger in realtime, sampled at 200 Hz. The finger position 
information is used to adjust the bow position, bow pressure and finger tip height from 
the fingerboard.
The amount of excitation required is dependent on the point at which the string is 
excited. To achieve tonal consistency, bowing near the fingerboard requires less 
excitation compared to bowing near the bridge. One way to counteract this is by 
modulating the bow pressure, so that pressure exerted increases slightly as the bow 
position becomes close to the bridge.
Bow position modulation is detailed in the bow position section.
In a conventional violin, the string height is not uniform along the fingerboard. The 
height of the string near the nut is smaller than the top of the fingerboard (bridge 
side). Thus the finger tip’s height needs to be corrected for this displacement while 
playing to have the finger press grip consistent across the length of the string. The 
position information from the auxiliary encoder is used to adjust the height of the 
finger tip (i.e. the distance from the finger tip to the string) both while playing and in 
OFF positions.
Software
The main application that runs on the Raspberry pi and the Arduino firmware are 
programmed in C++4.
Input data structure
We implemented the software to use two types of inputs. The first input type is a series 
of fret numbers, time and bow change indices. The fret number is represented by float 
value from 0.0 to 15.0 where 0.0 represents open string, 1.0 represents the minor 
second, etc. The time index represents the amount of time in seconds in which the fret

position needs to be held for. Bow change is represented by a boolean array which 
indicates whether a bow change is required. An example of playing a phrase in raga 
kalyani is shown below. 
  is the phrase performed with spurita gamaka [13].
The second input type is a JSON file, which was chosen as an effective format to allow 
the robot to interpret and learn different features from an audio recording of human 
violin performers. The JSON file contains 3 sets of arrays - Pitch, Bow and Amplitude. 
Each Pitch and Amplitude values are  5.805 ms apart. The pitch values are key 
normalized and contain the corresponding amplitude which ranges between 0.0 and 
1.0. Silence or rest is denoted with a negative pitch value. The bow array contains 
index values to indicate where the bow direction needs to be changed. We wrote a 
python script to obtain all these values from a violin recording. A rule based bow 
change detection algorithm is implemented to detect the bow changes from a violin 
recording. To obtain the pitch values, we used the pYin pitch detection algorithm [14] 
from the librosa library [15] windowed at 2048 samples with a hop size of 256. We use 
the JSON format input when we want the robot to perform a phrase by example from a 
human playing.
Evaluation
We evaluated our system using objective and subjective metrics. Bow Position and 
Pressure Modulation were evaluated using objective measurements. The robot’s ability 
to play expressive gamakas was evaluated through an expert listening test.
Bow Position and Pressure Modulation
To obtain a rich human-like tone, we need to have a uniform excitation of the string. As 
explained in the bow pressure and position sections, the vertical distance of the string 
from the fingerboard is higher near the bridge than the nut. Thus, adjusting the 
position and pressure based on the position of the left hand is necessary for achieving 
a consistently good tone. To evaluate the effectiveness of the bow position and 
pressure modulation, we programmed the robot to play the D Major Scale up to the 
playable limit of the robot on the string. We used the Root Mean Square (RMS) energy 
Fret Positions=[2,1,2,4,3,4,6,5,6,8,7,8,9]
Time=[1,0.1,0.9,1,0.1,0.9,1,0.1,0.9,1,0.1,0.9,2]

and the spectral flatness [16] as features to evaluate the loudness and tonality 
respectively. Spectral flatness measures the tonality level in the audio signal. The 
higher this value, the noisier and less-tonal the signal is.  Figure 9 shows the RMS 
energy and the spectral flatness with and without bow position and pressure 
modulation.
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Design of Hathaani - A Robotic Violinist for Carnatic Music
17
In Figure 9, a line - shown in orange, is fit to the data points to show the loudness 
trend as the finger position increases. Figure 9.a shows that without bow position and

pressure modulation, the loudness drops at higher left hand positions. Figure 9.b 
shows that the energy stays mostly consistent when using the pressure and position 
modulation. We attribute the troughs in the graph to bow changes, and the 
inconsistent note peak at  ~500th sample in Figure 9.b by the strong resonances of the 
note A on that particular violin. This inconsistency is not evident in Figure 9.a because 
the loudness drops down at that finger position. We confirmed this explanation by 
evaluating ten different instances of the performance with all of them showing a 
similar trend.
Figure 9.c and Figure 9.d show the spectral flatness plot with and without bow 
pressure and position modulation respectively. The peaks can be attributed to the left 
hand movement. It is evident that the tonality decreases as the left hand moves higher 
on the fingerboard, while when the modulations are active, the tonality is well 
maintained.
It can be observed that the bow change peaks are wider when using the pressure and 
position modulation. This can be explained by the motor noise introduced when the 
modulation is in action. The adjustment parameters in the bow pressure and position 
sections are tuned to obtain the best tone without introducing too much of the actuator 
noise.
Expert Listening Test
We evaluate the effectiveness of the robot in playing gamakas by inviting six Carnatic 
music experts to participate in a listening test. The artists have at least 15 years of 
experience in performing Carnatic music concerts and have in-depth knowledge of 
Carnatic music theory - especially in understanding and interpreting gamakas.
In designing the experiment, we followed the book - Sangita Sampradaya Pradarsini 
(SSP) [13] by Subbarama Dikshitar, which is one of the seminal text books for gamaka 
classification and notation. The original telugu version of the book was first published 
in 1904. It was one of the first attempts for notating and classifying gamakas that are 
close to how the gamakas are rendered today. From the SSP book, we chose seven 
popularly used gamakas that are relevant to violin playing. These are Kampita, 
Sphurita, Tirupa / Nokku, Ahata, Vali, Ullasita and Kurula. The audio samples used in 
the listening test can be found at Hathaani-audio-samples.
It is to be noted that the gamakas classified in SSP have some overlaps. For instance, 
Vali gamaka often contains Ullasita or Kampita gamakas in it’s rendition. It is 
impractical to construct phrases with just one gamaka type. The recorded phrases 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Design of Hathaani - A Robotic Violinist for Carnatic Music

contain a predominent gamaka type with other supporting gamakas. The listening test 
consisted of three sections as described below.
Sarali Varisai
The first section tests the ability of the robot to play basics of Carnatic music - the first 
sarali varisai [17] in 4 different ragas. As part of the test, participants were asked to 
guess the raga that is being played by the robot. A 5 point, 0.5 increment scale was 
used to rate each of the performance on the basis of pitching / intonation, timbre / 
tone, quality of bowing, right-left hand coordination and overall clarity. Overall, the 
participants were able to guess all the ragas in this section correctly. The mean and 
standard deviation of the combined scores from participants is given in Table 1.
Table 1
Sarali varisai scores
Gamaka Identification
In the second section participants listened to 16 audio recordings of short robotic 
generated phrases. Each phrase was about three seconds long containing one or more 
gamakas from the seven chosen types. The participants were asked to list all the 
gamakas present in each phrase and rate the performance. Participants were also 
asked to rate authenticity of gamaka, which measures how accurate each gamaka was 
performed. The participants were able to spot the predominant gamakas most of the 
time. Table 2 shows the participants’ entry for each question. The first column lists the 
predominent gamaka(s) present in each phrase.

It can be seen that participants had no ambiguity with guessing the Spurita gamaka. It 
is notable that in some cases, the participants tagged Ullasita when tagging Ahata 
(Ravai). This suggests that a second robotic finger may be necessary since the quick 
movement of the left hand to play Ahata could have been mis-interpreted as Ullasita. 
The Vali gamaka was most often confused for other gamakas. This can be attributed to 
the fact that Vali involves playing shades of multiple swaras. Thus, it contains other 
gamakas associated with it.
Though SSP is one of the standard references used by researchers today, it has a few 
limitations. Experts who took the survey mentioned that though these gamakas are in 
use even today, their type nomenclatures are rather archaic. The gamaka 
classifications are not mutually exclusive. This explains the reason for mis-tagging of 
gamakas in some cases as shown in Table 2. Participants also mentioned that the book 
explains gamaka techniques as used by the Veena [18] and therefore it is difficult to 
visualize the same techniques in other instruments.
The mean and standard deviation of the combined scores from the participants is given 
in Table 3.

raga. We recorded characteristic phrases of 11 different ragas - Neelambari, Bhairavi, 
Arabhi, Kanada, Dhanyasi, Mohanam, Thodi, Sahana, Saveri, Anandhabhairavi and 
Sindhubhairavi. None of the phrases contained the complete arohanam and 
avarohanam. This means that not all the notes of each raga were revealed. Thus the 
participants needed to rely on the gamaka to guess the raga. For instance, the phrase 
used for the raga sindhubhairavi is | p D P d n s r G r S R S | 5. These swaras are also 
valid in Thodi but they differ by the gamakas used to perform the phrase. The 
participants were able to guess all the 11 ragas correctly. The mean and standard 
deviation of the combined scores from the participants for this section is given in Table 
4.

Conclusion
We presented a novel design of a robotic violin player which can play Carnatic music. 
The left hand design allows the robot to play any position on a string, which supports 
the production of gamakas. The robot’s dynamic finger tip is designed to adapt to the 
curvature of the fingerboard. The bowing mechanism has three degrees of freedom. It 
uses a double roller wheel design with nylon threads spun around the wheels that 
move across the string to excite it. The two other degrees of freedom vary the pressure 
exerted and the position of bowing on the string. The bow design also enables the user 
to change the tightness of the bow hair which is required when performing different 
styles of music within the genre. Expert listening tests were performed with six 
professional musicians to evaluate the effectiveness of the robot in playing gamakas.

The participants guessed all the ragas correctly, suggesting that the robot can play 
gamakas, which are the core of Carnatic music.
Future Work
We intend to extend the robot to play multiple strings, to produce better timbre, and to 
increase playing range. While the robot can play the selected seven gamakas with one 
finger satisfactorily, some gamakas, such as Spurita would sound better with multiple 
fingers. We, therefore, plan to add at least one more robotic finger in the next design. 
The bow pressure modulation in the current design is a combination of feedforward 
and feedback control with feedback only from the auxiliary encoder. We plan to add 
force feedback to the design and hope it would improve the bowing quality and the 
produced timbre.
On the software side, the robot currently only performs pre-recorded sequences and 
cannot interpret gamakas and improvise. We, therefore, plan to implement an 
interpreter system that synthesizes gamakas given the swaras and ragas.
