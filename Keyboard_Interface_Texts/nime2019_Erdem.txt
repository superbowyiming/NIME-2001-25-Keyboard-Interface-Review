ABSTRACT
This paper describes the process of developing a shared in-
strument for music–dance performance, with a particular
focus on exploring the boundaries between standstill vs mo-
tion, and silence vs sound. The piece Vrengt grew from the
idea of enabling a true partnership between a musician and
a dancer, developing an instrument that would allow for ac-
tive co-performance. Using a participatory design approach,
we worked with soniﬁcation as a tool for systematically ex-
ploring the dancer’s bodily expressions. The exploration
used a “spatiotemporal matrix,” with a particular focus on
sonic microinteraction. In the ﬁnal performance, two Myo
armbands were used for capturing muscle activity of the
arm and leg of the dancer, together with a wireless headset
microphone capturing the sound of breathing. In the paper
we reﬂect on multi-user instrument paradigms, discuss our
approach to creating a shared instrument using soniﬁcation
as a tool for the sound design, and reﬂect on the performers’
subjective evaluation of the instrument.

1. INTRODUCTION
In today’s experimental performance scene, many musicians
are exploring performance practices that approach dance,
and many dancers are working with interactive music sys-
tems. A challenge in such exploration, however, is funda-
mentally diﬀerent intentions ranging from particular em-
bodied practices [36]. For a musician, the sound is the pri-
mary focus of attention, and the movements needed to pro-
duce the sound (the sound-producing and sound-modifying
actions) are the result of that aim. For a dancer, on the

other hand, the movements are the primary focus of atten-
tion, and any sonic output is secondary. It is therefore not
surprising that the dancer in an interactive context does not
intuitively render her movements into instrumental actions
for active sound-making, but rather maintains her regular
dance-actions inﬂuencing the sound generation in an ab-
stract way. Similarly, the musician either takes the role of
the composer without active involvement, or, as the per-
former enacting her own instrument.
In this paper, we continue our exploration of working be-
tween dance and music, this time focusing on co-performance
on a “shared” instrument. As opposed to creating a system
for interactive dance, we wanted to develop what is experi-
enced as one, coherent instrument that enables a true part-
nership for the musician and dancer. The challenge, then,
is to what extent the dancer is able to adopt musical in-
tentions on top of her movement practice, and whether the
composer–performer can waive the control of performing
while still “playing together”?
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Between the conscious and the unconscious
Experiencing the body as part of your subjective presence
rather than a mere series of shapes on the stage, is described
by dancers as “being in your body” [34]. This is often the
result of skill acquisition, which Dreyfus has argued is a con-
186
tinuum of less and less processing information at a cognitive
level [7]. In other words, we operate more intuitively and
less consciously as we gain expertise. In music, such skill
acquisition is often based on proprioceptive relationships
between a musician and instrument [31]. In fact, most hu-
man movement is found in the span between conscious and
unconscious. That is, we unconsciously execute a number
of physiological and biological processes for a single, delib-
erate task [3]. This is something that has been explored in
the context of music–dance performances under the labeling
sonic microinteraction [18, 16].
2.2 Multi-user Instruments
Multi-user instruments have become more popular in recent
years, but this is still a fairly unexplored territory. Histor-
ically, there are several examples of shared musical instru-
ment practice, in particular in the form of four-handed piano
works from the 18 th and 19th centuries [13]. At that time,
the shared performance allowed for forced intimacy in a so-
cial space, serving also as away of bridging the gaps of skills
and social grades [5]. In the 20 th century, experimental
composers, such as John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen,
explored the musical possibilities gained by exploiting the
complex relationships between multiple users [19]. But it
was ﬁrst with digital technologies that the idea of design-
ing instruments speciﬁcally to work together on and around
the same musical content took oﬀ [20]. Some notable ex-
amples from the NIME community include the Tooka [10]
and Reactable [21], and a number of more recent web-based
instruments may also be classiﬁed as multi-user.
2.3 Interactive Dance
The second author is proﬁcient in release-based training,
which is a contemporary dance technique that focuses on
performing tasks with least amount of muscle exertion by
using the gravity [25]. A challenge in an interactive dance
context is to design an interface that allows the dancer con-
trol of the sound, but without sacriﬁcing the existing perfor-
mance technique [38]. It is particularly important to allow
for ﬂow procedures, in which there is an immediate and
causal feedback, yet at the same time a “sense of discov-
ery” [4]. For that reason we have been interested in using
soniﬁcation as a tool, since it is often thought of as a more
“objective” approach to rendering sound in response to data
than more creatively based sound design [15]. There are nu-
merous examples of the use of soniﬁcation in dance-related
motion analysis [28], dance pedagogy and education [11, 14],
supporting the development of interactive dance pieces [23,
18] as well as assisting dancers with disabilities [22, 29]. In
our case the soniﬁcation is not the end result, but rather a
tool used as part of the creative process.
3. CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
The main idea of Vrengt was that of creating a body–
machine instrument in which the dancer would interact with
her body and the musician with a set of physical controllers.
As such, it may seem as a quite normal setup for a music–
dance performance, except that we did not want the dancer
and musician to work in separate “layers,” but rather co-
control the same sonic and musical parameters. This was
conceptually diﬀerent than they had done before. The de-
velopment was done using a participatory design approach,
combining a series of analyses, conversations, recording ses-
sions, and subjective evaluations during the development
of the instrument and ﬁnal performance. As such, the en-
tire process was very integrated, and both the musician and
dancer felt a complete ownership of the ﬁnal “product.”
3.1 Interaction Concept
Our project grew from the concept of human micromotion,
the tiniest producible and observable motion. These can
be used in sonic microinteraction, which are found in most
performances on acoustic instruments, but arguably not so
often in digital musical instruments [17]. We start from
capturing the “smallest components” of the dancer’s bodily
exertions in the form of muscle signals and breathing, ex-
plore them through soniﬁcation, and then gradually build
the entire system up from there.
Electromyogram (EMG) is a complex signal that repre-
sents the electrical currents generated during neuromuscu-
lar activities. It is able to report little or non-visible “in-
puts” (intentions), which may not always result in overt
body movements [43]. EMG is therefore highly relevant for
exploring involuntary micromotion. The ﬁrst author has
been exploring what a muscle interface can add to the ex-
isting interaction paradigms of traditional instrumentalists
[9]. “Playing with muscles” can enhance the engagement
with the instrument [30], which should be considered at the
top of the design hierarchy [32].
3.2 Compositional Structure
The performance of Vrengt may be seen as a comprovisa-
tion [8], in which the “composed” aspect of the instrument
and choreography provides a large amount of freedom in
collectively exploring sonic interactions throughout the per-
formance. The piece was structured in three parts:
1. Breath: The ﬁrst part explores the embodied sounds
of the dancer. Her face is covered (Figure 1), which
physically forces her to leverage the kinesthetic and
auditory senses. She explores the creation of acoustic
feedback loops based on the proximity to the speak-
ers, and these loops are modulated and dynamically
controlled by the musician.
2. Standstill: This section exploits using micromotion in
sonic microinteraction. The dancer describes stand-
ing still as “registering ‘what is happening’ inside my
body without the need of moving, which also intro-
duces the gravity, meditation and body-awareness.”
Even though her micromotion is barely visible, the
audience gradually starts to hear the direct audiﬁca-
tion of the dancer’s varying neural commands leading
to muscle contraction.
3. Musicking: Both performers join the active process of
music-making. With the dancer’s own words, this is
where she is “accessing the musician’s skills and vice
versa.” During the ﬁrst two sections, the audience
becomes accustomed with the improvised movement
patterns; the relationship between these movements
and the variations in breath patterns; how her tiniest
bodily exertions “sound” during standstill; and ﬁnally,
how these sounds evolve throughout as she gradually
switches from StandStill to Musicking.
4. IMPLEMENTATION
The hardware system of Vrengt includes (Figure 2):
•two Myo armbands, one placed on left forearm and
one on the right calf muscle of the dancer
•a wireless headset microphone
•a MIDI controller
•two laptop computers running Max/MSP patches
187
Figure 2: Signal ﬂow diagram for the performance of Vrengt.
The armbands are connected to the computer via individ-
ual Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) adapters for overcoming
possible bandwidth limitations. The EMG data is acquired
with Myo Armband’s ﬁxed sample rate at 200Hz and sent
via myo-to-osc [26] into Max, where the raw EMG signals
are pre-processed for full-wave rectiﬁcation, smoothing and
feature extraction (Figure 2).
A lightweight and unobtrusive head-worn condenser lava-
lier microphone (Sennheiser SL Headmic) is used for cap-
turing the breathing in the form of audio signals that are
sent through a wireless transmitter to the laptops.
4.1 Mapping
Inspired by the spatiotemporal matrix [17], we started the
mapping exploration by recording raw EMG time series of
the dancer’s muscle activity at diﬀerent levels: micro (dur-
ing standstill), meso (ﬁnger extensions, arm ﬂexion) and
macro (larger actions). Then we tried various feature ex-
tractors from [33], among which we decided to use themean
absolute value (MAV) upon a preliminary evaluation by
mapping the processed data into the sound objects. Af-
ter having deﬁned the basic structure of the mappings, we
subjectively evaluated each distinct action through a pro-
cess of “cross-modal interpretation.” The dancer performed
the given patterns mapped into diﬀerent sound objects, and
described her experiences ﬁguratively, in order to determine
the meaningful action–sound causalities (Table 1).
Our exploration of perception–action relationships may
be seen as unnecessarily time-consuming, but we found this
to be necessary to better understand “what is happening”
between the body and the sound. This is often “arcane” in-
formation embedded in the computational processes. The
main user interface for the purpose of shared control is a
custom virtual mixer that sums the individual sound mod-
ules, allowing the musician to modify the mix levels of the
resultant sounds (volume, panning, eﬀects, and so on) along
with the data processes (e.g. routing and feature scaling).
This is inspired by the seminal work of Alvin Lucier’sMusic
for Solo Performer (1965), in which his assistants controlled
the sound modules throughout the performance [42].
4.2 Sound Objects
Physics-based synthesis simulates acoustic excitation and
resonance features [40, 12] to approximate responsive phys-
ical behaviors in digital domain [35], particularly for con-
tinuous physical interaction [27]. In our work we have used
the Sound Design Toolkit (SDT) for physically–informed
procedural sound synthesis in Max, speciﬁcally the low–
level models (e.g. friction and bubble) and complex tex-
tures (e.g. scraping and ﬂuidﬂows) [1]. These have been

Adduction Scraping “To deﬂate”
Various Waveshaping “Shapes without images”
combined with the eﬀects processing objects (e.g. scrub∼
and pit shift∼) from the PeRColate collection [45].
The SDT basic solid interactions are based on a modu-
lar “resonator–interactor–resonator” structure [1]. This al-
lows a fairly straightforward thinking in building mapping
strategies that refer to physical phenomena between objects
in contact. The sound of friction, for instance, is a phe-
nomenon that is most often present in our lives [37], such
as the sound of a squeaking door or a knife sliding on a
ceramic plate. We can then imagine several “meaningful”
ways of associating body movements with everyday sounds.
We used many-to-many mappings between the calf mus-
cle signals and the force, pressure, stiﬀness, dissipation and
velocity parameters of the interactor algorithm (sdt.friction∼),
together with the center frequency of a narrow-Q band pass
ﬁlter, to provide us with a sense of “squeaking” in the mo-
tions of the lower limb. Similarly, we used force, grain and
velocity parameters of sdt.scraping∼ to evoke the feeling of
“ﬁling” when moving the upper limb. However, the per-
ceived sense of the latter model was quite diﬀerent in the
end (see Table 1).
In liquids, sounds are heard only when the air is trapped
by water [24]. It is therefore a convenient approach to draw
on the acoustical properties of bubbles when designing in-
teractions with liquid sounds. A single, impulsive bubble
sound is deﬁned by its radius and rising factor (ibid), which
is simulated by exponentially decaying sinusoidal oscilla-
tors [1]. Then, more complex phenomena can be obtained
through statistical approaches as in thesdt.ﬂuidﬂow∼, which
is a stochastic model. Our strategy was employing the sig-
nals of the forearm muscle to modify the speed, density and
radii of a stream of bubbles, together with the amount of
scrub∼ delay [45] for spatial enhancement. This provided us
with sounds that can dynamically morph back and forth, in
a continuum between rhythm and tone, echoing the uniﬁed
time structuring of Stockhausen [41].
188
Additionally, we have explored non-linear (abstract) tech-
niques, such as waveshape distortion, ring modulation (RM)
and exponential frequency modulation (FM) for textural
purposes. One technique we found intuitive, was to expo-
nentially re-scale the sine wave carrier with multiple sine
modulators in a continuous manner through several many-
to-many mappings that are also exponentially and randomly
re-scaled. The result is a quasi-stochastic behavior resem-
bling some of the non-linearities found in using extended
techniques on acoustic instruments [43].
For the breath signals, we have implemented Schroeder
Reverberators [39] together with interconnected multiple de-
lay lines, particularly for sustaining fast attacks. These
are simultaneously controlled by the musician, allowing the
dancer to interact with the physical space via intentional
acoustic feedback loops.
5. DISCUSSION
Vrengt has been performed twice in public so far, once on
stage in a large auditorium, and another time in a club en-
vironment. In the latter it was performed together with an
additional musician and a visual artist. This showed how we
can use the instrument in further collaborative situations. 1
In the following, we brieﬂy discuss some of the thoughts we
have had during those processes, speciﬁcally the subjective
evaluations of the dancer and the musician.
5.1 Musician
For a traditionally trained musician and composer to start
working with interactive dance, requires stepping outside
the comfort zone. Years of experience with working within
a familiar instrumental paradigm has to be exchanged with
imagining oneself in the athletic and artistic circumstances
of a dancer. This was the reason we decided to embark
on a fairly long, exploratory journey of the dancer’s move-
ment patterns: from involuntary micromotions to deliber-
ate full body movements. The analyses of the sensor data
was followed by a number of trials during which diﬀerent
sound objects provided the musician with an experience-
based schemata for evaluating the ecological validity of action–
sound causalities (see Section 4) and particular sound syn-
thesis models.
The second part of the development involved rehearsals 2
and verbal communication to start shaping the sound de-
sign. This phase also involved developing a shared lan-
guage for describing the experience, using metaphors such
as “squeezing a wet sponge” for grasping ﬁnger motion, or
“planting deeply” for standing still. Such comments are nec-
essary to understand the dancer’s feelings, despite the lack
of haptic experience when performing in the air. Moreover,
such comments are powerful enough to deﬁne a path for fu-
ture work on the relevant topics of sonic interaction design.
Figure 3 describes how the musician sees and experiences
the system. The dancer is the main source of gestural input,
but the musician makes the decisions of the sound objects,
data scaling, and mix levels in realtime. This inﬂuences and
steers the dancer who, in her own words, “moves through
listening.” In fact, from the musician’s perspective, one can
draw an analogy between the dancer and the autonomous
musical agents of generative systems. In this sense, the
“genericity” of the dancer leans towards the right end of the
continuum of autonomy in [44], as she learns how to interact
with the musician.
The presence of the musician in this project is enacted

formance, showing the levels of connection between

by means of the dancer’s autonomy together with the ma-
chine’s data processing and sound generation abilities. This
echoes the notion of “shared control” in the ﬁeld of robotic
musicianship, which often implies machine intelligence that
augments human capabilities [2]. The purpose of such an
analogy is not to get into a debate about the human versus
the machine, but rather to portray the intimacy between
the dancer’s body and the machine, and how that is shared
by the musician.
5.2 Dancer
From the dancer’s perspective, performing with realtime
soniﬁcation is fundamentally diﬀerent than dancing to mu-
sic. In the former case, the soniﬁcation steers the move-
ments at both conscious and unconscious levels, and pro-
vides a sense of coherence. However, in the latter case,
you may experience a “less or unpredictable sense of co-
herence.” Throughout the collaboration, the potential of
gesture–sound relationships became more clear, which al-
lowed the dancer to develop “a gestural repertoire and a
physical landscape”with a sophisticated control of her move-
ment, and hence sound. This enabled listening as the main
source for decision making, while intuitively moving along
with “a physical play and exploration.” An interesting way
of how she portrays her experience with the gained ability of
sound-producing is as “a duet” of movement and the sound.
As she puts it:
“The precision between the muscle activation and
listening drives the duet forward. It is like the
ability to enter a state of not knowing where to,
and how to, still with a clear sense of direction.
To uncover speciﬁcity in the ﬁeld of movement
and sound; making sense collectively to hear the
dance and to embody the sound.”
One satisfactory aspect of such an instrument from the
dancer’s perspective, is the shift of focus from the body to
the sound. This is described by the dancer as “the sen-
sation of moving through listening,” which echoes Paine’s
techno-somatic dimension [32]. In addition to the “feeling”
of playing on the instrument, she indicates how her expe-
rience with the “soniﬁed muscle tension” resembles her use
of tactility when an oral explanation is insuﬃcient. She
describes her experience of working with muscle signals as:
“Learning to relate to a new type of body and a
new physical language that can provide an audi-
ble response.”
189
Figure 4: The dancer, the musician and the second
musician in a rehearsal.
Her impressions about co-performing on the same instru-
ment is described as “playing together while accessing each
other’s skills.” She uses the Norwegian word“vrengt,” which
she exempliﬁes as the act of turning a sweater outwards,
pointing to how the artistic intentions and skills are merged
together. Furthermore, she emphasizes how each diﬀerent
sound object has a distinct image in her mind (see Table
1) and she “examined the duration, pace and consistency
of every movement within them.” Reﬂecting on the use of
abstract algorithms for sound synthesis, she comments that
they resemble shapes that she can “ﬁll with any image you
want.” This can be seen as opposed to more straightforward
sonic imagery of physics-based models. Moreover, she can-
not choose one or the other technique in terms of the level
of engagement and embodied control. It is an important
user-centered aspect, which should be further investigated.
5.3 A “Shared” Reﬂection
The usefulness of Vrengt’s shareability to the overall aes-
thetics can be discussed in terms of the unity of two bodies
and two machines. This relates to how Marco Donnarumma
conceptualizes human-machine embodiment as “a form of
hybrid corporeality where experience, psyche, materiality
and technics are always in tension against each other” [6]. A
natural outcome of this hybrid embodiment is an intimate,
bodily knowledge of each other at the boundary between
cognitive vs unconscious. This is diﬀerent than sharing the
same stage while not in a joint technological conﬁguration.
We observe the ﬁrst aesthetic consequence of this unity in
the Breath part of the piece. What makes the role of the mu-
sician diﬀerent than a tonmeister in controlling the acous-
tic feedback loops (see Section 3.2) is the multidimensional
knowledge of the dancer’s breath patterns. At the other
end, the musician’s interactions become part of how the
dancer’s bodily exertions happen to be in a sound-producing
context. Thus, the overall aesthetics can be viewed as an n-
dimensional space of bodily and technical co-dependencies.
Similar forms of co-dependence are observed in theStand-
still and Musicking sections. These forms are based on
the ongoing complex bodily interactions at various spatial,
physiological and cognitive levels. We can then argue that
the particular aesthetic results of Vrengt would not have
been achieved with other methods, such as working in sep-
arate and/or ﬁxed layers.
Perhaps the most signiﬁcant issue in conceptualizingVrengt
as a multi-user instrument, is the performers’ uneven bod-
ily contributions. In a more balanced scenario, the musician
would use a sensor-based controller, thereby creating more
of a hybrid corporeality. In our current setup, the share-
ability of Vrengt is at the musician’s “ﬁngertips” only, when
compared to the dancer’s full-body experience.
6. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have presented the development of a multi-
user instrument used in a music–dance performance context.
This project has been centered on a common apparatus, in
which shareability, soniﬁcation, micromotion, and muscle
activity have been core elements. We have aimed to de-
sign a shareable instrument that blends distinct embodied
skills. The ﬁnal result is a joint musical expression of two
performers. This has been achieved by building an entirely
situated design methodology, starting from investigating the
dancer’s breathing and other involuntary micromotion while
standing still. This was followed by using soniﬁcation as
an artistic-scientiﬁc tool to explore and enhance the data
in question. Furthermore, using various physics-based and
abstract sound synthesis techniques allowed for subjectively
evaluating their cross-modal associations and levels of em-
bodiment.
In future research, we will continue to build on the model
of shared agency developed for Vrengt. We are particularly
interested in exploring the body as a musical interface. This
will be done with a particular focus on the co-creativity of
humans and machines, and using intuitive control strategies
for physical modeling synthesis and embodied sonic cogni-
tion.
