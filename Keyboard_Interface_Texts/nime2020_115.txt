ABSTRACT
This paper presents an overview of the design principles be-
hind Digital Music Instruments (DMIs) for education across
all editions of the International Conference on New Inter-
faces for Music Expression (NIME). We compiled a com-
prehensive catalogue of over hundred DMIs with varying
degrees of applicability in the educational practice. Each
catalogue entry is annotated according to a proposed tax-
onomy for DMIs for education, rooted in the mechanics of
control, mapping and feedback of an interactive music sys-
tem, along with the required expertise of target user groups
and the instrument learning curve. Global statistics unpack
underlying trends and design goals across the chronological
period of the NIME conference. In recent years, we note
a growing number of DMIs targeting non-experts and with
reduced requirements in terms of expertise. Stemming from
the identiﬁed trends, we discuss future challenges in the de-
sign of DMIs for education towards enhanced degrees of
variation and unpredictability.

1. INTRODUCTION
In Western societies, music is typically taught as a set of
principles emerging from the common-practice tonal mu-
sic period as systematized in the vast plethora of musical
treatises [7, 13]. Typically, the journey commences with
the study of multiple hierarchies such as scales, followed by
the identiﬁcation and building of intervals and prototypi-
cal chords. Once these constructs are mastered, the study

of functional harmony is undertaken, which ultimately dic-
tates pitch relations and harmonic motion. In this con-
text, music education gives a signiﬁcant primacy to discrete
Western notation-based concepts of note and duration. Re-
maining dimensions, such as timbre and performance-driven
attributes such as micro-timing are seen as secondary at-
tributes [23].
Furthermore, music education is typically split into areas
of specialization, such as genre (e.g., classical, pop and jaz z)
and sub-specialization areas such as music composition or
performance. Together with the preceding observation on
the predominance of the common-practice period, most mu-
sicians wind up learning instruments stemming from the
orchestral period, and the musicianship is typically focused
on a master-apprenticeship paradigm [16]. In this context,
one of the main objectives of the instrumentalists practice
routine is virtuosity [22], whose foundations ultimately pro-
mote high levels of technical and performative (i.e., staging)
aptitude [5].
In light of the interdependence of music creation and tech-
nology, in which musical instruments not only constitute
major pieces of technological mastery but are also seminal
for the development of musical expression [18], we aim to en-
lighten the disruptive value of Digital Musical Instruments
(DMIs) in promoting new pedagogic approaches [17]. DMIs
expand the traditional Western orchestral instruments and
challenge the musical practice towards new corporeality,
materiality, control and feedback [12]. In this context, we
provide a comprehensive catalogue of DMIs for education
in all editions of the New Interfaces for Musical Expres-
sion (NIME) conference, a privileged venue for the DMIs
community. The catalogue is available online at:https:
//sites.google.com/view/dmicatalogue. Each DMI en-
try in the catalogue is classiﬁed according to a proposed
taxonomy. Global statistics from our catalogue aim to ul-
timately unpack the trends and goals of DMIs design and
shed light on the paradigms of the educational practice they
promote.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 describes the methodological approach adopted to
select the DMIs included in the proposed catalogue and de-
tails the dimensions of a taxonomy for classifying DMIs for
education. Section 3 provides an overview of trends across
the DMI catalogue to support the identiﬁcation of the de-
sign goals of DMIs for music education. Finally, Section 4
discusses future directions and new trends of DMI for music
education.

2. A CA T ALOGUE OF DMI FOR EDUCA-
TION IN THE NIME CONFERENCE
Figure 1 shows the architecture of a typical DMI, which
we understand as a system that features a control surface
(also referred to as gesture or performance controller, input
device or hardware interface) and a sound generation unit.
As a result of our broad understanding of a DMI, multiple
sonic materializations and application scenarios from instal-
lations to games or even sound toys are considered in the
compiled catalogue of DMIs for education.

Rectangular blocks denote the main component
modules. Data ﬂux is indicated by directional ar-
rows.
Across the entire archive of the NIME proceedings rang-
ing from the years 2001 to 2019, we identiﬁed and listed the
DMIs motivated for, or supporting music education activ-
ities. To identify and select the DMIs for education to in-
clude in the catalogue, we adopted a twofold method. First,
we browsed and identiﬁed the papers, including relevant
keywords at the crossroads of musical practice and educa-
tion. Table 1 lists the set of keywords adopted in the search
process, which we split into two categories: areas of knowl-
edge (e.g., study and training) and agents (e.g., student and
novices). Second, from the resulting pool of papers, we did
a thorough review of their contribution.
During the second phase of the review process, we ex-
tracted from each paper relevant information of the DMI.
To this end, we propose a taxonomy of DMI for educa-
tion adapted from Magnusson [10]. Broadly, it covers di-
mensions related to the system identiﬁcation (year, author,
DMI name and degree of educational aﬃliation ); attributes
from the interactive component modules [4, 19, 22] ( inter-
actors, input controller, control parameters , and typology)
and information of the target users and musicianship ( re-
quired expertise and learning curve ). Figure 2 shows the
taxonomy dimensions in detail.
2.1 DMI Identiﬁcation
The DMI identiﬁcation dimensions index a particular DMI
in the catalogue by a unique interface name entry, au-
thor(s) names(s), and the year it features in the proceedings
archives (which may not coincide with the year of the DMI
creation). To this set of entries, the degree of educational af-
ﬁliation was identiﬁed using a threefold categorization. The
ﬁrst and strongest tie, establishes an explicit link between

the DMI and education, as the result of being the primarily
identiﬁed goal of the DMI in the paper. The second tie does
not mention education as a primary area of the activity but
states the potential of the DMI in this context. The third
and weakest tie does not link the DMI to education, but a
more attentive reading of the paper highlights some clear
evidence of its potential in the area.
For example, in the ﬁrst category, we can ﬁnd Wireless
Sensor Interface and Gesture-Follower for Music Pedagogy
[1], a DMI gestural interface built to support music theory
lessons in the classroom;An Augmented Flute for Begin-
ners[6], a digital interface that shows multiple attributes of
a ﬂautist embouchure tracked from sensor-augmented ﬂute;
andHaptic-Listening and the Classical Guitar [11], a haptic-
listening DMI that presents the listener with a represen-
tation of the vibrotactile feedback perceived by a classical
guitarist during performance through the use of haptic stim-
ulation.
In the second category, we can ﬁnd DrumTop [21], a
DMI that enables users to explore the creative potential
of rhythmic interactions with everyday objects;Piano Ped-
aller [9], an interface for measuring, classifying, and Visu-
alizing piano pedalling techniques; and, Separating sound
from source [14], a hybrid violin with digitally automated
pitch and tone correction through electrodynamic pickups,
acoustic actuation and sonic transformations.
In the third category, we can ﬁnd Musician Maker [3],
a system that allows novice users to create expressive im-
provisational music;Tok! [8], a collaborative percussive
instrument using mobile phones; and Sound Control [15],
a software toolkit designed for children with disabilities to
create custom digital musical interfaces.
2.2 Inter-actors, control and typology
The design of a DMI can be understood within the concep-
tual framework of an interactive music system, from which
we borrow its component modules as dimensions of our tax-
onomy. In greater detail, for each DMI entry in the cata-
logue, we deﬁne the DMI inter-actors across the multiple
combinations of human and computational agents; the in-
teraction input control and parameters; and, ﬁnally, the
typology of the system, ranging from sequenced to genera-
tive responses. Adopted dimensions are roughly based on
[10], [19], [2] and [4].
Inter-actors deﬁne the agents involved in a performative
ecology using a DMI. It can adopt three categories: one
human performer and one computational system; multiple
human performers and one computational system; and, ﬁ-
nally, multiple human performers and multiple computa-
tional systems.
Interaction input control can assume three categories:

a physical controller, transparent embodied gestures, and
audio. Physical controllers include, for example, gloves,
joysticks, keyboards, gamepads or mobile phones. Trans-
parent embodied gestures refer to interaction modalities
which do not require a physical interface between the user
and the computer to accomplish a particular action. Au-
dio as an input controller denotes the use of audio at-
tributes (e.g., pitch, amplitude and brightness) from sound-
producing sources.
The control parameters dimension in our taxonomy is
split into seven categories: pitch, duration, dynamics, tone
colour (or timbre), articulation, vibrato, other audio eﬀects.
The list of control parameters includes both primary and
secondary properties of music notation [23] as well as ex-
pressive performance qualities.
DMI typology can be deﬁned as either score-driven,
performance-driven, or hybrid. Score-driven DMIs incor-
porate predeﬁned compositional structures in the style of
a score following system [3]. Performance-driven DMIs has
no pre-built knowledge or a priori compositional structure
and relates to musical improvisation settings [8]. Hybrid
DMI include the two previous strategies [20].
2.3 T arget users: required expertise and
learning curve
To characterize the DMI design considerations related to
the target users, we adopt two dimensions in our taxon-
omy: required user expertise and the DMI learning curve.
The required expertise is subdivided into two categories:
non-experts, i.e., novice users with little to no knowledge
of music theory and practice, and experts, i.e., users with
advanced training in music theory and practice. This split
characterizes the required initial experience to appropriate
and/or manipulate a DMI interface expressively. Finally,
degrees of training, proﬁciency or virtuosity detail the learn-
ing curve of the DMI to achieve expressive proﬁciency. We
divide this dimension into two categories: elementary, which
requires no musical or performative training, and advanced,
which is intended for highly skilled virtuosos; thus, requir-
ing much training.
3. ELICITING TRENDS AND GOALS
ACROSS DMI DESIGN FOR EDUCA-
TION
From the collected data in the catalogue, we computed
global statistics, which we present and discuss in this sec-
tion. Our main aim is to expose temporal trends across
the data per dimension. Figure 3 provides an overall per-
spective on the number of DMIs for education across the
temporal span of the NIME editions (on the horizontal X-
axis). The blue vertical bars report the percentage of pa-
pers focusing on DMIs for education as a result of summing
the three degrees of educational aﬃliation in our taxonomy.
The red line indicates the percentage of DMIs with strong
ties to education (i.e., the ﬁrst category in our taxonomy).
The regression lines from the data (in light blue and light
red) expose an increase of attention on this topic over the
years, namely from DMI with explicit ties with educational
activities.
Figure 3: Number of DMIs for education across all
editions of the NIME conference. Blue bars indicate
all DMIs with links to the topic and red line those
with a strong tie. Regression lines are shown for
each category.
Figures 4 - 7 show stacked bar graphs, which compare
the categories of each of the taxonomy dimensions across
the DMIs for education in NIME. Two diﬀerent graphs per
dimension are adopted. On the left, we show a stacked
graph with total counts per category across all NIME edi-
tions. On the right, we show the percentage of distribution
per year.
Figure 4 shows the inter-actors dimension. A prominent
DMI category is one human performer and one computa-
tional system, followed by multiple human performers and

one computational system. These two categories empha-
size DMIs design as a continuation the expressive modalities
found in Western music practice and the role of the acous-
tic instruments, mostly designed for individual performance
and orchestral ensembles.
Figure 5 shows the DMI typology dimension. Despite the
predominance of score-driven DMIs, performance-driven
DMIs have gained increased attention since 2010. This shift
may be linked and explain the growing number of DMIs for
improvisational practice.

Figures 6 and 7 show the target users dimensions of the
DMIs for education, notably the degree of required exper-
tise and the learning curve, respectively. We can observe a
signiﬁcant focus on DMIs for non-experts and an elemen-
tary degree of required expertise. This dimension of the
taxonomy is the most expressive in distinguishing DMIs
from Western orchestral instruments, as it denotes an in-
creased focus on DMIs for novice users which promote im-
mediate and expressive musical experiences. This trend can
be understood in the context of the growing number of algo-
rithmic methods for music creation that promote engaging
experiences for users with very little musical training.
4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE CHAL-
LENGES
In this paper, we compiled a comprehensive catalogue of
DMI for education across all editions of the NIME con-
ference. Furthermore, we proposed a taxonomy for DMI

mension across the NIME conference editions. On

based on dimensions from interactive music systems and
target users and practices. Each DMI entry was character-
ized accordingly. From the catalogue, we computed global
statistics which aim to unpack the trends and design goals
of DMI, which we discuss in light of the traditional orches-
tral practice of Western instrumental music. The catalogue
is available online as a CSV ﬁle to promote easy access to
the collected data.
From the preliminary statistical analysis of the catalogue,
we observe an increasing interest of DMI for education in re-
cent years. A notable target on novice users without music
theory and practice training suggests an eﬀort in providing
expressive musical experiences for this group of users. More-
over, it may be symptomatic of the changes across the range
of pedagogical tools available and the market of musical toys
and digital application for mobile handheld devices, such as
smartphones. On the other hand, the elementary degree of
required training observed across most DMIs place them in
between musical toys and ﬂeeting experiences, which may
not prompt continuous investment on the part of the users.
Despite the large degree of aﬃliation observed in our anal-
ysis between current DMIs design and traditional Western
instruments, DMIs have the potential to explore musical ex-
pression and practices beyond this scope. In combination
with existing pedagogical strategies, existing DMIs enable
the introduction of new topics of interest in musical cur-
ricula. First, they show high potential for motivating the
study and practice of music due to its almost immediate
results, which traditional orchestral instruments cannot at-
tain. Second, their materialization is typically directed to
the use of low-cost devices, such as smartphones, which we
carry on a daily basis, enforcing high degrees of portabil-
ity and adaptability to the needs and pace of individuals.

Third, they show great potential for the exploration of con-
crete sounds in designing soundscapes, rethinking local and
global cultural heritage and even the promotion of diversity
across cultural traditions from multi-instrument practices
emulated via the digital domain. In this context, in light of
the extensive list of DMIs, we believe that a stronger focus
should be directed towards the study of pedagogical plans
for their appropriation within music curricula.
DMIs can also be used to revisit the communication medi-
ums in music performance and education beyond the phys-
ical, performative space settings. The identiﬁed growing
DMI trend adopting multiple performers and a single inter-
active system can enable remote network performances. As
such, music curricula can adhere to holistic approaches to
an apprenticeship from musical manifestations.
