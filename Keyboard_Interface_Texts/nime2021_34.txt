ABSTRACT
This paper provides a study of a workshop which invited composers, musicians, and 
sound designers to explore instruments from the history of electronic sound in 
Sweden. The workshop participants applied media archaeology methods towards 
analyzing one particular instrument from the past, the Dataton System 3000. They 
then applied design fiction methods towards imagining several speculative instruments 
of the future. Each stage of the workshop revealed very specific utopian ideas 
surrounding the design of sound instruments. After introducing the background and 
methods of the workshop, the authors present an overview and thematic analysis of 
the workshop's outcomes. The paper concludes with some reflections on the use of this 
method-in-progress for investigating the ethics and affordances of historical electronic 
sound instruments. It also suggests the significance of ethics and affordances for the 
design of contemporary instruments.

Introduction
The subject of this study, the "Sounds of Futures Passed" workshop, took place within 
the context of ongoing research into historically-informed sound synthesis. The overall 
project is based on a collection of electronic instruments [1] used by composers in 
Sweden during the 1960's and 70's collected by the Swedish Performing Arts Agency 
(Musikverket) and archived by the Performing Arts Museum (Scenkonstmuseet). As 
the first experiment of our project, this workshop was an opportunity to explore 
different methodologies alongside one particular artifact, the Dataton System 3000. In 
combining a workshop approach with the prompt of a historical sound device, we ask 
how such devices can be used to inspire new contemporary instruments. We further 
wish to investigate what can be learned through a dialog between the historic and the 
contemporary. Our interest lies in the social dimensions of instrument creation and 
use, rather than simply the material ones. This paper describes a method, inspired by 
the theoretical discourses and playful "what-if" scenarios of media archaeology and

design fiction, which we implemented in our research to examine these social 
dimensions. 
Workshops have consistently been valuable tools for studying the prototyping of New 
Interfaces for Musical Expression. Example workshops within the NIME community 
have ranged from exploring the cognitive and material relationships between gesture 
and sound [2], or the use of hardware and software toolkits to involve children in 
instrument creation [3], to rapidly prototype deliberately rough and unfinished sound 
interactions from everyday objects [4] [5]. As seen in the example of Anderson's 
"Magic Machines" [6], there is an emerging focus on the use of imaginary instruments 
and non-functioning models within the workshop practice. Such design fictions can 
inform the design process by freeing us from the engineering constraints of reality [7], 
or by overcoming "solutionist thinking" which seeks to apply the latest available 
technology to non-existent problems [8]. Design fiction workshops can also elucidate 
the cultural and aesthetic values held by members of particular musical communities 
[9] [10].
While countless NIME projects seek to repurpose or reinterpret classical acoustic 
instruments, fewer seek an active dialog with the history of electronic sound. However, 
recent doctoral scholarship on the topic finds compelling media archaeological 
research being done with the analysis and reimagining of unique historical 
instruments [11] and the performance of canonical musical works employing "reverse-
engineered" interpretations of the original electronics [12]. These projects straddle the 
border between the worlds of conservation and musicology on the one side, and new 
artistic creation on the other. Previous NIME contributions have detailed the 
redesigning of vintage technology as interactive art [13], drawn inspiration from 
neglected historical computer compositions [14], or re-examined historical 
experimental music concepts such as the "readymade" [15] as the starting points for 
contemporary works. Notably, each example focuses on a reenactment of the 
affordances provided by a historical object, rather than on a perfect reconstruction of 
its original technical implementation. 
Although an organology of the instruments under study would be necessary for a 
structured approach to our historical research, we felt that a taxonomy based on their 
functions of sound causation alone would not provide us with the right tools. Recent 
work on the organology of NIMEs [16][17], as well as on the social contexts of 
historical electronic sound instruments [18] both draw upon concepts from the 
discipline of science and technology studies to expand their analysis. As Latour's actor-

network theory suggests [19], technological instruments are neither passive, neutral, 
nor transparent objects. Rather, such objects possess agencies of their own which are 
strongly shaped by the contexts and ideologies from which they arose, and which go on 
to shape their subsequent use. And if instruments can be considered active 
participants in their deployment in society, then it makes sense to discuss their ethics. 
Tresch and Dolan [20] propose a new system of analysis which takes ethics as its basis 
and applies this concept to the agency of nonhuman objects. They suggest that the 
ethics of an instrument can be discussed according to several categories; the parts 
necessary to make and differentiate it; the degree to which it's actions are 
"autonomous or passive, modifying or transparent, hidden or visible"; the rules and 
obligations to which the instrument relates; and the ends to which the instrument is 
directed. In the case of sound synthesis technology from a half century ago, these 
ethical ends were often utopian in their vision of a new musical future. 
Because an instrument's affordances are aligned with the user’s experience, and 
depend on the context in which the instrument is used, they provide a means through 
which we might consider an instrument's ethics [21]. Looking backwards into time by 
way of media archaeology, we can trace out the ethics encoded within and affordances 
provided by technological objects. Leaping forwards in time via design fiction, we may 
enter into an imaginary realm of limitless possibilities, unbounded by material 
restrictions. And through the combination of both, we might arrive at design concepts 
which bring forward the sounds-of-futures-passed with renewed inspiration.
Background
Media Archaeology and Design Fiction
Technological innovations anticipate a better future, but we can only ever imagine the 
future through the lens of the present. This remains as true for people living decades 
or centuries ago as for us now, and only through the lens of the present can we look 
back at them and their creations. Media archaeology is one critical method of doing so. 
It explores neglected historical themes; alternative historical narratives; obsolete, 
dead, or "zombie" media; imaginary or non-existent media; unusual applications of 
archival material; and hidden or buried conditions within media devices themselves 
[22][23]. In practice, such archaeology often excavates a media artifact from the past 
and connects it with the present in ways which help us understand our contemporary 
relationship with technology.

A significant part of media archaeology ends up looking at what we might call the 
design fictions of past eras, which were imagining their own futures. Consider the 
artist's rendition of H. Grindell Matthews' "Light-Beam Piano" which appeared on the 
cover of Science and Invention magazine in 1926 [24](Figure 1). Bearing little 
resemblance to the actual invention described in the article, this fabulous vision of the 
future is made up almost entirely of individual parts easily recognisable to an audience 
of the 1920's. We see the massive body of a grand piano, played by a fashionable young 
lady, a set of horn speakers clearly evoking the phonograph, a rack of glowing vacuum 
tubes representing the most current electronics technology, and even a painstakingly 
depicted mains cable running from piano to wall socket, just in case there was any 
doubt in the viewer's mind that the whole arrangement is electrified. To this has been 
added the fantastic: what appears to our modern eyes as a series of laser beams 
shooting through spinning, fiery discs which (somehow!) produce the sounds coming 
from the speakers. (See page 896 to find out how!)

Everything this speculative design presents as desirable represents the antithesis of 
what one expects from consumer technology now. The Light-Beam Piano is heavily 
immobile, blaringly indiscreet, fully manual, scorching hot, and permanently tethered 
to a wire. Accordingly, making these comparisons already brings our current techno-
aspirations into sharper focus. How will today's Wired and Popular Science magazine 
covers appear a century from now? Will our current media devices have laid to rest the 
desires and fears they were engineered to satisfy or overcome? Or, if (inevitably) many 
of those desires and fears remain, what will have replaced our iPhones, Oculus Quests, 
and Spotify playlists in order to address them? 
Like media archaeology, design fiction [25] uses the familiar to help us imagine the 
unfamiliar. It often invents technologies which are almost familiar but not quite 
realized yet, such as the oft-cited human-computer interface depicted in the film 
Minority Report. It may also depict devices which are so far into the future that we can 
only envision them through familiar equivalents, such as the tricorders, 
communicators, and phasers of the original Star Trek series, which were drawn 
containing the bulky 1960's electronics components more often seen inside consumer 
television and hi-fi systems of the day [26]. It communicates these imaginary 
technologies through well-established media genres such as product advertisements, 
retail catalogs, user manuals, travel guides, and technical diagrams. Critically, the 
most socially ambitious design fictions use an imagined future to make sense of the 
present. Projects such as Anderson's "Magic Machines" workshops suggest that 
innovation for its own sake is absurd and meaningless if we haven't figured out how to 
solve the problems we currently face with the abundant technologies we already have 
[27].
The Dataton System 3000
For our ongoing research into historically-informed sound synthesis, we began with 
the Dataton System 3000. This modular synthesizer and audio mixer was designed by 
Björn Sandlund in Sweden during the 1970’s as a pedagogical tool. An official 
government report published in 1977 recommended that every music school in the 
country be provided with one [28]. Unfortunately, this advice was not followed, and 
Sandlund's Dataton company instead moved into multimedia presentation technology 
[29]. As such, the System 3000 represents a particular utopian vision of a future — one 
in which almost anyone could access the means to make electronic music — which was 
never reached. Historically, the specific modules available to us have been used for

electronic composition courses by KHM Royal Academy of Music, in the private studio 
of Swedish composer Leo Nilsson, and at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki.
At our disposal was a working system with over one dozen modules, with which the 
workshop participants could familiarize themselves. This particular System 3000 
contains the following module types:
Several of these modules were duplicated in our collection. The Dataton's unique 
design feature is a clever system of horizontal and vertical busses routed through 
rugged, interlocking connectors on the four side panels of each module. This allows 
modules to be laid out like tiles and directly plugged together, with the main stereo 
bus and control voltages flowing from left to right, four discrete audio channels 
running from top to bottom, and the supply power available at any connection. Special 
patch cables can also be used to span longer distances between the connectors.

As with the early Buchla and Serge synthesizers, no keyboard controller was provided 
(although Sandlund did have eventual plans for both touch and breath controllers). 
The physical interface of the System 3000 - consisting entirely of knobs, faders, 
switches, and pushbuttons - presents many of the same possibilities and limitations in 
live performance as other modular instruments of the time. While a digital sequencing 
module (Polyphonic Computer 3301) was also available, it was considered too 
complicated for use within the timeframe of this particular workshop. The selected 
modules were documented through a series of YouTube videos for the participants' 
reference [30].

Participant Profiles
The workshop involved ten participants, who were mainly students describing 
themselves as composers, performers, audio engineers, sound designers, and music 
producers. All were in their 20's-30's. Despite efforts to involve more women in the 
workshop, only one participant was female. Two thirds of the participants mainly 
worked in software, relying on the computer keyboard, mouse, MIDI keyboard, and 
other MIDI devices as controllers, as their main sound production environment. The 
remaining third of them worked primarily with commercially manufactured, hardware-
based musical instruments. Most reported feeling reasonably knowledgeable about the 
history of electronic music and the instruments used to create it. There was a balance 
between those who created sound in real time performance situations and those who 
worked largely in non-real time composing and editing situations. About half the 
participants expressed prior knowledge of basic sound synthesis techniques (AM, FM, 
additive, subtractive, etc) and claimed some experience with patchable, modular-type 
environments.
Workshop Methods
During the first phase of the workshop, participants were provided with a series of 
video tutorials and historical manuals explaining the basic functions of the Dataton 
System 3000. They were then introduced to the themes of the workshop and to the 
practice of media archaeology. Following this, participants worked in small teams of 
two or three over a week’s time to create basic sound compositions demonstrating the 
capabilities of the Dataton system. The only guidance for these compositions was that, 
while they could use basic digital editing techniques, they should avoid extensive post-
processing so that the original source material remained recognizable as such. These 
compositions were shared and collectively discussed during the second session. During 
this discussion, participants were asked to comment on the aspects of the Dataton 
1. to investigate the user experiences of an under-researched, historic electronic sound 
instrument in a contemporary setting
2. to use what was learned through direct experience with this historic instrument as 
the starting point for speculative designs of future technology
3. to use these speculative designs to compare utopian ideas of electronic sound 
instrument design from the 1970’s with those of the present day
4. and to experiment with methods of media archaeology and design fiction for use in 
future workshops on historically-informed sound synthesis.

which assisted or hindered the process, as well as speculate on what the intended uses 
of the Dataton may have been. 
The second phase of the workshop began with an introduction to the practice of design 
fiction, along with numerous examples of speculative design projects in various media 
(television, film, print, etc). We also looked at user’s manuals and promotional 
literature from other historic and contemporary synthesizer manufacturers as 
templates of how one might describe an electronic music instrument to its potential 
users. The task for each group during the subsequent week was to design a speculative 
sound instrument of the future, based on their experiences with the Dataton, and 
responding to the strengths and weaknesses of the system as previously discussed. 
Again, few limitations were applied to the process, and technical feasibility in 
particular was excluded from consideration. 
During the third and final workshop phase, the participants presented their designs in 
the form of drawn or collaged images and short written descriptions, supported by a 
verbal walkthrough of the instrument's attributes. The entire group then discussed the 
features and themes of the designs, with particular attention paid to who the intended 
user of the instrument might be, and to what ends they might use it.
Data Gathering and Analysis
Besides presenting a sound composition and speculative instrument design, 
participants were asked to fill out three surveys. The first covered their backgrounds 
and experiences, the second asked them to reflect on the process of using the Dataton 
System 3000, and the third asked them to describe specific aspects of their design 
proposals. The general workshop meetings were recorded and transcribed. Following 
the workshop sessions, the authors performed thematic analyses [31] on the 
discussions around both sets of outcomes — the sound compositions and the 
speculative instruments — assisted by the recordings and survey responses. Through 
analytic coding of the surveys and transcripts, we sought to isolate larger themes 
within both the user experience of the Dataton and the features proposed in the design 
fictions, which we felt reflected utopian technological ideals.
Workshop Results
Presentation of Compositions
The media archaeological explorations of the Dataton System 3000 during the first 
workshop week resulted in five compositions, which were presented at the second

11
general meeting. Three of the compositions were created by individual participants, 
while two compositions were created by groups of three participants. The first group's 
piece was composed by editing together single takes of different patches, passing the 
material from one participant to another through networked collaboration. The second 
group's piece was more of a collective improvisation, with two participants interacting 
with different parts of the patch while the third handled mixing the results and 
conducting the actions of the other two. Many sounds used in the pieces arose from 
the ease of creating chaotic feedback patches between the voltage controlled 
oscillators of the system. Two compositions in particular employed vocal or piano 
sounds as control signals within the Dataton. Generally, each work involved the use of 
a fairly limited number of sonic "characters" based on specific patches. These 
characters were typically steady, singular rhythmic elements alongside "organic" or 
"noisy" sounds, drones, and "watery" sounds from the resonant voltage controlled 
filters. Selections from the participants’ compositions are included in the previously 
mentioned YouTube playlist, and have also been archived by KTH [32].
User Experiences with the Dataton
While aesthetic commentary on the compositions themselves was a part of the 
discussion, the focus of our meeting was on the participants' user experiences with the 
instrument. The consensus of the groups was that the Dataton was a “fun” and 
“exciting” tool with which to experiment and discover new sounds, but that the 
instrument was sometimes “clumsy” and often “unpredictable”. This term was used in 
both a negative and a positive context, however, indicating that "happy accidents" 
were in fact welcome and inspiring at times. Participants often reported that the 
controls were incredibly sensitive and could respond to the smallest adjustments with 
radical changes in the overall sound, but that they could not understand why certain 
sounds happened, particularly in more complex patches. One participant summarized 
the Dataton as both "intuitive but counterintuitive". 
Despite this apparent complexity, many also said that they found the architecture of 
the instrument limiting, and wished for more flexible routing methods. Several 
participants felt that they were being directed by the possibilities of the machine 
rather than the instrument expressing the user's musical ideas. They noted that the 
omission of keyboard or sequencer in favor of more direct interaction with the modules 
made the production of melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic progressions quite difficult. 
Many participants expressed a wish that the system's interface were more self-
explanatory, even though printed manuals had been provided alongside the

instrument. Participants speculated that the Dataton was intended as a radical 
departure from previous music making tools, and ideal for students and young people 
since it was immediate, accessible, portable, and hands-on. However, they also noted 
that it might not have been meant as an instrument for serious musical composition.
Presentation of Instrument Designs
At the end of the second week, the participants presented five speculative design 
fiction instruments. Each group responded to elements of the Dataton System 3000 
which they found either inspiring or frustrating during the previous week, and 
combined those elements with existent or imaginary technologies in ways which 
illuminated their own utopian ideas for music instruments of the future. Negative 
influences included the Dataton's complexity, "clumsy" interface, and limited routing. 
Positive influences included its unique, tiled method of module connectivity, its 
accessible and pedagogic nature, and the immediacy and spontaneity of its physical 
controls. Contemporary points of reference included Korg's littleBits synthesizer [33], 
the Monogram Creative Console [34], and the ReacTable interface [35]. Well-known 
children's toys such as Lego blocks and the Rubik's Cube also inspired their designs. 
The five projects are summarized in the following sections.

BONK
The first instrument (Figure 3a), whose name is derived from the ananym of “knob”, 
uses ubiquitous computing and augmented reality technologies combined with a single 
physical interface. This knob allows the user to play a programmable software 
synthesizer mapped onto any surface. Biometric sensors identify both the user and the 
finger they are using, allowing access to patches created by themselves and other 
users in the community as well as defined, finger-specific parameters. An artificial 
intelligence tutor guides new users through using the system, while bio-chip implants 
allow them to hear the sounds they create directly in their eardrums.
The Velvet Pancake
Users share this endlessly-reproducible "organic hybrid synth" (Figure 3b) by breaking 
off a piece from an already-existing instrument, embedding a special 10G chip in that 
piece, and then growing a new Velvet Pancake for themselves. The instrument is 
played via a central touchplate, buttons which provide access to AI-sorted field 
recordings captured via a global network of mobile phones, and direct mind control.

While the instrument strives to express the player's sonic ideas as accurately as 
possible, the design also includes a switch to disable this "quantization" and allow 
random surprises to occur.
Sound Cubes
Sound Cubes (Figure 3c) represent a physical patching system of small blocks laid out 
in space and communicating wirelessly. Each cube has a specific, programmable 
function as either a sound generator, control signal, or audio output via a transducer 
speaker. The proximity of a control cube to a sound generator intensifies its effect, the 
facing direction of a control cube determines which sound generator it might affect, 
and feedback loops could be created through clever arrangement of generator and 
control cubes. The cubes themselves utilize very cheap technology, and can be 3D 
printed from household plastic waste.
Dataton Cube
Based on a very popular toy from the 1980's, this portable and self-contained design 
(Figure 3d) takes the form of a cube made up of smaller cubic modules. Each module 
has a small touchscreen, runs a configurable DSP algorithm, and has a signal routing 
based on the orientations of its four edges. Routing is changed by twisting the rows 
and columns of the cube until the modules line up in the desired order. Its scalable 
complexity makes it equally suitable for both children and performing musicians.
Torn ("Tower")
A hexagonal tower of analog synthesizer modules (Figure 3e) — directly inspired by 
the form factor of the Dataton (Figure 3f) — encourages a collaborative approach to 
music making. Players on each side of the tower pass the ends of patch cables to other 
players, who may not know what sort of signal or audio might be sent to them. This 
unpredictability lends game-like qualities to social interaction.
Instrument Design Analysis
A graph of the various technologies and affordances proposed by these speculative 
instruments, which emerged from our thematic analysis, is depicted in Figure 4. 
Aspects of the Dataton can be found in multiple areas. The rectangular, 
interconnecting, modular form factor of the Dataton was clearly reinterpreted in 
imaginative ways, as were the direct, hands-on user interface elements of knobs, 
buttons, and sliders. Overwhelmingly, the participants envisioned instruments which 
were portable, immediately ready to produce sound, scalable and extensible in their

15
level of complexity to accommodate both beginners and more advanced users, and 
which provided physical control over programmable DSP. Every one of the designs the 
participants presented involved an element of collaboration or community. This aspect 
reflected the participants’ own experiences of either physically interacting with the 
instrument at the same time, or sharing data and sound materials through some form 
of networking. The pedagogic aims of the Dataton were echoed by a few of the 
designs, however the availability of electronic sound instruments to anyone became a 
priority for all the speculations.
Other formal influences also manifested themselves in the designs. For instance, 
contemporary user experience design strategies were evident in the rejection of 
external written documentation in favor of "intuitive" and self-explanatory interfaces. 
Quite curiously, while a few projects mentioned the emulation of analog waveforms or 
the use of field recordings, none of the participants would venture to describe how 
their instrument actually sounded. Instead, they universally emphasized that the

16
instruments could sound like almost anything, and that the users should have 
unlimited freedom in deciding how exactly. While not inherently contradictory, some of 
these design goals present formidable challenges to realization. For example, how can 
an instrument allow anyone to make music the instant they pick it up, yet also provide 
limitless possibilities and an absence of constraints? This issue is easily avoidable 
when creating non-functional prototypes on paper, but any subsequent design phases 
would be forced to address it.
Discussion
While an instrument based on telepathic mind control may remain an entertaining 
suggestion within the foreseeable future, the utopia expressed by that particular 
affordance is a recurring theme in the history of electronic music instruments. For 
example, Daphne Oram designed her Oramics system out of a keen desire to express 
the sounds she heard in her head as clearly as possible, without translation through 
either a symbolic musical notation or other performers [36]. In the 1970’s, Laurie 
Spiegel sought another kind of utopia:
Technology is a tremendous liberator. It blows up power structures. Women were 
naturally drawn to electronic music. You didn't have to be accepted by any of the 
male-dominated resources. You could make something with electronics, and you 
can present music directly to your audience. And that gives you tremendous 
freedom. [37]
The idea that anyone could grow their own synthesizer, play one on the wall, or spread 
one out like a pile of Lego bricks across the floor, all spring from the same vision of 
unmediated accessibility which Spiegel feels could be realized in electronic music.
Utopias are not defined merely by their technologies. They are also defined by their 
ethics, in the sense of a given technology's aims as described by Tresch and Dolan. 
Flying cars and teleportation beams exist in imaginary utopias not only for their own 
sake, but as what Bleecker calls "diegetic prototypes" to tell stories about how they 
might affect the quality of life. The ethical positions discussed in this workshop 
harmonize well with those espoused by the NIME community [38]. Participants were 
largely concerned with instruments which made sound creation affordable or 
otherwise materially accessible to many different types of users (although differences 
of ability were not explicitly addressed); were ecologically sustainable; promoted 
community involvement and shared resources; addressed the social isolation of what 
one participant labelled the "lonely synthesists"; and protected data privacy even when

17
trending-yet-problematic technologies such as biometrics, machine listening, artificial 
intelligence, augmented reality, and data clouds were involved.
Some of these very contemporary concerns cannot be directly linked to the Dataton of 
the 1970's. However many of its affordances and aims are strongly reflected by the 
workshop designs. The Dataton is immediate and responsive, scalable and flexible, 
highly portable, and at one time was intended to be accessible by any Swedish music 
student. But it is also limited by its own architecture, unpredictable, overly-complex, 
and perhaps even “un-musical” according to some users. Each of these aspects became 
a positive or negative influence on the workshop designs. Yet clearly, many of the 
Dataton's aspirations regarding the future of sound then remain a part of the 
participants' utopian ideals now.
Conclusions
In this paper, we have described the beginnings of a methodology for the design of 
new sound instruments. This methodology involves an examination of the ethics and 
affordances of electronic devices from the musical past, coupled with speculation 
about how these ethics and affordances might be realized in a technologically distant 
future. The methodology is applied to examples from the legacy of electronic music in 
Sweden. This method’s long term goal is to synthesize the observations gained through 
its use into new, historically-informed electronic sound instruments. We hypothesize 
that reenactments of the ethics and affordances of historical instruments, rather than 
period-correct reconstructions of their technical implementations, will be far more 
relevant to composers of the present day. 
To test and expand this methodology, we plan future workshops involving different 
instruments and participant groups. We recognize that, while our initial survey was 
stimulating, it was also limited in its scope and only reflected the imaginations of a 
very specific participant profile. We anticipate that targeted outreach during the 
selection of future workshop participants, particularly in terms of gender and age, will 
result in far more widely representative data. 
After the Dataton, two instruments created in 1968 stand out as promising candidates 
for further examination: the Andromatic [39] polyphonic synthesizer built by Erkki 
Kurenniemi for the composer Ralph Lundsten, and the handheld Ljuddar [40] sound 
generators used by Lundsten and Nilsson in workshops and concerts throughout
