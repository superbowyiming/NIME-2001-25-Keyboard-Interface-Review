ABSTRACT
The Electrobass is an instrument that takes inspiration from
the interface of the bass guitar, but is in fact a flexible
synthesizer. The Electrobass has roots in instruments like
the SynthAxe, the Casio DG series, and other commercial
guitar synthesis instruments, but applies this mindset to the
bass guitar with a new approach. The technology is closely
related to the authors’ Electrosteel[6] instrument, and the
Electrobass was developed simultaneously as an alternative
form for the underlying idea. This paper outlines how the
goals of the Electrobass differ from the Electrosteel, and
what changes from that paradigm the bass guitar’s interface
demands.

1. INTRODUCTION
The project was inspired by a musical problem that arose
in the first author’s live band, Owen Lake and the Tragic
Loves. The electro-country band has a synth-pop inspired
sound, with the bass lines on the recordings realized using
synthesis. However, when playing live, it was more visu-
ally interesting to have a bass player than a keyboardist,
and many of the bass lines were programmed with musical
gestures that were more idiomatic for the bass guitar. Sur-
veying the lack of acceptable commercial solutions to the
problem led to the development of the Electrobass. Beyond
filling this type of role, the goal of the instrument was to
provide another way to access synthesis control, one that
took advantage of the specific techniques of bass players,
with the hope that the instrument would eventually be ap-
propriated for other uses the authors didn’t imagine[10].

Many experimental instruments have explored this con-
cept in the past. Examples that model stringed instruments
with ribbon interfaces date back at least to the “Finger-
board Theremin” created by Leon Theremin in the early
1930s[1]. More recent projects that have a similar spirit
are the BoSSA[8] and the XTSynth[5]. Several NIMEs di-
rectly approach the interface of the electric guitar, if not
the electric bass, including the GXtar[4] and the commercial
products of the Starr Labs MIDI Guitars1, which includes a
MIDI bass. Taking a wider view of the subject, Harrison[2]
dives into an enlightening experiment with several guitar-
like interfaces to determine how much input modality vs
global form create musician’s perceptions of an instrument.
2. IDENTIFYING IMPORTANT INTERFACE
ELEMENTS OF THE BASS GUITAR
Since the goal of this project was to harness the embodied
skill of expert bass guitarists for control of electronic syn-
thesis, the first step was to determine which elements of the
interface were important to preserve, and which could be
simplified or ignored. The most obvious important points of
interaction with the bass guitar are the right hand plucking
the strings and the left hand fretting the strings at differ-
ent points along the neck to select pitches. As this project
was undertaken simultaneously with the development of the
Electrosteel, we aimed to reuse the same technology for both
wherever possible.
In many ways, the right hand interface is very similar be-
tween the electric bass and the pedal steel guitar (PSG),
which was the model for the Electrosteel. The strings are
plucked and damped, and both plucking amplitude and the
moment of damping need to be sensed to achieve a reason-
able model of the plucking action. However, while the PSG
has metal fingerpicks on each finger (and a thumbpick), the
bass is played either directly with the fingers or with a flat-
pick, and both of those interaction behaviors were deemed
important to preserve.
The left hand on an electric bass presses the strings against
the fretboard. Unlike the PSG, where a single bar moves
along all strings, and this interaction can be sensed with ei-
ther a single point along the neck or two points interpolated
across the neck, on an electric bass, all four strings could be
fretted at independent points, requiring individual sensing.
While the PSG has many more additional interface ele-
ments to contend with, such as knee levers and pedals, the
electric bass is much simpler, with two knobs completing the
compliment of salient interface elements. There are several
other details that enable the use of these interface elements,
such as the shape of the body and how it positions the neck
and the strings with relation to the player, but as for the

direct interface, there is little else to emulate.
3. THE ELECTROBASS INTERFACE EL-
EMENTS
Early on in the development of this project, some design
decisions had to be made about the concept of the instru-
ment. Commercial guitar synthesizers exist, and many of
them serve the purpose of putting electronic synthesis un-
der the control of a guitarist. The most well-known versions
do synthesis by converting the signal from an actual guitar,
fitted with individual per-string pickups, into midi signals
that can control a synthesizer. While this can work accept-
ably for a guitar, doing pitch detection on signals in the bass
guitar range involves large latencies, making this approach
unsatisfactory for bass players. Additionally, if part of the
goal is to have a more synth-like control over elements of
the sound like envelope, a pitch-tracking approach means
that the envelope decay length is limited by the decay time
of the physical string; Once it has stopped ringing you lose
the ability to track it. The desirability of extremely long
sustain times and the difficulty of pitch-tracking the bass
register were decisive in driving this project toward an ab-
stracted approach to the interface, where the left and right
hand systems are sensed independently.
3.1 Right Hand Sensing
For the right hand, it was quickly determined that using
actual strings, spaced as they are on a bass guitar, would
give the most playable emulation of the right hand interface.
Four short strings are positioned under the right hand, with
their own bridge and nut, both on the body. Attack detec-
tion is done in a manner similar to the Electrosteel, with
single-string electromagnetic pickups sending signal through
an ADC to a microcontroller running an attack-detection
algorithm. After attacks, the next feature of right-hand
plucking that must be distinguished is a muting action.
If the player touches the string with the right hand after
plucking it, the vibration is stopped. In the Electrobass, as
with the Electrosteel, we detect this gesture with capacitive
touch sensing, using the string itself as the conductive sen-
sor. While this works very well in the Electrosteel, where
the player traditionally has metal picks on each finger, this
can be less reliable on the Electrobass. Unfortunately, work-
ing professional bassists tend to have calloused fingers from
playing, and this reduces the conductivity of the fingers for
the capacitance sensing. This is a problem that we are still

aiming to solve.
Another concern is that this type of mute sensing doesn’t
work with standard plastic flatpicks. Metal picks do work
with the sensing technology, but they feel much stiffer than
standard picks and require adjustment of technique.
3.2 Left Hand Sensing
On the left hand of the Electrobass, our primary goal is
to sense the position of the fingers on each string. We set
out with the goal that Electrobass could be both fretted
and fretless, with a button to change the naturally fret-
less behavior into a quantized “fretted mode”. Therefore,
we aimed to sense continuous position rather than discrete
steps. This was also motivated by a desire to use the same
technology between both Electrobass and Electrosteel, and
the Electrosteel required continuous linear sensing. As with
the Electrosteel, we created a custom PCB with resistive
carbon ink, and designed a sensing system using a constant-
current DAC (see the Electrosteel paper for details).
One major technique that is crucial for bass but not for
the PSG is left-hand muting. A bass player, in addition
to sometimes muting strings with the right hand, can also
mute strings with the left hand by lifting the finger up to
release the string from the fretboard, while still touching the
string enough to damp its vibration. The solution on the
Electrobass is to have the left-hand strings also be capacitive
sensors, registering touch. Now, three states can be sensed.
(Table 1)
This allows for naturalistic bass playing technique, with
one caveat. The transition between state 3 and state 2
should result in a stable note being muted, but the fretboard
sensor registers the lifting of the finger as an increase in
resistance as the states change. This reads as a drop in

pitch before the mute, as it can’t be disambiguated from a
downward slide without additional sensing.
A solution to this problem was found2 by adding a second
ADC channel reading the voltage on the opposite end of the
resistive strip. When the finger is lifted off of the fretboard,
the resistance increases on both sides of the strip, but when
the finger slides downward, the resistance increases on the
body side, but decreases on the headstock side. This allows
for disambiguation of the two gestures.
One interesting aspect of the “quantized fretting” option
is that the frets can be set to any arbitrary tuning system.
The player can play as though in equal temperament but
the instrument can snap the pitches to any alternate tuning
the player desires.
4. SYNTHESIS
The Electrobass is designed with the same onboard synthe-
sis circuitry as the Electrosteel, and is similarly programmed
with the Electrosynth plugin developed by the authors.
5. RESULTS
So far, 6 copies of the current Electrobass prototype have
been constructed. A piece, called “Semaphore”, for a quar-
tet of Electrobasses, accompanied by Electrosteel, was com-
posed by the primary author and performed by electronic
music ensemble Sideband on a tour in the Spring of 2023.
In “Semaphore” the performers on the instrument were
not bassists, but approached the instrument with excite-
ment and were able to play it confidently after a week of re-
hearsals. However, the performances took place before the
“left hand mute” glitch mentioned above had been solved,
so avoiding that glitch was a distraction. The instruments
were used in “quantized fretted” mode with an alternate
Just Intonation tuning, which allowed for some beautiful
and unusual harmonies across the instruments. At the per-
formers’ request, the authors added a mode where vibrato
is allowed to pass through the fretboard quantization, and
they found that increased the expression greatly.
One clear success of the instrument was that the avoid-
ance of pitch-tracking and the integration of embedded syn-
thesis helped it achieve a very low latency. All players who
tried the instrument remarked that they could perceive no
delay in the response. Measurements on the current proto-
type show a latency measurement from the sensor attack to
the start of the synthesis audio output to be around 6ms,
well within the generally cited bounds of acceptable latency

6. FUTURE WORK
One powerful expressive parameter on an electric bass is
plucking position on the string. We currently have no sensi-
tivity to this on the Electrobass, so incorporating a system
that could detect pluck position is a future goal, perhaps
taking inspiration from Temprano[7], as sensing the angle
of the string could also determine the pluck position.
Other potential sources for useful sensor data would be
a sensor that detects a palm pressed against the bridge, or
the addition of an IMU to sense position of the neck.
We are currently working to find a way to improve the
mute sensing for players with calloused fingers. That re-
mains the most significant stumbling block to the success
of the instrument at its original goal.
The next step in the Electrobass project is to get the
instruments into the hands of players and collect feedback.
This will be happening over the next year.
