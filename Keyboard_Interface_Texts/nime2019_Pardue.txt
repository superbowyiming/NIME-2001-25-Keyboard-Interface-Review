ABSTRACT
When designing an augmented acoustic instrument, it is of-
ten of interest to retain an instrument’s sound quality and
nuanced response while leveraging the richness of digital
synthesis. Digital audio has traditionally been generated
through speakers, separating sound generation from the in-
strument itself, or by adding an actuator within the instru-
ment’s resonating body, imparting new sounds along with
the original. We oﬀer a third option, isolating the play-
ing interface from the actuated resonating body, allowing
us to rewrite the relationship between performance action
and sound result while retaining the general form and feel
of the acoustic instrument. We present a hybrid acoustic-
electronic violin based on a stick-body electric violin and
an electrodynamic polyphonic pick-up capturing individual
string displacements. A conventional violin body acts as
the resonator, actuated using digitally altered audio of the
string inputs. By attaching the electric violin above the
body with acoustic isolation, we retain the physical playing
experience of a normal violin along with some of the acous-
tic ﬁltering and radiation of a traditional build. We propose
the use of the hybrid instrument with digitally automated
pitch and tone correction to make an easy violin for use as
a potential motivational tool for beginning violinists.

1. INTRODUCTION
Two common motivations for designing augmented instru-
ments are to extend the sonic capabilities of an existing
instrument, or to repurpose the player’s existing skill and
technique on a traditional instrument. In contrast to tra-
ditional acoustic instruments, where sound production is
inherently tied to physical construction and energy input
from the player, it is common with developing digital or
augmented instruments to segment the design into separa-
ble modules: interface, processing, sound output.
Most commonly, processing is done on a computer with
sound then output to a speaker or public address system,
physically separating the sonic output of the instrument
from the interface. Separating the two not only alters an
instrument’s directionality and sonic presence, but also re-
sults in the loss of immediacy and subtle haptic feedback
many performers rely on [22].
Actuated musical instruments are those instruments ar-
tiﬁcially excited to create new timbres and sounds [22]. On
string instruments, magnetic actuation of the strings is com-
monly used to create new sounds and means of control. Ex-
amples include the commercially available Sustainiac [12]
and Vo-961, Berdahl’s Feedback Resonance Guitar [22, 3]
and McPherson’s magnetic resonator piano [17].
Another subset of actuated musical instruments are those
using active acoustics with structure-borne sound drivers in-
ducing vibration into a resonating body [16]. Active acous-
tics can be used to alter and control normal acoustic be-
haviours, exciting speciﬁc modes to modify timbre, or counter
naturally occurring phenomena like cello wolf tones [20]. IR-
CAM’s Smart Instruments project focuses on active instru-
ment control in a variety of instruments including bowed
strings [1], metallophones [4], and woodwinds [19].
Active acoustics can also be used to add a wide range of
standard audio eﬀects to an otherwise acoustic instrument.
This approach is particularly popular for guitars with com-
mercial examples such as the Tonewood Amp2, Tonik3, and
Yamaha’s Transacoustic Guitar4. L ¨ahdeoja discusses build-

ing active acoustic guitars in [16, 15]. The Chameleon Gui-
tar by Zoran et al. [30] takes the inverse approach, sensing
and modelling acoustic soundboards but retaining external
speakers for the ﬁnal sound.
Active acoustic instruments beneﬁt from retaining a fa-
miliar sound and feel, but a signiﬁcant drawback is that
they are additive: the sound of the acoustic instrument is
retained. This limits any transformation that seeks to re-
tain the technique and feel of a traditional instrument but
alter its original sound.
This paper presents an alternative hybrid acoustic-electronic
approach similar to active acoustics, but where the physical
inputs of the instrument are acoustically separated from the
resonating body. Overholt’s Overtone Fiddle [21] demon-
strates normal violin actuation exciting a separated carbon-
ﬁbre acoustic body hung beneath. Similar to more recent
revisions of L¨ahdeoja’s guitar [10], we take Overholt’s design
a step closer to an active acoustic violin, using a traditional
violin body as resonating chamber. Note that if there is no
goal of restoring acoustic sound characteristics, one could
simply attach small loudspeakers to an electric violin, as
seen in [23] or the Fusion guitar 5.
We have built a new violin which we informally call the
svampolin designed to maintain similar sound and feel to the
traditional violin, but with the capability of sonic substitu-
tion. In this paper we will present: the svampolin’s physical
build; a custom-designed electrodynamic pickup capturing
the velocity of each string with minimal cross-talk or body
coloration; and the actuation of the physical violin body.
We then present an example application of the svampolin
as a simpliﬁed violin for beginners, where we use automated
real-time pitch correction to improve player intonation and
real-time bowed-string feature extraction to regulate the
timbre. The resulting instrument retains a similar response
to the player as an acoustic violin, and use of a traditional
violin body as resonator restores many of the acoustic sound
characteristics, making it viable as a potential motivational
tool in violin learning.
2. INSTRUMENT DESIGN
The svampolin (Figures 1 and 2) comprises an electric“stick”
violin with a custom pick-up, an acoustic violin body with
no strings, a vibration actuator, an embedded computer,
and foam and string to clamp the two violins together.

The stick violin is made by Slawomir Ganiec6. It provides
the ﬁngerboard, bridge and strings to support the core play-
ing interactions7, while the actuated acoustic body (with no
ﬁngerboard or bridge attached) provides the sonic output.
2.1 Electrodynamic Pickup
Our instrument features a pickup whose design is based on
the StringAmpTM system by Michael Edinger of MusikLab
Denmark.8 The principle of operation is electrodynamic,
where according to Faraday’s Law a wire moving in a mag-
netic ﬁeld leads to an induced voltage proportional to the
velocity and the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. However,
rather than the traditional arrangement used in electric gui-
tars, where the string modulates the magnetic ﬁeld which
is then picked up by a stationery coil of wire, in our ar-
rangement the string itself acts as the wire carrying the
induced voltage. All strings are grounded at the scroll end,
and the voltage on each string at the tailpiece is passed into
a low-noise preampliﬁer described in the next section.
To provide the ambient magnetic ﬁeld, neodymium mag-
nets are placed underneath each string near the bridge (Fig-
ure 3). We found it convenient to place them close to the
bridge, where they could be installed on a laser-cut platform
without permanent modiﬁcation to the violin. Since the sig-
nal level is proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld strength, the
magnets should be placed as close to the strings as possible,
making placement near the bridge more convenient as the
string will have a smaller range of vertical displacement due
to bow pressure.
This pickup arrangement has several advantages. First,
the signal captures the motion of the string in the horizon-

ence of a ﬁfth string is not core to the implementation, and

tal plane, the same plane as the stick-slip motion of bow-
ing. Second, since ﬁeld strength is approximately constant
for small movements, the signal is a clean representation
of string velocity at the point along its length where the
magnet is placed, with minimal contribution from bridge
and body resonances. This allows the application of ana-
lytical models derived from bowed string physics, described
further in Section 3. Third, the design can easily be made
polyphonic, with a separate signal for each string and min-
imal crosstalk.
2.2 Preampliﬁer
For the pickup to work eﬀectively, each string must be con-
ductive along the full length, which is true of many but
not all violin strings. The combination of extremely low
source impedance and low signal level (no more than a few
millivolts full-scale) presents a noise-ﬂoor challenge for any
preampliﬁer. Our design, which is shown in Figure 4, dif-
fers signiﬁcantly from the original StringAmp preamp in
architecture and purpose. Where StringAmp is a single-
channel preamp targeted at producing the highest possible
sound quality for live ampliﬁcation, our application instead
calls for a linear polyphonic transducer for real-time digi-
tal signal processing. Our design is based on the OPA1612
op-amp which features extremely low voltage noise density
of 1.1nV/
√
Hz. R1 and R2 are thin ﬁlm resistors, with the
smaller than usual 3 .3Ω value of R1 minimising the John-
son (thermal) noise in the feedback path. The low source
impedance of the string means that Johnson noise is negli-
gible in the source signal itself.
In Figure 4, the gain is set by 1 + R2 /R1 ≈304, with
C1 providing a high-frequency rolloﬀ, and a further second-
order lowpass ﬁlter following in the second stage with a cor-

trodynamic string pickups (one per string).
ner frequency of 1 /(2πR3C3) ≈21.9kHz. A bipolar power
supply is required for the ﬁrst stage. C2 and R5 allow the
second stage to be referenced to an oﬀset voltage V com,
which in our application is set to 2V to centre the signal
within the input range of an analog-to-digital converter.
2.3 Digital Processing
The output of each string is processed using a Bela Mini [18]
embedded computer, which enables real-time signal process-
ing with submillisecond latencies, meaning that the only
meaningful latency arises from the DSP algorithms them-
selves. Each signal is sampled at 44.1kHz with 16-bit res-
olution. The Bela Mini is physically installed between the
stick-violin and the acoustic body. It is currently powered
through an oﬀ-board battery.
2.4 Actuation
A 30W Tectonic TEAX32C30 vibration transducer is in-
stalled on the acoustic body with specialised adhesive. The
choice and placement of actuator was determined empir-
ically based on sound quality, and our choice follows the
recommendation of L¨ahdeoja [15].
We tried actuating a violin with and without sound post
and found that having no sound post resulted in better vi-
bration transference. Similarly, we tested diﬀerent locations
on the top and bottom of the violin, including over the
bass bar, and decided to place the actuator roughly where
a sound post might be. We opted to attach the violin body
upside-down so that the violin’s f-holes point toward the
ﬂoor. We did this for two reasons: we felt yielded it better
sound radiation, and pointing upward at volumes audible
to an audience became prohibitively loud for the player.
For practical reasons, our current instrument mounts the
transducer outside of the violin body. Guitars have the
beneﬁt that the sound hole is large enough to reach inside
to mount an actuator, but installing an actuator within the
violin requires removing and reglueing the top. We intend to
revisit this possibility at a later stage. We will also explore
the use of more than one actuator. L ¨ahdeoja [15] discusses
how using two actuators on diﬀerent planes yielded the best
perceptual frequency response and most natural radiation
characteristics within an active acoustic guitar.
The actuator is currently powered by a TPA3118 30W
class-D audio ampliﬁer (using an inexpensive commercial
breakout board). This ampliﬁer produces suﬃcient volume
but we ﬁnd it to be noisy and failure-prone, and it requires
an oﬀ-board 24V power supply.
2.5 Assembly and isolation
The stick-violin and acoustic body are held together with
straps and adhesive, with a thick foam between them for
sound isolation. We found this relatively simple approach
280
to be suﬃcient, though we also considered various vibration-
dampening caulks. Isolation was assessed by placing a pickup
on the acoustic body with no actuator. We found that the
vibration of the strings on the electric violin produced only
small vibrations in the body (though the strings also couple
to the air directly, making a quiet but audible sound which
is readily masked by the actuation if driven at appropri-
ate volume). Similarly, vibrations from the actuator do not
couple strongly to the strings, meaning that feedback is not
a problem in the applications we have tested.
Future directions can include other types of foam with
improved damping characteristics, or ideally, a design where
the acoustic body is entirely suspended from the stick-body
using tensioned cables.
3. APPLICATIONS
By retaining playing technique and physical familiarity, the
svampolin’s decoupling of interaction and sound opens up
a wealth of extended performance opportunities through
audio eﬀects or novel synthesis techniques. One of our
own primary motivations was to investigate technological
intervention in instrument learning, in particular, the idea
of complexity management : the transient simpliﬁcation of
an eventually complex instrument in order to optimize the
learning rewards cycle [26].
Successful ﬂuency and expertise on an instrument re-
quires sustained practice, which in turn requires motivation.
As Kohut writes:
...most people, regardless of training, can dif-
ferentiate between extremely poor and good per-
formance.... This can be, and often is, a negative
factor in terms of motivation for continued prac-
tice after the ﬁrst two or three months of study.
Good students in particular become frustrated if
the tonal results they achieve are poor. But once
tone and intonation improve suﬃciently, prac-
tice comes easier, because it is more fun when
one sounds better. [14, p.9]
Though a few months of incompetence might be tolera-
ble for a teenager learning a popular wind instrument, for a
challenging new instrument with unknown capacity for vir-
tuosity or an existing instrument that requires longer study
to master basic tone production, the patience to continue
practicing without musical reward may be too much.
With both basic tone and intonation requiring concerted
attention at ﬁrst, the violin requires intensive long-term
commitment prior to musical success. Further, unlike the
piano, where a melody can be played on one hand, the violin
requires bimanual skill for even the most rudimentary mu-
sical result. As Tasmin Little stated 9, “...you can be doing
everything right on the violin, but as 90% of tonal produc-
tion comes from the bow, as long as your bow isn’t working,
nothing is going to work.”
The svampolin was designed partly to study whether ar-
tiﬁcially simplifying intonation or tone (or both) provides
beginning learners suﬃcient musical reward to improve their
motivation to practice. A related question is whether sim-
plifying the violin results in incorrect learning that disad-
vantages the player when the simpliﬁcations are removed
(i.e. guidance eﬀects [8]). For instance, a key part of learn-
ing is understanding the link between action and sound. Ar-
tiﬁcially correcting intonation may lead the player to sound

better but also inhibit the ability to hear and correct errors,
with consequences for later performance on an acoustic vi-
olin.
In [24], we explored the eﬀects of full and partial pitch
correction on expert and beginner intonation using violin
augmentation techniques presented in [25]. In those ex-
periments we used headphones for pitch-corrected audio.
However, headphones had drawbacks in bulkiness and sup-
pression of sound from the room. The svampolin oﬀers im-
provements in these respects.
We currently have two applications, one altering intona-
tion, and the other tone quality.
3.1 Easier violin through pitch correction
With intonation, it is easy to both deﬁne error 10 and then
correct it. Based on software described in depth in [24,
p.181-186], we created an equal-temperament always-in-tune
violin. Polyphonic correction is achieved by correcting each
string separately. First, in order to remove noise from the
current hardware design, input signals from each string are
ﬁltered above 4kHz and below 100Hz using 2nd-order ﬁlters.
Next, we use a real-time optimized version of Yin [7] for
pitch detection and a modiﬁed version of Tom Baran’s Auto-
talent11, which uses a time-domain based pitch synchronous
overlap-add algorithm, for pitch correction.
As Bela only has suﬃcient processing power to pitch cor-
rect three strings, while we always correct the A and D
strings, correction of the G and E strings is based on which
of the two strings is higher volume. Pitch corrected signals
are then mixed together for driving the actuator.
In order to accurately detect pitch with sub-12ms latency,
we previously used a physical sensor to capture ﬁnger place-
ment on the ﬁngerboard [25], however using the electro-
dynamic pick-up presented earlier, string signals are clean
enough that (although we have not numerically evaluated
its performance) we ﬁnd qualitatively that audio-only pitch
correction at low latency still produces nearly error-free re-
sults. Audible errors are almost exclusively restricted to the
early transients and ﬁnal decay of a note.
Moreover, though we can program the svampolin to snap
strictly to the nearest semitone, we can also correct intona-
tion only partially, allowing some heard intonation error, or
even exaggerate intonation error to highlight mistakes.
3.2 Easier violin through tone regulation
Unlike equal-temperament intonation, identifying good tone
and correspondingly how to correct poor tone within an au-
dio signal is not as straightforward. However, it is possible
to rectify the tone quality to a certain degree in that we can
deﬁne a signal model for the desired tone, and then enforce
a measured violin signal to be coherent with that target
signal model.
3.2.1 General technique
To deﬁne the desired signal model, it is necessary to examine
how bowed string vibrations operate. Helmholtz observed
that the bowed string vibrates in a lateral triangular shape,
with the corner of the triangular travelling up and down be-
tween the nut and the bridge. Each time when the corner
passes under the bow, the interaction between the bow and
the string switches between a sticking and a slipping state
10Intonation error is easily deﬁned within the context of
equal-temperament. Expert violinists regularly use other
tuning systems or deviate from equal-temperament for ex-
pressive reasons, but for a beginner, we consider it reason-
able to base intonation on equal-temperament.

[28]. Raman [27] later theorized that, making the assump-
tion that the string displacement is lossless and the string is
ultimately ﬂexible, the measured string displacement indeed
gives a triangular signal, whose duty cycle , deﬁned as the
ratio between the lengths of the positive and negative slopes
within the period, corresponds to the relative measurement
position along the string [29] (as illustrated in Figure 3 12)
and can be modeled as such.
In practice the interplay of string losses and stiﬀness,
complex bow-string interaction characteristics, and the feed-
back of the violin body to the string cause deviations from
the straightforward triangular model, e.g. the duty cycle
can change, the corners of the signal become rounded [6]
and some particular phenomena such as multiple ﬂybacks,
multiple slipping or raucous motions can occur [11].
The simplicity of the string motion signals inspired us
to design a time-domain algorithm that approximates the
original signal with straight line segments (separated by
break-points), to enable the extraction of precise and un-
ambiguous tone quality features. A ﬁrst implementation of
such an algorithm was designed in earlier work [5]. In that
algorithm, initial break-point locations are detected with a
simple RMS-threshold technique (which is reasonably accu-
rate given the pertinent displacement signal shape). Next,
the break-point locations are optimized by minimizing the
error between the linear segmented model and the data, us-
ing an iterative regression method. This implementation
enables the precise and real-time estimation of the funda-
mental frequency, amplitude and duty cycle of the string’s
displacement signal.
Recently, the algorithm has been extended to include an
estimation of the corner rounding, enabling a more accurate
and precise analysis of the tone quality. The previous algo-
rithm could be adapted to perform a segmented regression
of the velocity signal. As the rounded displacement corners
can be approximated by parabolas, the velocity signal can
be modelled as a sloped straight line, alternated by the zero-
slope segments corresponding to the stick and slip states of
the bow-string interaction, which results in a trapezoidal
velocity signal model. Hence, the computational task re-
mains a linear segmented regression, with added zero-slope
constraints, which provides an unambiguous model that is
implementable with the same mathematical approach re-
quiring minimal code adaptation.
Figure 5 shows an example of a captured velocity signal
and a resulting segmentation.

up location.
3.2.2 Discussion
We have carried out initial tests with both an expert and be-
ginning violin player and observed how indeed, notes played
to a classically correct standard abide well to the trapezoidal
velocity signal model, while notes played with poor playing
technique resulted in many tone quality perturbations that
deviate from the model. Many (small) perturbations, typ-
ically occurring in the vicinity of a good playing style, do
not signiﬁcantly alter the linearly segmented approxima-
tion. Hence, they can be simply erased by enforcing the
model, resulting in a what could be considered corrected
tone quality. However, remaining work requires including
perturbations currently excluded from the model that still
inﬂuence the model parameters. For instance, raucous tones
tend to produce chaotically ﬂuctuating parameters, which
could be corrected by ﬁltering the parameters when sus-
tained oscillation regimes are detected.
Both automatically correcting intonation error, and forc-
ing string signals to adhere to an idealized physical model
are performed with the intent to make basic sound pro-
duction easier for a beginner. However these are artiﬁcial
disruptions of normal violin behaviors which may be un-
settling for highly-practiced performers, something we have
already seen in our study looking at the experts’ experience
of pitch correction [24, pp. 192-241]. Further, our simpli-
ﬁcations come at the cost of limiting expressivity, though
there is reason to believe this trade-oﬀ is beneﬁcial when
matched to user skill [13].
4. CONCLUSIONS
Any of the components in Section 2 can be used indepen-
dently. The pickup system in particular oﬀers an easily-
implemented high-performance approach to per-string sens-
ing on any instrument with conductive strings, whether or
not the strings are ferromagnetic. Below we comment on
some of the possibilities for combining sensing and actua-
tion.
4.1 Substitution, not Addition
The beneﬁts of collocated interaction and sound production
are well-established [22]. The most common approach to
collocated string instrument augmentation is to start with
an instrument with a direct mechanical action-to-sound cou-
pling, then add further sonic layers through actuating the
strings [3, 17], soundboard [16, 2] or resonant cavity [9].
The starting point could be an existing specimen of instru-
ment or a purpose-built acoustic system as in ´Ulfarsson’s
Halldorophone [9] or Overholt’s Overtone Fiddle [21]. In
any of these cases, the direct acoustic coupling from action
to sound hinders sonic transformations where the original
sound is not helpful, such as pitch shifting, attenuation or
timbre changes that are not purely additive.
Further, our motivational target is to help beginners learn
violin and implicit in that is the end goal that they be able
to play an unaugmented violin. To work, both pedagogi-
cally and motivationally, players need to feel like they are
playing a real violin. This rules out a violin interface linked
to speakers and clearly, if an active acoustic violin was pro-
ducing audible acoustic sound along with the corrected au-
dio, it would be highly disruptive. Hence a hybrid actuated
violin is the only viable option.
Our approach mostly avoids the obstacle of direct acous-
tic sound. Any electric violin will produce some audible
sound via direct string-to-air or string-to-bow-hair coupling,
but this can be largely masked by an actuated sound of
ordinary volume. However, an important consideration in
the substitution approach is to maintain the subtlety of in-
282
teraction of the original instrument, which no longer ﬂows
automatically from the acoustic coupling, but instead must
be supported by the digital signal processing system. High
sampling bandwidth and low latency are important condi-
tions, and ideally, any DSP system should have a robust,
predictable response that supports the sensorimotor train-
ing of the player.
4.2 Future Design Directions
The svampolin shares many similarities with the familiar
acoustic violin. Its sound shares certain characteristics but
is not identical. Apart from the ﬁve-string stick violin, two
other notable diﬀerences are its extra weight and the fact
that the strings are elevated with respect to the chin rest.
We do not ﬁnd the added weight to be a problem, though
future redesigns should either lower the strings or raise the
chin rest. Other practical improvements could include uni-
ﬁed on-board power for the processor and ampliﬁers, elim-
inating all need for cables, and a robust physical assembly
that travels more easily and can ﬁt in a regular violin case,
with or without some modular assembly.
