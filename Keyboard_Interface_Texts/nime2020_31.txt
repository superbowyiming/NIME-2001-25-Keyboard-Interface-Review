ABSTRACT
So far, NIME research has been mostly inward-looking, ded-
icated to divulging and studying our own work and hav-
ing limited engagement with trends outside our community.
Though musical instruments as cultural artefacts are inher-
ently political, we have so far not suﬃciently engaged with
confronting these themes in our own research. In this pa-
per we argue that we should consider how our work is also
political, and begin to develop a clear political agenda that
includes social, ethical, and cultural considerations throug h
which to consider not only our own musical instruments,
but also those not created by us. Failing to do so would re-
sult in an unintentional but tacit acceptance and support of
such ideologies. We explore one item to be included in this
political agenda: the recent trend in music technology of
“democratising music” , which carries implicit political ide-
ologies grounded in techno-solutionism. We conclude with
a number of recommendations for stimulating community-
wide discussion on these themes in the hope that this leads
to the development of an outward-facing perspective that
fully engages with political topics.

1. INTRODUCTION
Evidence of NIME’s maturity as a research community has
been identiﬁed as the production of a considerable amount
of self-reﬂective work [38, 30]. While most of this work has
adocumentary function (e.g. consolidating research meth-
ods [9], comparing techniques and input modalities [52], and
identifying common evaluation approaches [3]), some of this
self-reﬂection has beeninquisitive, aimed at pinpointing ar-

eas of improvement, such as the recent debate on the limited
adoption and longevity of new instruments created by the
NIME community [37, 16].
Recently, this self-reﬂection has begun to turn to political
issues, such as the lack of gender parity within NIME and
related communities [7, 55, 14] and issues around accessibil-
ity [18]. Instead of being wholly situated inside NIME, these
discussions engage with what is also happeningoutside. In
the case of gender diversity, these discussions have begun
to question and apply critiques to music technology more
broadly [45, 47]. In addition to the inherent beneﬁts of
including political discourse in our ongoing conversations,
this has also paved the way for a shift in critical studies
at NIME: a shift moving frominward-looking to outward-
looking; i.e. a shift from reﬂections on our own doings to
reﬂections on the outside world’s doings in the context of
new musical instruments.
In this paper, we argue that NIME should more fully em-
brace this shift, and expand our discussions to engage with
the political issues inherent in new musical instruments1 –
both our own, as well as those made by others. Notwith-
standing the host of political topics that intersect with mu-
sical instruments, NIME has no explicit political agenda.
Though we self-describe as a place for “researchers and mu-
sicians from all over the world to share their knowledge and
late-breaking work on new musical interface design”2, which
suggests that a wide-reaching perspective already exists, in
fact almost all new instruments presented at the conference
are created by the authors themselves [37]. In short: we
have so far neglected to suﬃciently engage in critical work
with the world outside of NIME.
In this paper, we explain why this lack of critical work
should be a matter of concern. With a few notable ex-
ceptions [32], our community has overlooked political issues
connected to new instruments. This might be due to reasons
such as an outward-looking perspective running counter to
the practical, geeky, crafty interests of most members rather
than any intentional negligence or self-indulgence. What-
ever the reason for this lack of engagement with the word
outside, we believe that NIME should not only examine the
political issues aﬀecting what we create, but also develop
ways of understanding, discussing and critiquing trends in
the outside world.
1In this paper we use musical instruments as an umbrella
term to indicate all those instruments that include some
sort of computer technology that are elsewhere referred to
using terms such as NIMEs and DMIs.

The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we aim to
bring attention to how new musical instruments embody
a host of political ideologies, and we illustrate this by ex-
amining instruments from theoutside world. We detail our
concern for the lack of scrutiny from our community on how
our research connects to the world outside, and suggest that
this lack of interest may unintentionally but implicitly sup-
port speciﬁc ideologies.
Second, we propose that, despite some engagement with
political issues like gender diversity [7, 55, 45, 47], open re -
search [22], and inclusion [18, 26], NIME continues to lack
any explicitly articulated political positions, let alone a di-
versity of positions that could form the basis for productive
debate. We then oﬀer starting points for discussion through
which political agendas for NIME could develop, grounded
in theories that feature social, ethical, and cultural consid-
erations, aimed not only developing critique of new instru-
ments but also highlighting their potential consequences.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Critical perspectives in HCI
NIME researchers have repeatedly drawn inspiration from
methodologies [50], tools [52], and frameworks [35] typical of
HCI. Recently, HCI scholars have produced a body of work
aimed at discussing political and ethical considerations of
interaction design and exposing its consequences [46, 4, 36,
23], yet NIME has not followed this trend.
A signiﬁcant corpus of politically-motivated work in HCI
is rooted in political theories and movements, the most
prominent example being Participatory Design (PD)[48, 2].
PD emerged in the 1970s, a time and context where social
democratic ideologies were thriving. The driving ethos of
PD was to redistribute agency in the workplace by making
workers direct contributors to the development of informa-
tion technology [2]: design is a political issue because it
is a locus of power. Since then, PD has oﬀered numerous
theories and methodologies for involving users in the design
of technology, some of which – most notably User-Centred
Design – have evolved without political connotations.
In recent years, the HCI community has returned to con-
siderations of the social and political implications of thei r
work [4, 23]. Particular attention has been devoted to un-
derstanding who is included or excluded by technology and
its design, accounting for diﬀerences in ability [1], gender
[21], race [17], and class [23]. Though the tenor of these
discussions is clearly political and despite the emergence of
politically-oriented HCI work [23], some scholars contend
that political positions in HCI are not explicit enough [4,
25]. Researchers have argued that avoiding explicit politics
is not theabsence of politic, but rather a tacit acceptance of
the status quo [13, 23]: “Allowing political stances to remai n
unspoken has constrained our ability to question and chal-
lenge the consequences of the work we put into the world.
Further, this silence creates stumbling blocks for critique
and accountability mechanisms” [23].
We believe that, as a community, we should take a cue
from these positions in HCI. Despite small amounts of political ly-
engaged work that exists in the NIME literature, there is
a deﬁcit of these kinds of discussions on a larger scale. We
must consider that these conversations are overdue, and
what is at stake if we delay them any longer.
2.2 Critical perspectives at NIME
NIME members have been engaged with self-reﬂective crit-
ical work since the formation of the community. Initially,
this work aimed to structure our understanding of the tech-
nical aspects of DMIs (this objective predates the NIME
conference itself [51, 20, 42]), and on developing design
frameworks that could systematise and oﬀer guidance to
the design of new instruments [52, 35].
More recently, NIME scholars expanded the focus of criti-
cal investigations from the characteristics of the instruments
they design to the characteristics of the community to which
they belong. This body of work focuses on a variety of as-
pects that characterise NIME and satellite communities [30,
39, 33], the common research approaches [9] and evaluation
methodologies [3], and the typical values and intentions that
we embed in our instruments [28, 8, 38].
A number of critical studies have also begin referencing
political issues. Whether voluntary or not, these works em-
brace issues that were previously identiﬁed by HCI scholars
when examining matters of inclusion, such as accessibility
(who is included or excluded from/by the way we design
instruments?) and gender diversity (who is included or ex-
cluded from/by our community?). The theme of accessibil-
ity [18, 15, 26, 24, 41] has gained interest suﬃcient that this
is a theme of NIME 2020,3 and the theme of gender diver-
sity has been explored through papers [55, 45, 47, 14], work-
shops [7], and working groups (Women In Music Technol-
ogy4), as well as the establishment of the Pamela Z Award
For Innovation in 2018. However, these eﬀorts, along with
NIME’s 2018 diversity statement,5 represent only prelimi-
nary engagement with these issues, and this kind of work
represents only a very small portion of NIME’s output.
That being said, the emergence of these themes signals
that the NIME community’s attention is widening to in-
clude social issues. At the same time, these themes do not
articulate the totality of political issues that overlap with
NIME practice, and a wider perspective is needed. In the
next section we discuss other aspects that are important
for this community, the political impact of which might be
possibly less obvious but surely less discussed.
2.3 What is “political” for new instruments?
Musical instruments are inherently political, given their role
as tools of cultural production and cultural symbols, and
the political issues that exist here are as deep as they are
latent. These issues include: instruments as symbols of
status; learning instruments (especially from childhood) is
often the realm of the aﬄuent; the supremacy of Western
hegemony as Western classical music is the most ‘valuable’,
not to mention so much music technology being based on
Western musical systems; instruments outside Western tra-
ditions often being co-opted for novel interfaces. The list
goes on, and NIME is not apart from any of these realms
of critique.6
Moreover, NIME is not somehow immune from environ-
mental concerns and oppressive capitalistic systems. We
argue that we have not adequately engaged with the hid-
den environmental costs that are embedded in new musical
instruments (given the focus of this paper on theoutside,
we will not discuss the environmental costs connected to the
activities of the NIME community itself, such as conference
organisation and attendance). Notably, environmental costs
are not limited to the production and disposal phase, and
our analysis should also include environmental costs atrun

6To take one example, the NIME conference has mostly
been held in a small geographic region: Western/Northern
Europe (7 times), USA (5 times), Canada (twice), Australia
(twice), and once each in Japan, South Korea, and Brazil;
also, the majority of NIME submissions come from a small
set of Western, mostly English-speaking, countries.

time (for instance the Machine-Learning-powered, resource-
intensive [49] instruments like Amazon’s forthcoming Deep-
Composer7).
Additionally, discussion of the environmental impact of
cheap and easily-available hardware components typically
used in new musical instruments is largely absent, from car-
bon footprint to working conditions in factories to the man-
ufacturing process itself. We believe that these analyses are
crucial as the drive for novelty at NIME often ends up ex-
plicitly promoting cutting-edge technologies (such as maker
processes, high performance computing, machine learning)
whose wide-scale environmental impact is largely unknown
and not yet discussed.
Issues of environmental and labour exploitation are only
a starting point for the task of analysing the political and
social responsibility of music technology. However, we hold
that it is important to consider and critically examine these
stages of production where political issues aresubcontracted.
In his “Political ecology of music” [11], Devine states that
when Spotify and other streaming companiessubcontract
processing needs to cloud companies like Amazon and Google,
they are also subcontracting “their consciousness of the en-
ergy intensity of digital music’s infrastructure” (ibid.), and
we argue that NIME cannot continue to oﬄoad or ignore
these impacts.
There are countless other important political issues that
relate to the design, manufacture, performance, study of,
access to, and learning with musical instruments. However,
this paper is not aimed to systematically map these issues,
but rather to broaden our discourse to include these types
of outward-looking socially engaged concerns. In the next
section we delve into one of these issues, which we believe is
one of the most pressing, with the call to other researchers
to analyse other political issues.
3. THE POLITICS OF ACCESS
Democratisationis most commonly used to indicate forms
of government based on self-legislation and participation
of citizens in political decisions. Recently, this term has
gained an additional meaning: the democratisation of a re-
source (such as technology, knowledge, or information) de-
scribes the process through which that resource becomes
more available or accessible to more people. The logic goes
thus: previously some sort of scarcity excluded access by
some part of the population to aresource, and then a break-
through happened that allowed more people to have access
to that resource. In the case of the “democratisation of tech-
nology” , the scarceresource was computational power and
hardware availability and the breakthrough was the techno-
logical innovation that reduced the costs of production.
3.1 “Everyone can make music”
In the last decade, the democratisation process has inﬁl-
trated virtually all areas of content-creation. The“democrati-
sation of music-making” is deﬁned by Park et al. as “aﬀord-
able, sophisticated, and cost-eﬀective technologies enabling
non-experts to engage in music-making, music exploration,
and music access” [40]. If we were to apply the logic pro-
posed above, this deﬁnition does not describe theresource
that was in short supply before, nor the breakthrough that
made this scarcity history.
When commerce intersects with this idealism, political
questions are thrown into high relief. It is useful to use a
case study of instruments designed for mass appeal to un-
pack political issues that intersect with this practice. Ev-
ery year dozens of new instruments speciﬁcally targeting
7https://aws.amazon.com/deepcomposer
non-musicians are developed for the commercial market,
and most of these instruments are funded via crowdfund-
ing campaigns. These campaigns often promise a musical
instrument thatanybody can play , as evidenced by these
three examples:
Jamstik ($813k raised):‘No experience needed; anyone
can just pick it up and play’ (controller to trigger sounds
from a mobile app).
Roli’s LUMI ($2.1M raised):‘The smarter way to learn’
for ‘anyone who ever wanted to play an instrument’ (key-
board with keys that light up in time).
Minim ($145k raised):‘We believe anyone can make
music, and that most people really want to’.
McPherson et al. express scepticism for this anyone can
play sentiment: “ Music is not one homogeneous entity but
rather an umbrella term encompassing a huge variety of
genres, styles and techniques. Few people would learn a
traditional instrument to generically create music of any
arbitrary style; most people are motivated to participate in
particular genres, often ones they also listen to” [32].
3.2 T echno-solutionism
The idea of an easily-accessible musical instrument is not
new and, in fact, far predates digital technology [32]. In-
ventors have been promising music for the masses for cen-
turies: the hurdy-gurdy, autoharp, harmonica, and Suzuki
Omnichord all promised to unlock the musician in anyone.
In the above examples non-musicians are portrayed as
frustrated individuals that have always wanted to make mu-
sic but are stymied by diﬃcult instruments. The problem is
simple and clear: instruments are ineﬃcient, and take a long
time to master. However, this attenuates, or perhaps out-
right disregards, deeper political and intersecting reasons
that a person may want to engage in music but is unable
to, such as exclusion because of socioeconomic resources, the
undervaluing of the arts in schools, time poverty imposed
by capitalist forces, exclusion from music-making communi-
ties because of gender, disability, body size, musical tastes
... just to name a few.
Instead, these examples frame a lack of musical ability
or training as a technical issue that can (or must) be ad-
dressed with technology. This kind of techno-solutionism
sees technology as the answer to virtually all problems [44],
and justiﬁes solutions as necessary answers to “deﬁciencies”
that are not deﬁciencies at all [34], and “presumes rather
than investigates the problems that it is trying to solve,
reachingfor answers before the questions have been fully
asked” [12].
In this way, “easiness” becomes the central concern when
measuring the quality of an instrument for novices. By sac-
riﬁcing complexity to achieve “easiness” , the “perfect musi-
cal instrument” can only ever be an over-simpliﬁed version
of music making. Notably, nowhere has it beendiscussed,
let alone proved, that an over-simpliﬁed instrument holds
any beneﬁts for a novice in the long term. This problema-
tising of music along with the disregard for the more subtle
and harder-to-address problems of a political nature, means
that this narrative argues fortechnological inevitability, the
belief that making things “easier” and “more eﬃcient” with
technology is always an appropriate and positive course of
action.
Adopting a techno-solutionist approach that reduces mu-
sic making to a simple and solvable problem, in turn, pro-
duces political and ideological eﬀects. Techno-solutionism
is aligned with a capitalist ideology [27] that simplistica lly
reduces a complex space of personally and artistically moti-
vated challenges to neoliberal convenience with the aims of
packaging and selling a solution. Ironically, the same capi-

162
talist ideology that reduced the monetary value of music by
pushing listeners to spend less on recorded music [11] now
seems to claim that no one should let their musical potential
go untapped by failing to buy a solution.
3.3 What NIME can learn
Though the above examples are from outside the NIME
community, we should acknowledge that NIME is not an
exception to solutionism. In fact NIME has, at times, re-
lied on this same kind of solutionist approach, perhaps as
an attempt to demonstrate quantiﬁable utility to academic
promotion committees and research funders. We also do
not levy criticism speciﬁcally at for-proﬁt music technol-
ogy, and acknowledge the wealth of knowledge, awareness,
and discourse on political issues in industry; further, there
are plenty of examples of blends between NIME research
and commercial outputs [53, 31]. What these examples are
intended to illustrate is the political content in musical in-
struments, the roots of solutionism, and the ways in which
a technology-focused approach can disregard many subtle
yet vitally important human considerations.
First and foremost, these examples illustrate that musical
instruments are intensely political. As cultural tools and
symbols musical instruments also take on political content
in many ways, particularly around access that is aﬀected by
physical ability, gender, socio-economic status, class, Euro-
centric worldviews, and cultural hierarchies.
Within NIME some work already exists in this domain
that challenges this worldview [19, 54], and there is some
awareness of these issues. From within NIME, McPherson
and colleagues state: “the ability to perform music may best
be viewed not as an engineering or societalproblem to be
solved, but as an open-ended creative opportunity where
new ideas will always be welcome and even necessary” [32].
We suspect that this stance is shared among the vast ma-
jority of NIME, and yet we have so far failed to begin deep
discussions on these topics, or develop a robust response.
As well as recognising these issues, the NIME community
can also beneﬁt from reﬂection on solutionism in our own
work, and which ends this approach has served or failed.
Morozov directly challenges techno-solutionism [34] using
the metaphor of cooking, stating that subjecting creative
activities to the logic of eﬃciency “is to deprive humans
of the ability to achieve mastery in this activity, to make
human ﬂourishing impossible and to impoverish our lives” .
He adds: “technology can actually make the cooking process
more challenging, opening up new vistas for experimenta-
tion and giving us new ways to violate the rules” . As well
as being a barrier to more subtle political aspects at play,
resorting to solutionism may discourage more productive
and exciting applications of technology. If we continue to
under-consider the issues at play and resort to simplifying
problems and creating the most straightforward solutions
in response, what are we losing?
It is also pertinent for NIME to consider the longevity
of instruments of the kind in the examples above and the
longevity of our own instruments. If the purpose of these
example instruments is to make money, then instruments
that are bought and used for years have limited commer-
cial beneﬁt; it makes sense then that these instruments are
used for a short period of time and set aside, and making an
environmental critique against this capitalistic behaviour is
easy to do. However, this short lifespan has also recently
been identiﬁed within NIME [37], which does not have any
necessary commercial ends. This should give us pause; if
we’re not bound by capitalistic ideology, why do we as a
community have an enduring focus on novelty? Is this fo-
cus a reﬂection of academic rather than artistic incentives?
What environmental and resource issues should we be con-
sidering as creators, and what issues have we, so far, failed
to notice?
4. A ST ARTING POINT
4.1 How NIME may be useful to other do-
mains
Though the community named NIME is only a few decades
old, the kind of technology-focused creative musical practice
that unites our work has a history of more than a century:
a long historical arc that includes a signiﬁcant amount of
iteration, writing, discussion, and development.
This considerable history also includes decades of work-
ing to understand what it is to create music with computa-
tional and electronic means, a form ofautotelic experience
that has no task and no purpose outside itself [10]. Only
relatively recently has the HCI community begun to engage
with interaction that has no task, and there is limited room
within HCI scholarship for such artistically-motivated re-
search that occurs largely through practice. As Bin states,
“the concerns of DMI research are not conﬁned to a curious
corner of HCI scholarship where people make weird mu-
sic” , and that this long tradition of exploring what it means
to create artistic works with computers means that “this
community may have a monumental head start in insight
and knowledge in this realm” [6]. This means that we not
only have the opportunity to deepen and enrich our own
discourse, but because this community is one with decades
of experience in what is emerging in other ﬁelds as a new
phenomenon, we may have useful insight to oﬀer to others.
4.2 Practical suggestions
We do not intend for this paper to oﬀer conclusions or
solutions to these problems, as these can only be devel-
oped through community-wide discussion. However, we
have identiﬁed some starting points for these political posi-
tions to be explored and developed, and oﬀer some practical
suggestions to start this conversation.
1. Deepen current conversations, and start new
ones. Recently, there has been engagement within NIME
on the themes of accessibility and gender diversity, and
these are starting points from which we can go further with
greater momentum and purpose. For example, there is cur-
rent discussion about designing instruments for one-handed
musicians [18], but this discussion has not yet extended to,
for instance, examining whether making accessibility a sep-
arate topic of discussion further marginalises disabled mu-
sicians, or how (or even if) non-disabled researchers should
be speaking for this community. We suggest that we begin
with these existing themes and go deeper, in order to take
on these larger questions as well as spark new discussions
that can foster the connections between our work and the
outside world.
2. Scrutinise new commercial instruments. The
most immediate and straightforward action is to extend
NIME’s focus to new commercial musical instruments, shar-
ing the responsibility of identifying their socio-cultural and
ideological implications with other scholars already doing s o
[5, 43]. We suggest that NIME researchers should engage
in empirical, ethnographic, and performative investigations
of these instruments, and that the NIME conference should
explicitly welcome these contributions in order to foster this
discussion and develop this vein of research.
3. Avoid solutionism and inevitability . Technol-
ogy communities often blindly accept ideologies of solution -
ism, inevitabilism, and utopianism [34, 56]. However, as
Zuboﬀ points out, “inevitability is the opposite of politics
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020
163
and history” [56], and utopias often “harbor an element of
determinism” [29]. For this reason, we should take a criti-
cal stance on technological innovation for its own sake, and
reﬂect this in the instruments we make, the research we
promote, and the discussions we emphasise as valuable.
4. Building counterpowers. Musical instruments are
inherently and deeply political. We should recognise and
engage with these political themes and accept the themes
that belong to musical instruments, by extension, belong
to us as well. We should endeavour to confront and dive
deep into these issues, discuss them broadly, develop ways
to relate to them, and build counterpowers where necessary.
5. Rethinking NIME submissions. If in-depth ex-
plorations of political issues that intersect with new musica l
instrument research are to be included at NIME, we should
reconsider the current format of submission.
First, publishing does not have to only be annually. Re-
views on new commercial instruments, for example, could
be more useful as peer-reviewed online articles published on
a rolling basis rather than only as conference proceedings.
Second, review the page limit for NIME submissions. Sim-
ply excluding references from page limits can encourage
wider scope and more rigorous explorations in the NIME
proceedings. Unpacking and articulating political positions
based on interdisciplinary theory requires space for explo-
ration, and may require several pages for references alone –
and these references often act as way points for other schol-
ars, expanding the community’s discourse as a whole and
introducing new connections with work in other domains.
Third, we should consider what we mean by “novelty” .
The paper review process seems to prioritise technical nov-
elty, leading to an ever-shifting set of ephemeral instru-
ments and discouraging analytical work about existing in-
struments, as well as useful scholarship such as meta re-
views. This review of the term “novelty” could also extend
to the performance review process, as valuing novelty often
results in the over-representation of newly-created instru-
ment made by the performer or their collaborators. Ulti-
mately the pursuit of novelty has environmental and ide-
ological implications, and we should reckon with why we
value new things rather than closely considering that which
we already have.
5. CONCLUSION
“The changes and disruptions that an evolving
technology repeatedly caused in modern life were
accepted as given or inevitable simply because
no one bothered to ask whether there were other
possibilities.” [56]
In this paper we explained why a shift in NIME’s focus
from inward-looking self-reﬂection to more outward-facing,
politically-engaged critique is overdue, and why recent dis-
cussions around accessibility and gender diversity have cre-
ated the space in which this can happen. We argue that
explicit political standpoints on the broad range of political
issues connected to musical instruments is needed, because
not doing so risks implicit agreement with the status quo.
We oﬀered a practical example of developments outside of
NIME, particularly the commercialisation of the democrati-
sation of music-making through instruments launched through
crowdfunding campaigns. While we agree that fostering in-
terest in music is a noble goal, these instruments can reﬂect
techno-solutionism that considers a lack of musical ability
to be a technical problem that requires a technical solution.
This is one of a myriad of latent yet pressing political issues
that intersect with NIME’s musical instrument practice and
research, and propose that these are the kinds of issues that
NIME should be actively developing critical discourse. We
then detail how NIME is in a unique position to oﬀer in-
sight to other domains such as HCI, as this community has
a long history of phenomena such as, for example, taskless
interaction, which HCI has only recently begun to consider.
In this way we can not only enhance our own inquiries, but
ﬁnd ways to make these useful to others. Finally, we suggest
ways through which our community can begin to develop a
robust, outward-facing political perspective.
This work is not intended to impose limitations or bound-
aries within the community, or to discourage the kind of
exploratory, innovative, experimental research that deﬁnes
us. Instead, we suggest that we consider trends and devel-
opments in the outside world in our discussions, research,
critiques and understanding of music technology, along with
the political issues that are connected to the things we make.
Our goal is to raise ontological questions about NIME that
open discussions on who we are and who we want to be. Are
we the developers and keepers of (quasi-)scientiﬁc knowl-
edge? An artist collective advancing an aesthetic agenda?
A guild of craftspeople handing down techniques? An eco-
nomic organisation? And has NIME matured enough to
render political judgements on instrument work outside our
community? Ultimately, we must face the question: how
can we develop political engagement and discourse around
our own work, and can we aﬀord not to do so?
