ABSTRACT
Becoming a practical musician traditionally requires an ex-
tensive amount of preparatory work to master the technical
and theoretical challenges of the particular instrument and
musical style before being able to devote oneself to musi-
cal expression. In particular, in jazz improvisation, one of
the major barriers is the mastery and appropriate selection
of scales from a wide range, according to harmonic context
and style.
In this paper, we present AutoScale, an interactive soft-
ware for making jazz improvisation more accessible by lift-
ing the burden of scale selection from the musician while
still allowing full controllability if desired. This is realized
by implementing a MIDI eﬀect that dynamically maps the
desired scales onto a standardized layout. Scale selection
can be pre-programmed, automated based on algorithmic
lead sheet analysis, or interactively adapted.
We discuss the music-theoretical foundations underlying
our approach, the design choices taken for building an in-
tuitive user interface, and provide implementations as VST
plugin and web applications for use with a Launchpad or
traditional MIDI keyboard.

1. INTRODUCTION
Musical improvisation requires both a thorough understand-
ing of the underlying harmonic structure as well as a high
level of technical expertise to employ this understanding in
actual improvisation. This generally requires many years of
studies with skilled teachers and hundreds and thousands
of hours of laboriously practicing every scale in every key.
This is in particular the case for jazz, where many styles
have a rich repertoire of scales and chord progressions that
frequently contain modulations and substitutions, but it

equally applies to other musical genres, like pop or clas-
sical music. This extensive amount of preparatory work
precludes many non-professionals from following their mu-
sical inspirations and puts a high barrier before fulﬁlling
and gratifying musical expression.
The goal of our work is to lower this burden of theoretical
and technical prerequirements and make jazz improvisation
more accessible to a wider audience. To this end we employ
two principles, partialautomatization and an intuitive user
interface design . In particular, the combination of both
approaches oﬀers new possibilities that go beyond what is
possible with traditional “static” instruments.
The technical diﬃculty of utilizing diﬀerent scales varies
among traditional instruments. On the piano, musicians
have to practice scales as distinct patterns of white and
black keys. Before being able to express herself freely, a
pianist has to master any possible scale, such that her ﬁn-
gers can run intuitively on the keyboard. Alternatively, the
guitar oﬀers some kind of isomorphism, in the sense that
what the musician learns in one key can be reused in other
keys. Unlike the piano, transposing a melody on the guitar
simply means playing the same pattern somewhere else on
the neck. An even better example of an isomorphic instru-
ment is the pedal harp. On the harp, there is one string
per diatonic degree and per octave and alterations of the
scale are set by seven pedals, one for each degree. Once the
pedals are adjusted, the scale is ﬁxed and the musician can
freely play the strings while always remaining in the correct
scale.
The guiding idea behind this work was the following:
What if we had an instrument like the harp, where it is im-
possible to play “out of scale” , but where additionally scale
alterations could be automated to follow a speciﬁc chord pro -
gression? Instead of working with an acoustic harp, we de-
cided to use modern technology, and create a new kind of
MIDI scale mapper. Instead of being static like Ableton’s

Figure 2: Ableton scale plugin mapping the C major
scale onto C natural minor
native MIDI scale mapper (Figure 2), our version promotes
alterations and scale changes and can be automated follow-
ing a chord progression.
We wanted the user interface to be intuitive enough for
anybody to be able to interact with it. Even without any
music theory background, anybody should be able to modify
the proposed scales and explore the harmonic possibilities.
However, the system is adaptable enough to let experienced
musicians use their skills without constraints.
The scale selection is either automated based on a chord
progression or done manually using an interactive chromatic
circle. The former allows the user to play on any jazz tune
without struggling with the question which scale to play in,
while the latter lets them explore and compose freely.
The playing is done using an isomorphic layout, such as
the piano white keys or a pad matrix, where each key (or
pad) is associated with a degree within the scale. The player
cannot, therefore, play out of the scale, but they can change
the scale at will. The system acts as a MIDI eﬀect, or more
precisely as a dynamic MIDI scale mapper.
Our system extends the range of tools for interactive
human-machine improvisation [4, 5, 10] and adds to the
methods for representing musical scales [11, 7, 1, 18].
In the remainder of this paper, we will ﬁrst discuss the
theoretical model used for this project in Section 2 and then
present our user interface in Section 3, including the em-
ployed music-theoretical representation (Section 3.1) and
details on our implementation in two prototype applications
(Section 3.2).
2. MODEL
2.1 Scale Theory
The system presented here is based on three assumptions:
• Octave equivalence
Any scale can be characterized by the notes present in
one octave and every octave contains the same notes.
A note in one octave is equivalent to the corresponding
notes in all other octaves.
• 12 tone equal temperament
The octave is divided into 12 equally distant intervals,
called semitones. The model may be extended later
to diﬀerentiate enharmonic notes, but for clarity sake,
we will stick to the pitch class model [2, p.776] in this
paper.
• 7 degrees nomenclature
In addition to the pitch class, every note is charac-
terized by a degree, which corresponds to the conven-
tional names in music theory (C = 1, D = 2, . . . )
[12, 17]. By default, notes are natural (^, C major
Figure 3: Nonexhaustive list of notes and their no-
tation in degree and semitone
scale), but they can be altered at will ( Z = − 1 semi-
tone, \ = +1 st, ZZ = -2 st, \\\ = +3 st, . . . ) to match
any pitch class.
Given those rules, any note is represented by two integers,
namely the pitch classp ∈ { 0, . . . , 11} and the degree d ∈
{1, . . . , 7}. Figure 3 presents a non-exhaustive list of notes.
To ﬁnd the alteration ( Z, \) of a note N0 given its degree
and pitch class ( d0, p 0) we can therefore compare it to the C
major scale. As the latter contains a note for each degree,
a note with the same degree but possibly diﬀerent pitch
N1 = ( d1 = d0, p 1) exists within the C major scale, and the
alteration of N0 can be calculated as
a0 = ( p0 − p1 + 6) mod 12 − 6 . (1)
This method only works to calculate alterations between − 6
and +5 semitone steps.
Our model is not limited to the diatonic case. Generally,
scales may contain more than one note with the same degree
or even miss a degree. For instance, the C altered scale
is considered to have twice the second degree and no ﬁfth
degree [6, p. 71]: (1, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 6), (6,
8), (7, 10) with notes being represented by (degree, pitch
class), as described above.
One advantage of using this model is the full determina-
tion of intervals between notes. Not only the number of
semitones can be calculated, but also the distance in terms
of degrees. This is advantageous, for instance, for employing
unequal temperament tunings [3] using the MPE protocol
to ﬁne tune each note according to its degree. The interval
betweenN0 = ( d0, p 0) and N1 = ( d1, p 1) is calculated as
follows:
I = (( d1 − d0) mod 7 + 1 , (p1 − p0) mod 12) = ( di, p i) (2)
The names of the intervals are the classical ones [6, p.3].
Figure 4 presents a non-exhaustive list of intervals.
Considering major and perfect as being the natural alter-
ations (= 0, so minor = − 1, augmented = +1, ...), inter-
vallic alterations can be calculated the same way as notes
alterations, by referring to the major scale beginning on the
initial note. Indeed, the major scale only contains major or
perfect intervals. Essentially, interval names are deﬁned in
the same way as notes names, with the only diﬀerence that
intervals are relative while notes are absolute.
For example, the interval between the note C (1, 0) and
EZ (3, 3) is ((3 − 1) mod 7 + 1 , (3 − 0) mod 12) = (3 , 3) which
is a minor third, while between C (1, 0) and D \ (2, 3) is

notation in degree and semitone intervals
Figure 5: Chord types and harmonic functions
((2 − 1) mod 7 + 1 , (3 − 0) mod 12) = (2 , 3), we get an aug-
mented second. It is interesting to note that when looking
at intervals from C, the intervallic alteration is the same as
the note’s alteration. In this case,C → EZ (Z = − 1) is a
minor third (minor = -1), while C → D\ (\ = +1) is an
augmented second (augmented = +1).
The intervallic relations of interest here are those charac-
terizing the distance between the root note and any other
note within the scale. By looking at intervallic alterations
of every note of a heptatonic scale, we can easily compare
it to the major scale. As we said earlier, the latter only
has natural intervallic alterations (major or perfect). Any
intervallic alteration added will highlight the diﬀerence be-
tween the obtained scale and the major one. For example,
the intervallic alterations of mixolydian are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
−1, and we can directly see that this scale can be obtained
by altering down the seventh of the major scale starting on
the same root note.
Given this model, chords and scale are both considered
as subsets of notes. For instance the D minor triad Dm =
(2, 2), (4, 5), (6, 9) has the intervallic alterations 0,− 1, and
0, respectively.
2.2 Chord T ypes
In order to relate scales to chords when parsing a chord pro-
gression, we organize chords into six categories, which we
will call types. Those are presented in Figure 5. They cor-
respond to those used in Schoenberg’sTheory of Harmony
[16].
The middle three columns show which notes are used to
identify the chord/scale type. As we focus on jazz chord
progressions [13, 14], the dominant chords always contain
the minor 7th. A major chord with no 7th is therefore
Figure 6: Scale list for each chord type
Figure 7: Color code for relative degrees
never considered a dominant chord.
The last column presents the possible corresponding chord
functions for each type. As it can be seen, some chord types
correspond to a single chord function (dominant = domi-
nant) while other gather multiple chord functions (major,
minor). In this sense, the chord type is a more general chord
characterization than the chord function.
Based on a given chord type, we can derive a list of match-
ing scales that contain the same core notes. Most of the
scales within a type’s list are highly interchangeable and
the user should be able to switch between them at will.
Figure 6 lists the scales for each chord type.
By default, the chosen scale for each chord type is the
one with an asterisk. In general, the appropriate scale does
not only depend on the chord type but to some extend also
on the harmonic context. This is for instance the case for
the minor chord type, which therefore has two diﬀerent de-
fault scales. The dorian scale is appropriate for the case
where the minor chord is subdominant, while the melodic
minor scale is used on a minor tonic chord. To diﬀerentiate
these two cases, the harmonic context is considered: If the
minor chord is followed by a dominant chord, we analyse
whether it is part of a ii-V progression (or one of the possi-
ble substitution ([6, p.81], [14]): iv-V,Zvi-V, vii-V) or not.
If it is, the minor chord is interpreted as a subdominant
chord and dorian is chosen as the default scale. Otherwise,
if the minor chord is not part of a ii-V progression (or one
of the possible substitutions), it is interpreted as a minor
tonic chord and, therefore, the melodic minor scale is used
as the default scale. This approach can be considered as
ﬁrst heuristic and the model can be improved in the future.

3. USER INTERF ACE
3.1 Representation
3.1.1 Colors
Colors are well suited to draw attention to speciﬁc locations
of the user interface and convey categorical information. A
color code therefore seemed ideal for representing speciﬁc
tonal functions, irrespective of the concrete geometric lay-
out they appear in. The colors used here (Figure 7) are
a suggestion that may be changed according to the user’s
preferences. Central to the color coding scheme is that col-
ors are always determined relative to the current root note,
that is, they represent intervals relative to the root and not
absolute tones. Colors are also used to identify scale de-
grees. The proposed coloring scheme highlights the root,
third, ﬁfth and seventh of any scale, independently of the
alterations (major, minor, perfect, diminished etc.). If other
notes are added (e.g. for octatonic scales), they will be gray.
3.1.2 Alterations
Intervallic alterations are represented by plus and minus
signs (− , +). We chose major and perfect as the “neutral”
alterations and only indicate deviations to keep the repre-
sentation clear. The reason for using mathematical signs as
opposed to music theoretic notation for alterations (Z, ^, \)
was that these are more widely known in a general audience.
The symbols are summarized in Figure 8.
3.1.3 Chromatic Circle
Given our assumptions of octave equivalence and the 12
tone equal temperament, a well-established way to repre-
sent scales is the chromatic circle [9]. Hence for the user
interface, we chose a chromatic circle with the note C on
top and semitones incrementing clockwise. Figure 9 reveals
four scale examples represented using our system.
This representation aims to be as general as possible. In-
deed, any scale that can be played on a piano can be repre-
sented on the chromatic circle. Moreover, our version of the
chromatic circle contains information about degrees and in-
Figure 10: C diminished 1 1⁄ 2 on a guitar
Figure 11: C diminished 1 1⁄ 2 on a piano
tervallic alterations. It can, therefore, be considered as an
enhancement of the standard chromatic circle representa-
tion.
3.1.4 Other Representations
One of the advantages of using colors is that correspondence
can easily be made with other geometrical representations.
Figure 10 shows a scale represented on a guitar and Figure
11 on a piano layout.
These representations are not yet present in our software
at this stage, but they can easily be implemented to show
the correspondence with any type of instrument. This can
also help with learning how to read the chromatic circle.
3.2 Implementation
We implemented our approach in two prototypes, a VST
plugin, and a web-based prototype. The former has been
coded in C++ using the JUCE framework [15], the second
one using the p5.js library [8]. Both consist of the same two
components: a chord progression visualizer and an inter-
active chromatic circle. In the web-based prototype this is
implemented in two separate apps communicating through
MIDI, one for the progression and one for the chromatic cir-
cle. The plugin version is able to parse chord progressions
in the iReal Pro MusicXML format, while the web app uses
simple text ﬁles containing chords in their classic notation
(Am7, C7b9, etc).
3.2.1 Mouse/T ouchsreen
The interactive chromatic circle lets the user obtain and
modify any scale. Starting from a given scale, the user can
alter a degree by simply dragging the corresponding circle
onto a free spot near it. When developing and testing the
interface, this provided the most intuitive way of modifying
scales. When the note is released, its alteration sign is au-
tomatically updated. When moving notes in this way, the
colors remain the same because notes retain their respective
scale degree and only change their alteration. For example,
a third can be altered, but it will remain a third. The user
can, for example, move the third from a major scale down a
semitone (drag itπ/ 6 rad anticlockwise) to obtain a melodic
minor scale.
To only change the fundamental of a scale, that is, to
switch to a diﬀerent mode that uses the same notes but has

425
Figure 12: Relative degrees of new notes according
to their relative pitch classes
a diﬀerent fundamental (e.g. from major to dorian, phrygian
etc.), the user can click or tap on a non-fundamental note.
This is a great way to discover which are the intervallic
alterations of all modes from a scale.
New notes can be added by clicking or tapping on a free
spot and deleted by dragging them out of the circle. When
adding a note, its degree is deﬁned by the following rules:
• If the neighboring notes have a distance of two in
terms of their degree, the new note takes the degree
in between.
• For all cases, the degree is deﬁned by the relation
shown in Figure 12 with the pitch class being com-
puted relative to the root note of the current scale.
The degree in this table (dr) is also relative to the
root’s degree ( df ), which means that the absolute de-
gree (C, D, ...) is found using the following formula:
d = (( df + dr − 2) mod 7) + 1 . (3)
The option to add and delete notes is currently only avail-
able in the plugin version, while the web-based prototype is
limited to heptatonic scales.
3.2.2 Piano Keyboard
When using heptatonic scales, a MIDI piano keyboard can
be conveniently used to play within those scales. The sys-
tem then acts as a standard MIDI scale mapper and the
white keys are associated with corresponding degrees of the
scale. Our app, therefore, has a MIDI input and a MIDI
output, where the input only accepts natural notes (white
keys), while the output corresponds to the selected scale.
If a key is held during an alteration process (note on sent
but not note oﬀ), the pitch class is remembered by the soft-
ware in order to send the correct note oﬀ message when the
key is released.
This system works well for most cases, but is still limited
as octatonic scales cannot be intuitively mapped on the pi-
ano keyboard. An alternative solution is discussed in the
next section.
3.2.3 RGB P ad Matrix
Pad matrices, such as the Launchpad Pro, the ROLI Light-
pad or the Native Instrument Maschine, oﬀer a better lay-
out as they are not restricted to seven degrees and mostly
have RGB capabilities. Therefore, a stronger relation can
be made between the instrument and the scale representa-
tion.
Since the interval between rows can be deﬁned arbitrarily
we tested diﬀerent layouts. For guitarists, an interval of a
fourth between the rows corresponds best to what they are
used to, while for violinists a ﬁfth is more intuitive. For this
Figure 13: Launchpad layout of three scales, with a
ﬁfth between rows
reason, we did not ﬁx a speciﬁc interval but this parameter
can be user-deﬁned. An example of the layout of three
diﬀerent scales is shown in Figure 13. Note that any diatonic
scale with C as its root is represented by the same layout as
C major (Figure 13, ﬁrst layout). This is because only the
degrees are shown but not the corresponding alterations.
One of the great advantages of using an isomorphic in-
strument is that all the techniques and reﬂexes learned in
one scale can be applied in any other scale and in any key.
Furthermore, when using only heptatonic scales (as in the
web app prototype), distances between the pads are always
related to the interval in terms of degrees only. This allows
musicians to focus more on the development of melodic skills
and allows their application in a wide range of harmonic sit-
uations.
Our prototypes have been tested using the Launchpad
Pro. As the web app is restricted to heptatonic scales, it
can be used both with a Launchpad Pro and with a standard
MIDI piano controller.
3.2.4 Progression
Chords are parsed by converting them into arrays of notes.
Their type is then determined using the rules presented in
Figure 5. Based on the type, a group of scales is associated
to each chord, as shown in Figure 6. The user may pre-
select a scale from the list by using the up/down arrow
keys. Chords may either be selected manually by using the
left/right arrow keys or be automatically advanced by using
a MIDI clock signal. This allows to use chord progression
when recording over DAW tracks or in conjunction with
hardware MIDI clock sources like sequencers.
In the web based prototype, which consists of two sep-
arate applications (progression and chromatic circle, see
above), the scale information is sent over MIDI using a vir-
tual MIDI cable. In this way, only the progression app
needs to analyze the chords, determines the type, and hold
the scale list. When a new chord is selected or the user
changes the scale, the scale information is sent to the chro-
matic circle app in order to update the display according to
the new scale.
To gain a better intuition we discuss a brief example. We
will use a simple progression of four chords: Cmaj7, A7,
Dm7, G7. For the ﬁrst chord, the user keeps the default
scale, C ionian. On the second chord, they change the de-
fault A mixolydian to A mixolydianZ9 Z13. The third chord
is played using the D dorian Z9 scale, and on the last chord
the much more dissonant G altered dominant scale is cho-
sen. Figure 14 shows the state of the progression (top), the
chromatic circle (middle) and the Launchpad (bottom) for
each chord in the progression (left to right).
4. CONCLUSION
We have presented a new kind of responsive scale repre-
sentation that facilitates improvisation over complex chord

progressions. This achieved by mapping scales to a uni-
ﬁed layout, such that the musician can focus on musical
expression and is relieved from the burden of choosing an
appropriate scale. Our system is implemented as a dynamic
MIDI scale mapper that allows to automatically select an
appropriate scale based on a given chord progression. Scales
may be manually pre-selected or altered as desired and scale
changes may either be performed manually or automatically
based on MIDI clock signals. The user interface is based
on a comprehensive music-theoretic representation, which
is accessible to a wide audience and does not require in-
tense musical training.
We are planning to extend the system by adding more
customization features (e.g. user-seleced color schemes), rep -
resentations of other instrumental layouts (e.g. for guitar),
and advanced harmonic analyses that allow for more sophis-
ticated scale selection techniques, using machine learningon
transcriptions from professional jazz musicians.
Furthermore, our system will also have to be more thor-
oughly evaluated by presenting it to both trained jazz mu-
sicians and as well as beginners. We hope that it will be of
great pedagogical value by providing an alternative way to
represent music.
