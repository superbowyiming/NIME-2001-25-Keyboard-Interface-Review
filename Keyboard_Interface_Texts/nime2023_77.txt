ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present the Hapstrument: 1 a bimanual
haptic interface for musical expression. This DMI uses two
low-cost 2-DoF haptic force-feedback devices, one for each
hand. The left device controls pitch selection, while the
right device controls excitation by simulating the feeling
of bowing or plucking a string. A user study was run to
evaluate the effectiveness of the Hapstrument. This eval-
uation received a wide range of reviews, from excellent to
poor. Ultimately, the musical backgrounds of the partic-
ipants greatly impacted their experiences with the Hap-
strument. For participants whose expectations aligned with
what the instrument could provide, it was an effective DMI
that uses force feedback to enhance musical expression.

1. INTRODUCTION
Digital musical instruments (DMIs) have given musicians
many alternative methods for musical expression. However,
the majority of them are expensive and inaccessible to the
general public. In accordance with the theme of NIME 2023,
“Frugal Music Innovation”, we see an opportunity to use the
Haply 2diy [12], an inexpensive DIY pantograph-inspired

device, to create a new DMI capable of musical expression.
The Haply 2diy contains easily-replaceable 3D-printed me-
chanical parts and uses open-sourced firmware, making it
an ideal tool to create a simple, low-cost, and lightweight
DMI.
We are interested specifically in implementing haptic feed-
back for our novel DMI. Haptic feedback is an important
aspect of musical instruments and can greatly improve the
affective and expressive experiences of a musician [13]. In
the past, the haptic feedback of instruments was closely tied
to the physical structure needed to produce a specific sound.
However, modern DMIs often lack force feedback because
the acoustic properties of the instrument are replaced with
digital alternatives. The Haply 2diy is capable of providing
haptic force feedback which we can leverage to enhance the
musical expression that a musician can produce during a
performance.
The contribution of this paper is the exploration of whether
low-cost 2-DoF force-feedback devices may be used to model
bowing and plucking with a continuous transition between
the two. This technique was developed within the context
of a DMI that supports other requisite functionality such
as pitch selection. We also explored to what degree this
interaction paradigm can contribute to musical expression.
To address these questions, we conducted a user study with
musicians, working with the novel bimanual haptic interface
we developed for this purpose.
2. RELATED WORK
The relevant literature to this project is mainly from the
NIME community and consists of force feedback in DMIs.
A force-feedback musical system used a brake-augmented
ball pen stylus on a sticky touch-sensitive surface [8]; an
enhanced handle for a Phantom Omni combined vibrotactile
feedback with force feedback to simulate bowing [5]; and a
1-DoF force-feedback device used various haptic illusions,
such as a slope or clutch illusion, to simulate various terrains
and map them to audio parameters [11].
Sheffield et al. used two rotational force-feedback knobs
to convey physical models for various musical applications
[9]. One of the inspiring applications provided in this paper
was the use of knobs to simulate plucking harp strings.
Howard et al. created a music synthesis system that al-
lows virtual instruments to be controlled by a force-feedback
joystick and force-feedback mouse [7]. Inspiring our own
design, the authors used force feedback to simulate various
excitation methods, such as plucking and bowing a string.
Steiner created a DMI by using a haptic joystick and hap-
tic mouse [10]. The joystick was used to select the timbre
and the mouse was used to select the pitch and amplitude.
Haptic feedback assisted with note and timbre selection.
Berdahl and Kontogeorgakopoulos created the FireFader [3],
a 1-DoF force feedback device that has been used in several
projects in the NIME community [2, 4, 1].
3. DESIGN
Inspired by the aforementioned literature, we decided to
set one Haply 2diy to control the pitch of the instrument,
and the other 2diy to control volume and timbre through
physical models that use force feedback to simulate plucking
and bowing.
We chose pitch to be controlled by the left-hand 2diy and
excitation to be controlled by the right-hand 2diy because
this division of tasks is the standard configuration for most
stringed instruments, such as violin and guitar.
As illustrated in Figure 1, the end effector positions of
the two Haply 2diy devices are passed from the Haply hAPI
library to Processing through serial communication, and
force feedback is calculated and delivered. Processing gen-
erates visuals for both devices, which are presented through
a graphical user interface (GUI). Sound control commands
from Processing are passed to Pure Data as Open Sound
Control (OSC) messages, and external speakers play the
synthesized output.

3.1 Pitch Selection Interface
The purpose of the pitch selection interface is to provide
musicians with an easy way of selecting a pitch/frequency
for the synthesized sound. Through an iterative design pro-
cess, a number of pitch selection interfaces were created and
tested.
The first design employed a piano layout, as illustrated in
Figure 2. Unlike the quantization of a conventional piano to
discrete notes, pitch could also be modified continuously by
moving the end effector horizontally below the representa-
tion of the keyboard. This was inspired by the Haken Con-
tinuum [6], which supports continuous pitch selection using
a keyboard-like interface. While moving the end effector
above the piano, pitch remained constant, thus permitting
the musician to transition between non-adjacent notes. The
ability to have both discrete and continuous notes provided
the musician with multiple ways of expressing themselves.
Finally, with this design, the Haply 2diy generated a hap-
tic “bump” when moving over a line, giving musicians force
feedback to help them move from note to note.
We tested this design and discovered some significant lim-
itations. Most notably, it was very difficult to quickly move

from a note to any note not directly beside it. A piano inter-
face ultimately has its design because, from an ergonomic
perspective, it fits the affordances of human hands very well.
For a single end effector, a keyboard representation is not
the ideal interface. As a result, we replaced the piano inter-
face with a 2-octave circular layout, as shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Two-octave circular layout used for pitch selection.
This layout made it much easier to move between different
notes, with the pitch remaining constant inside the circle,
and continuous pitch selection occurring outside the circle.
Furthermore, a feature was implemented which allowed a
specific key and scale to be selected so that only the rele-
vant notes would be available to play. Similar to the piano
design, all of the lines in this interface provided force feed-
back as “bumps”, so that users could tell when they moved
from one note to another.
This layout was refined and a few more features were
introduced, resulting in our most recent design, shown in
Figure 4. Three columns were added to the interface. Mov-
ing the end effector over column 1 selects the desired key,
while doing so over column 2 selects the scale.
Column 3 shows the saved key-scale combinations. A
user can move the end effector over one of these segments
to select it, and then any change to the key or scale will
be saved there. This allows a user to easily switch between
three key-scale combinations, without needing to manually
select the key and scale each time.
The ability to implement vibrato was added to the pitch
selection interface. When the end effector is inside one of
the discrete ring segments, the user can shake it back and
forth, and the amplitude and frequency of the movement
will map to the properties of the vibrato.

to each of the columns.
3.2 Excitation Interface
While the left Haply 2diy focuses on pitch selection, the
right 2diy focuses on note excitation. For this purpose, two
approaches were selected: the simulation of a pluck, such
as when playing a guitar, and the sensation of moving a
bow across a string instrument such as a violin or cello.
For the plucking simulation, a vertical line was drawn to
represent a string, and the haptic response was modelled
as extending a spring. However, past a threshold distance
away from the center of the string, the force will be removed
suddenly, and the user can feel the plucking effect. This
was made more realistic by adding a subtle vibration at the
moment after the pluck, to simulate the resonance of an
acoustic instrument. In the GUI of the plucking model, a
representation of the string bends and vibrates to imitate
the characteristics of a real acoustic string as it is plucked.
For the bowing approach, we note that users playing a
real violin or cello experience a resistive force, dependent
on how hard the bow is being pressed against the string.
Unfortunately, the Haply 2diy does not have a sensor to de-
tect how hard the handle is being pressed against its surface.
However, among stringed instruments, there is often a cor-
relation between the speed of the bow and its force against
the string. Therefore, we chose to calculate the resistive
force as proportional to the speed of the end effector.
To produce the rough haptic sensations that are ordinar-
ily associated with bowing, we introduced small, random
variations in the force feedback to the Haply 2diy. Finally,
to prevent the force from changing too quickly and being
too volatile, we set the force to be a weighted sum of the
current and previous values. By adjusting the weights, we
found a mix that produces a believable and enjoyable bow-
ing model.
Based on encouraging initial feedback from the members
of the research team, we incorporated both models into the
Hapstrument, with the top half of the Haply 2diy workspace
being used for plucking and the bottom half for bowing.
As the end effector moves between the zones, there is a
smooth interpolation between these models for haptic feed-
back, GUI display, and sound output.
At first, a linear interpolation was used; however, it was
difficult to only pluck or bow because unless the end effector
was at the very top or bottom, it would be a combination
of the two. To address this issue, a sigmoid interpolation
was chosen, which yielded better results.
The volume of the synthesized sound in Pure Data was
set to be proportional to the velocity of the end effector
while bowing or at the moment of plucking, similar to the
resistive force mentioned earlier. We set the default timbre
of the instrument to be a synthesized sine wave. If the vol-
ume reaches above a certain threshold, a sawtooth wave is
gradually introduced to add spectral content at higher fre-
quencies. This provides more opportunities for expressivity
while still focusing on the haptic interface.
4. EV ALUATION
To determine how successful the Hapstrument is among mu-
sicians, we chose to evaluate it through a user study.
4.1 Procedure and Recruitment
We conducted our user study among members of the Centre
for Interdisciplinary Research in Music, Media and Technol-
ogy (CIRMMT) community at McGill University. Eleven
people were recruited for evaluating the Hapstrument (5F,
6M, ages 22 to 36, average 28.4). These participants had a
range of musical backgrounds. Some had no formal train-
ing, some grew up playing regularly, and some had a degree
in music.
Before the test, participants were given an introductory
survey, asking them about their musical skill, their exposure
to DMIs, and their experience with haptic force-feedback
devices.
During the test, participants were introduced to the Hap-
strument and given a brief explanation of its functionality.
They were then given time to explore the instrument and try
it out. Following this, they were asked to complete several
tasks, such as playing a scale, plucking, bowing, and tran-
sitioning between the two. Next, participants were given
15–20 minutes to play with the Hapstrument and prepare a
performance for the end of the session, in which they would
play a composition with musical expression. This was de-
fined to them as the ability to invoke an emotional response
or bring the music to life.
Participants played their composition and completed a
post-test questionnaire, consisting of questions about what
they liked and disliked, as well as eight Likert scale questions
regarding the following aspects of their experience:
• Pitch selection interface
• Feeling of plucking
• Feeling of bowing
• Plucking/bowing interface
• Overall experience with the Hapstrument
• Ability to express yourself
• Impact of haptic feedback on expressing yourself
• Impact of mixing plucking and bowing on expressing
yourself
4.2 Results and Discussion
The pitch selection interface received mediocre reviews over-
all, having an average value of 3.3 when rated from 1 to 5.
The idea of using a scale/key system to select distinct tones
was described by a participant as “Eurocentric”. Some par-
ticipants liked this system and said that it made it easy to
play a piece in the chosen key. However, other participants
described it as very limiting for them.
When a scale is selected, some of the segments may be
larger than others due to the distances between notes in
a scale, as seen in Figure 4. Some participants liked this,
saying that it is good for visualizing music scales. However,
the smaller segments were often harder to select, and many
participants had difficulty with this.
The haptic feedback of this interface, which consisted of
“bumps” when moving over lines, had generally good re-
views. Most participants liked it, saying that it improved
spatial awareness. However, other participants reported
that the additional force required made navigating the in-
terface more cumbersome. Other positive aspects of the
pitch selection interface included the ability to add vibrato
and the presence of the continuous zone outside of the ring.
The excitation interface had slighter higher reviews, re-
ceiving an average value of 3.7. People generally enjoyed
plucking but had a range of preferences for the strength of
the haptic resistance, which some described as unrealistic.
Some participants enjoyed the vibrational force delivered af-
ter plucking but others found it distracting and “mushy”. A
few participants suggested that it would be nice to be able
to “lift up” the Haply 2diy handle so that you could move it
across the string without plucking, although the 2diy lacks
that ability.
Participants generally enjoyed bowing more than pluck-
ing. The haptic resistance made it feel lifelike, which helped
users to musically express themselves. However, some of
them disliked the roughness of the bowing and preferred for
the force to simply be resistive.
The ability to switch between plucking and bowing was
one of the novelties of the Hapstrument, and 8 of the 11
participants enjoyed this feature. However, one user disliked
it because “it can’t be done on a real instrument”, while
others found it too difficult to use while focusing on the
pitch selection interface.
The Haply 2diy itself had a number of issues throughout
the evaluation process. The magnetic handle would some-
times fall off, and some participants disliked its ergonomics
and said that their wrists felt sore. Furthermore, the 2diy
itself generated a minor rattling sound when the end effector
moved across the surface, which some participants found to
be distracting and irritating. Fortunately, the newest ver-
sion of the 2diy eliminates the rattling issue.
Overall, the results of the post-test questionnaires exhib-
ited significant variation across participants, with average
ratings almost uniformly spread between 2 and 5 out of
a maximum of 5, as shown in Figure 5. Some gave the
Hapstrument high ratings across the board, indicative of
promise for future development, while others consistently
rated it poorly, suggesting that from their perspective, the
instrument suffered insurmountable issues.

Although we did not observe a correlation between the
musical education of our participants and their post-test
questionnaire results, the type of music they played was
largely predictive of their enjoyment of the Hapstrument:
those who focused on atonal composition and experimental
music disliked the Hapstrument and gave an average rating
of 2.5, while those who played classical music appreciated
its pitch selection interface, which matched their musical
expectations, and they gave an average rating of 3.8.
Similarly, participants with prior exposure to haptic de-
vices favourably viewed the haptic sensations from bowing
and plucking, whereas those who had never used such de-
vices often found the force feedback distracting.
The main limitation of this user study was the small par-
ticipant population. Future studies with larger groups may
reveal additional insights into the effectiveness of the Hap-
strument.
5. CONCLUSION
Returning to the theme of NIME 2023, frugal music inno-
vation requires resources that are affordable and available.
The Haply 2diy is an effective tool for this theme, due to its
easily replaceable 3D-printed mechanical parts and its low
cost ( ∼USD 500) in comparison with other commercially
available force-feedback devices, which usually cost many
thousands of dollars. Basic motors can be cheaper than the
2diy and can also add haptic effects to DMIs. However,
they lack some of the main features of the 2diy, such as
its pantograph-inspired structure, convenient API, and its
ability to produce force feedback in any 2D direction.
Our main research goal in this study was to explore whether
low-cost 2-DoF force-feedback devices can model bowing
and plucking with a continuous transition between the two,
and if so, to what degree this can contribute to musical
expression. We were able to create the desired interaction
paradigm and based on the evaluation we conducted, some
people found it effective and realistic, although others had
different preferences. Regarding musical expression, for sev-
eral participants, the Haply 2diy was certainly capable of
enabling them to express themselves effectively. However,
the negative reviews from different participants would indi-
cate otherwise.
Ultimately, the evaluation of the Hapstrument demon-
strates that the preferences people have towards new digi-
tal musical instruments will heavily depend on their back-
grounds and the expectations that they bring into their ex-
periences with the instrument. For the participants whose
expectations matched what the Hapstrument could offer,
it was an expressive and effective low-cost DMI. One par-
ticipant even described it as the “most successful software
instrument I’ve seen coming out of CIRMMT for the last
4 years”. However, for the participants who had different
expectations, this DMI was not the right choice for them.
Future improvements to the Hapstrument, as recommended
by our study participants, may include adding a button to
the device’s handle as an additional input, implementing
more timbre parameters, and introducing new visual fea-
tures to the GUI.
