ABSTRACT
This paper presents the KeyWI, an electronic wind instru-
ment based on the melodica that improves upon limitations
in current systems and is general and powerful enough to
support a variety of applications. Four opportunities for
growth are identiﬁed in current electronic wind instrument
systems, which then are used to focus the development and
evaluation of the instrument. The KeyWI features a breath
pressure sensor with a large dynamic range, a keyboard that
allows for polyphonic pitch selection, and a completely in-
tegrated construction. Sound synthesis is performed with
Faustcode compiled to the Bela Mini, which oﬀers low-
latency audio and a simple yet powerful development work-
ﬂow. In order to be as accessible and versatile as possible,
the hardware and software is entirely open-source, and fab-
rication requires only common maker tools.

1. INTRODUCTION
Wind instruments are favored for their ability to create
a uniquely intimate connection between musician and in-
strument, transforming the fundamental human gesture of
breath into a form of creative expression. Their ability to
capture nuances in a musician’s playing is essential to their
versatility and expressiveness.
However, electronic wind instruments have not always
been able to match the capabilities and characteristics crit-
ical to acoustic wind instruments. Diﬃculties include re-
strictions in control that limit the musician’s command of
an instrument, and restrictions in sound that limit a mu-
sician’s range of expression. The goal of the KeyWI is to
create an intuitive and powerful electronic wind instrument
that eliminates these obstacles; additionally, it aims to be as
open-source and reproducible as possible, such that it can

be used as a platform for development and be replicated by
anyone with access to suﬃcient tools.

Bela Mini, custom PCB, enclosure, and sensors
The KeyWI’s design is based on the melodica, a handheld
wind instrument where pitches are selected using a piano-
style keyboard and dynamics are controlled by blowing into
a mouthpiece attached to the side of the instrument.
The use of a keyboard as a pitch controller rather than the
more common woodwind-key-inspired designs aims to be
accessible to users who may not have prior experience with
the specialized ﬁngerings required for wind instruments, as
well as oﬀering intuitive polyphonic capabilities.
2. HISTORY AND RELA TED WORK
Due to acoustic wind instruments’ enduring popularity, there
is a long history of electronic wind instruments, which have
constantly been inﬂuenced by the technological capabilities
and ideas of their times.
In 1936, inventor Benjamin Miessner ﬁled a patent [7] for
an “Apparatus for the production of music” that used an
electromagnetic pickup placed in a clarinet reed to sense
vibrations; however, there is no record of a functional in-
strument ever being produced. Later, a 1941 patent for an
“Electric clarinet” [1] featured a simple on/oﬀ sensor to de-
tect breath pressure. Yet, it was not until 1967 that the ﬁrst
electronic instrument to contain a breath pressure sensor,
the Hohner Electra-Melodica, was produced commercially.
Little dynamic range and limited choice in timbre, however,
resulted in low sales. In the 1970s, the ﬁrst widely adopted
wind controllers, the Lyricon controllers [10], began pro-
duction. The sturdier and more sensitive breath pressure
sensor and similarity in construction and control to acous-
tic wind instruments led to its rise in adoption among wind
instrument players. The Lyricon outputted control voltage
that could be used as the input for an analog synthesizer,
oﬀering a wider range of possible sounds. The populariza-

tion of MIDI in the 1980s led to the advent of MIDI wind
controllers, including the Yamaha WX (roughly based upon
of the design of the Lyricon controllers) and Akai EWI lines
of breath controllers. These controllers featured higher-
resolution breath sensors and could be used with MIDI
synthesizers and interfaces. For many years, Yamaha also
manufactured breath sensors such as the BC3 that could
be used with keyboard synthesizers such as the DX7. To-
day, the WX and EWI lines of wind controllers continue to
be the most prominent commercial breath controllers—they
are similar in design and control to a clarinet or saxophone
and can be used to control hardware or software synths.
There are also many non-commercial wind instruments
and controllers. The Electronic Valve Instrument (EVI)
[13], invented by Nyle Steiner in 1975, is an early electronic
wind controller based on the trumpet’s valve system. It was
later adapted into the Akai EWI mentioned above. Con-
trollers since have featured improvements and explorations
in control systems, sensors, application, and construction [2,
3, 4]. The NIME community has also developed numerous
electronic wind instruments and controllers. Gary Scavone’s
Pipe [12] is a general MIDI wind controller that contains a
variety of sensors in a compact format. The Epipe [5] is
a wind controller designed after open tonehole instruments
that is capable of detecting the nuances in pitch control
oﬀered by such instruments.
Generally, electronic wind instruments have developed in
two ways: 1. more accurate, capable, diverse, and reli-
able sensors and control systems; and 2. greater freedom in
sound and application. However, modern instruments still
tend to suﬀer from some of the same issues as previous elec-
tronic wind instruments, including including restricted dy-
namic range, transient detection, limitations in sound pro-
duction, and capacity for control by non-wind instrument
players.
The development of the KeyWI focuses on creating a wind
instrument that reduces limitations in control and that is
accessible and versatile enough to be used as a platform for
development.
3. ANAL YSIS OF CURRENT SYSTEMS
We compared recordings of an acoustic melodica and var-
ious modeled counterparts in order to identify the most
salient limitations in current technology. A sampling of
various electronic wind instrument and breath controller
systems were tested (including a variety of control systems
and both sample-based and physically modeled systems).
The modeled instrument samples below were generated us-
ing a Yamaha VL70-m physical modeling synthesizer with
a BC3 breath controller, and were largely representative of
the ﬁndings. Four limitations in the modeled systems com-
pared to the acoustic instrument were identiﬁed.
3.1 Attacks/T ransients
Figure 2 compares the spectrograms of representative exam-
ples of acoustic and modeled melodica attacks. All samples
were recorded with the same user trying to create as fast of
an attack as possible, but note the diﬀerence in the attack
times (time for all overtones to reach within 5 dB of steady
state):≈ 50 ms for the model versus ≈ 35 ms for acous-
tic. While attack times did vary between instruments, they
all had attacks signiﬁcantly longer than that of an acoustic
melodica.
3.2 Dynamic Range
To test dynamic range, the electronic systems and the melod-
ica were played at ﬁve intensities of breath, ranging from as
soft as possible to very hard. The limited dynamic ranges of
Figure 2: Spectrograms of the attacks of acoustic
(right) and modeled (left) melodica, both played
with as fast attacks as possible
the electronic systems were clear: at low breath pressures,
the output ﬂuctuated erratically with clearly audible “steps”
in the intensity of the signal, or simply did not register.
At the two highest breath pressures, there was almost no
variation in the signal at all. While breath controllers and
sensors do feature variations of “gain” and “oﬀset” controls,
even with the gain (i.e., dynamic range) at its maximum,
the dynamic range is small: the user either needs to blow
very hard to make any sound, or the sensor quickly maxes
out.
Unlike the electronic system, the melodica’s output varies
signiﬁcantly at every level of breath pressure. Judging by
these qualitative tests, the acoustic melodica has signiﬁ-
cantly more dynamic range than the electronic system.
3.3 V ariance and Expressiveness
The timbre of an acoustic melodica is so responsive to breath
pressure that the amplitudes of the overtones of an acoustic
melodica ﬂuctuate over time, even as a player attempts to
maintain a constant level of breath pressure. This variation
is a result of small inconsistencies in breath pressure being
reﬂected in the ﬁnal result. In comparison, the overtones
of the modeled systems are almost completely static. This
responsiveness to varying breath pressures also determines
the degree to which a user is able to intentionally shape the
timbre of an instrument.
3.4 Pitch Control Interfaces
Many electronic breath controllers, such as the Akai EWI
and Yamaha WX, feature pitch control systems based on
acoustic wind instruments such as clarinets or saxophones.
However, these methods of control are tailored speciﬁcally
to wind instrument players, and cannot support polyphony
in any practical way.
4. THE INSTRUMENT
We developed the KeyWI guided by several overall objec-
tives: 1. improving upon the limitations just discussed;
2. being accessible to as many users as possible; 3. open
source hardware and software; and 4. modular/adaptable
such that it can be used in a variety of applications.
The Bela Mini processing board [6] synthesizes the sound
with high performance and low latency. The language cho-
sen to implement the synthesis isFaust (Functional Au-
dio Stream)[11], 1 a language that targets high-performance
real-time digital signal processing. Faust on Bela oﬀers 1.6
ms latency (with default buﬀer sizes), and Faust’s block-
diagram driven structure and performance make the lan-
guage a logical choice for an accessible development plat-
form. Additionally, it has an extensive collection of libraries

that include implementations of numerous oscillators, ﬁl-
ters, envelope generators, and eﬀects, as well as physical
models of several wind instruments. TheFaust compiler
can build directly to C++ Bela programs, which creates a
very simple workﬂow.
Figure 3: Block diagram of the KeyWI setup
The control system is comprised of two main components:
a MIDI keyboard and a breath pressure sensor. The MIDI
keyboard used is a MIDIPLUS AKM320,2 which can be
purchased online for $35 USD. Only the keys, key contacts,
and main circuit board from the controller are used; custom
3D-printed hardware replaces the casing, mounts, and other
electronics. The keyboard sends key and velocity data to
the main board via USB MIDI. An MPXV4006DP,3 a mi-
cromachined pressure sensor, measures breath input from 0
to 0.87 psi with 2.5% accuracy. The sensor is mounted to
a Modern Device MPXV breakout board,4 which in turn
mounts to the PCB through a removable header. One pres-
sure input of the sensor is left unconnected and the other is
joined to a short vinyl tube that extends just outside of the
casing. A 3D-printed mouthpiece connects either directly to
this tube, such that the KeyWI is brought up to the mouth
to be played, or to a longer vinyl tube, so that it can be
rested on a table. A small hole in the side of the mouth-
piece allows air to ﬂow through the mouthpiece without
compromising the breath pressure measurement. This hole
also results in an augmented dynamic range: proportion-
ally less pressure is exerted on the sensor as the user blows
harder, so it takes signiﬁcantly more pressure to reach the
sensor’s limit. Furthermore, the sensor is capable of sensing
both positive and negative pressure diﬀerentials, so diﬀerent
behaviors could be mapped to the “draws” and the “blows,”
allowing for the possibility of harmonica-like controls.
Figure 4: PCB mounted to the Bela Mini cape
A custom-printed circuit board serves as the central hub
for all connections going in and out of the Bela Mini. It
mounts to the top of the Bela cape through headers soldered
to the board, some of which function as electrical connec-
tions to the Bela as well as structural support. The pres-
sure sensor, output jack, and other components all mount
to the PCB. The two potentiometers connect directly to the

Bela, where they control oﬀset (pressure required to make
a sound) and sensitivity (pressure needed to reach maxi-
mum), while an LED provides visual feedback when breath
input is detected. The entire setup is powered by batter-
ies located in the right side of the KeyWI. The enclosure
is comprised of nine laser-cut layers of birch plywood fas-
tened together with four bolts, and the keyboard supports
and main circuit board mount to the bottom layer of the
enclosure.
To be as accessible to as many users as possible, the
KeyWI is entirely open source: project ﬁles, 5 Bela software
and hardware, and the Faust compiler are all open source.
It can be assembled with only access to basic maker tools,
common supplies, and Internet.
5. RESUL TS
We evaluate the KeyWI in comparison to an acoustic melod-
ica, according to the four limitations of previous breath con-
troller systems identiﬁed in Section 2.
5.1 Attacks/T ransients
Figure 5: Spectrogram of KeyWI melodica attack
The MPX breath pressure sensor exhibits very good re-
sponse to quick changes in pressure. As seen in Figure 5—
captured using a sharp, “tongued” start to each note—the
initial attack of the KeyWI melodica (about 25 ms) is much
shorter than that of the modeled system tested in Section
3 (about 50 ms).
5.2 Dynamic Range
The test of ﬁve varying breath pressures executed in Sec-
tion 3.2 was also conducted with the KeyWI melodica. The
KeyWI melodica clearly exhibited responsiveness to each
level of breath pressure—with the sensor output scaled be-
tween -1 and 1 (0 = no pressure, positive values = blowing,
negative values = sucking), the pressure sensor returned
values of 0.14 at the softest level of blowing and blowing as
hard as possible returned a value of 0.91. The sensor also re-
sponded smoothly to low pressures, not exhibiting the step-
ping and unpredictable behavior of other tested systems.
Whereas some electronic wind instrument systems are lim-
ited by their smaller dynamic range, the KeyWI’s extended
capabilities oﬀer a greater freedom of expression to a user.
5.3 V ariance/Expressiveness
Figure 6 displays KeyWI melodica notes for a synthesized
input (60% pressure with 20% amplitude modulation via
a 2 Hz sine wave), and with a user attempting to main-
tain a constant level of pressure. Note how the synthesized
modulation results in the modulation of the amplitudes of
overtones and the overall signal. With the human input,

Figure 6: Spectrograms of KeyWI note with syn-
thesized (left) and user (right) pressure input
the sensitivity of the pressure sensor results in natural vari-
ance in the pressure input, which is then reﬂected in a sim-
ilar manner in the resulting audio (note the variance in the
higher overtones and a slight dip in overall volume at about
2.5s). Some electronic systems attempt to add variance by
introducing randomness to the sound synthesis algorithm.
While this approach may be eﬀective on some level, it de-
creases the musician’s level of control over the instrument,
and does not solve the underlying problem: the lack of sen-
sitivity and precise control over the intricacies of the in-
strument. Since this type of precise control is what attracts
many players to wind instruments, it seems counterproduc-
tive to mimic this expressiveness rather than giving control
to the user themselves.
5.4 Pitch Control Interfaces
A piano keyboard was chosen as the basis of the control
system due to its versatility and universality as a pitch con-
troller. Using a keyboard rather than a design similar to
a wind instrument allows for intuitive polyphonic control.
Additionally, it makes the KeyWI accessible to a wider au-
dience, as the number of keyboard players worldwide sig-
niﬁcantly outnumbers the number of woodwind players (in
2018, 1.4 million acoustic and electric pianos and keyboard
systems were sold in the US compared to 350 thousand wind
instruments [9]). This large community of keyboard players
creates a “pluggable community” (as explained by Morreale
et al. [8]), from which users can transfer their existing skill
set of playing a keyboard to the KeyWI.
5.5 Development W orkﬂow
Also central to the design of the KeyWI as a platform is
its workﬂow and ease of development. TheFaust compiler
can build directly to a Bela C++ architecture, and the re-
sulting ﬁle is simply imported onto the Bela Mini. Using
the onlineFaust editor6 and browser-based Bela IDE, this
entire process can be executed in less than a minute, us-
ing exclusively GUI-based systems, without any setup or
installations. This creates an accessible and eﬃcient work-
ﬂow that also allows for quick iteration of ideas.
The sound synthesis for the KeyWI melodica is based on
the symmetrical clipping of a sine wave in order to create
the odd harmonics characteristic of the vibration of free
reeds in a melodica. When a multiple of the un-clipped sine
wave is subtracted from the clipped signal in order to par-
tially remove the fundamental frequency, the result closely
models the sound produced by a melodica. The severity of
the clipping varies directly with breath pressure to appro-
priately model the change in timbre caused by changes in
breath pressure. Using this synthesis algorithm, the entire
program (including data collection, melodica tone synthe-
sis, transient envelope generation, breath noise synthesis,
and mixing) requires just 25 lines ofFaust code.

6. CONCLUSION
The KeyWI aims to improve upon several limitations in
current systems and provide an accessible platform for more
expressive, realistic, and musical instruments. It combines
the power and versatility ofFaust and the Bela Mini, a
control system based on a piano keyboard rather than a
wind instrument, and a custom PCB and enclosure for a
fully integrated, digitally manufactured design.
Though a wind instrument, the KeyWI can be used as a
development platform for a wide variety of digital musical
instruments; the PCB provides a simpliﬁed interface for the
Bela Mini that includes USB pins, audio out, various inputs
including a breath sensor, and an external power button.
There are several possible additions that could expand its
capabilities. Adding a microphone would allow for an even
greater range of expression, including extended techniques
such as singing and playing simultaneously, or speaking syl-
lables into the instrument. A method of providing haptic
feedback could also be implemented, which could be used to
simulate the vibrations experienced when playing an acous-
tic wind instrument.
