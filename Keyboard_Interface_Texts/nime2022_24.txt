ABSTRACT
Physical metaphor provides a visceral and universal logical framework for composing 
musical gestures. Physical simulations can aid composers in creating musical gestures 
based in complex physical metaphors. CHON (Coupled Harmonic Oscillator Network) 
is a new cross-platform application for composing musical gestures based in 
Newtonian physics. It simulates a network of particles connected by springs and 
sonifies the motion of individual particles. CHON is an interactive instrument that can 
provide complex yet tangible and physically grounded control data for synthesis, sound 
processing, and musical score generation. Composers often deploy dozens of 
independent LFOs to control various parameters in a DAW or synthesizer. By coupling 
numerous control signals together using physical principles, CHON represents an 
innovation on the traditional LFO model of musical control. Unlike independent LFOs, 
CHON’s signals push and pull on each other, creating a tangible causality in the 
resulting gestures. In this paper, I briefly describe the design of CHON and discuss its 
use in composition through examples in my own works.

Introduction
Physical gesture is a powerful metaphor for constructing musical narrative. Using 
physical metaphors, a composer can forge cohesion between disparate elements of a 
piece and create a sense of causality. In the 20th century, composers began to overtly 
incorporate physics and physical metaphors into their music. Edgard Varèse described 
his conception of music using physical language such as "sound-mass," "attraction-
repulsion," and "shifting planes" [1]. György Ligeti used a literal physical system (100 
metronomes) in his Poéme Symphonique [2].
The metronomes in Ligeti’s Poéme Symphonique act as independent oscillators ticking 
at their own rate. This is a mechanical version of the Low Frequency Oscillators (LFOs) 
that are regularly used by composers of electronic music. Periodic oscillators are

ubiquitous in nature and they are of fundamental importance in physics. However, an 
infinite sine wave (or other waveform) that doesn’t decay or vary in time is an abstract 
concept. Real oscillators exist in networks of causality and influence, they are acted 
upon and they act on other objects. This is why the model of coupled harmonic 
oscillators is of such profound interest to scientists.
A basic coupled harmonic oscillation system consists of two masses attached with 
springs, such as the pendulums in Image 1. In such a system, energy is passed back 
and forth between oscillators and complex motion can arise from the superposition of 
modes, especially as the number of oscillators in the system increases.
Coupled oscillators (in the form of mass-spring models) also play a central role in the 
field of physical modeling synthesis. Physical modeling synthesis is largely focused on 
re-synthesizing believable facsimiles of real instruments [3][4]. It is also less commonly 
used for creating fantastical virtual instruments of unreal proportions or 
configurations [5][6][7]. Claude Cadoz and others at ACROE in Grenoble pioneered the 
use of the mass-spring model in physical modeling [8]. They generalized mass-spring 
models into what they call a mass-interaction scheme, where, in addition to more 
standard mass-spring situations, particles may be lumped into unique configurations 
and the forces connecting them may be non-linear [9]. Research into  the mass-
interaction model  has continued at GIPSA-lab, resulting in the MI-gen~ Max/MSP 
toolbox [10]. MI-gen~ allows Max users to construct custom virtual physical systems 
using modular building blocks (Max objects). PMPD is a similar toolbox for the Pure 
Data environment [11].

Though this kind of system is well-known in physical modeling, the perspective has 
most often been focused on how the sum total of the system simulates an object such 
as a string. In mass-interaction schemes, even though the atomic units of masses and 
forces are available to the user, these units are treated as modules to build up a virtual 
instrument. An application in which the individual oscillators or masses are treated as 
voices in their own right to create, for example, contrapuntal structures and cascading 
antiphonic forms, remains to be explored. I am speaking of using a coupled oscillator 
system as a new kind of LFO, or an LFO network, that is tangible, physical, and causal. 
With an LFO system such as this, a composer can drive synthesis parameters or 
musical score generation with a modulation scheme grounded in real phenomena. It 
was an interest in this application of coupled harmonic oscillators that led me to create 
CHON [12].
CHON (Coupled Harmonic Oscillator Network) is a real-time interactive application for 
generating musical material and control signals by using a simulation of coupled 
harmonic oscillators as an interface. CHON is not meant to be a scheme for physical 
modeling synthesis, but rather a control signal scheme for shaping musical parameters 
using physically plausible interactions. Rather than an innovation in physical modeling 
synthesis, I consider CHON to be an innovation on the traditional LFO (Low Frequency 
Oscillator) model. 
CHON differs further from projects such as MI-gen~ in that it requires no knowledge 
of the Max environment, computer programming, physics, or other specialized skills. 
CHON is used by directly clicking and dragging oscillators on screen. This intervention 
sets the coupled oscillator system into a chain reaction. The user can then let the 
system evolve on its own, change parameters of the simulation such as the stiffness of 
springs or the damping coefficient, or click an oscillator to interrupt the flow of the 
system directly.
The balance of the precise simulation of a physical system against the direct user 
interaction makes CHON a hybrid algorithmic-heuristic tool, allowing intuitive 
intervention in an otherwise rigidly deterministic system. The musical gestures that 
one can create with CHON range from trite (a sine wave) to chaotic (dozens of 
mutually dependent oscillators), but they are nonetheless tangible because of their 
connection to the physical world.

Physics
A simple harmonic oscillator can be represented by a single mass on a spring. The 
behavior of springs (within elastic limits) is well described by Hooke’s Law. Hooke’s 
law [13] can be stated as: the restoring force  of a spring is linearly proportional to to 
its displacement. Mathematically:
Where  is a constant "stiffness" of the spring, and  is the displacement of the spring 
away from equilibrium. Newton’s second law gives us the mathematical means to 
calculate other important properties of an object in motion [14]:
Where  is the object’s mass and  is it’s acceleration. This equation, when combined 
with Hooke’s law, can give us more information about a harmonic oscillator:
And re-arranging to find our desired property:

By calculating the acceleration of the particle, we can update the velocity of the 
particle at each time step in the simulation. The physics simulation of CHON employs a 
forward Euler method. This method was chosen for its simplicity and relatively low 
computational cost. The forward Euler method solves numerical integration using an 
explicit method. This means that the state of the system at every time step of the 
simulation is calculated from the state at the previous time step.
If we add another particle to this system and affix (via springs) both particles to 
unmoving anchors and to each other, we now have a basic coupled harmonic oscillator 
system as seen in Image 3 . Now, each particle can experience a force from the spring 
attached to the anchor as well as the spring attached to the other particle. Each of 
these forces is a vector. The addition of these vectors will give us the net force on the 
particle.
Substituting for hooke’s law we get:
Now, one of the connections is in motion. With this, we now have to take into account 
the displacement from equilibrium of both particles(  and ), the difference of which 
will determine our .
And substituting into our previous equation:
Dividing  by  will then give us the acceleration for the particle, which we can use 
to update the velocity of the particle at the simulation framerate (60 Hz).
As particles are added to this system, it approaches a simulation of a string. This is the 
basis for the mass-spring method of string physical modeling (PM) synthesis. CHON

bears a superficial resemblance to mass-spring PM synthesis, but their goals differ. In 
PM synthesis, each individual mass in the mass-spring system only matters inasmuch 
as it contributes to the overall string simulation. CHON uses a mass-spring system to 
simulate coupled particles and generate control data from each particle. The behavior 
of each individual particle is the central focus in CHON.
Whereas in a string simulation each mass typically moves only transversely 
(perpendicular to the length of the string), the masses in CHON move in up to 3 
dimensions, according to user preference. In addition to laying out coupled harmonic 
oscillators in 1-dimension like a string, CHON can arrange up to 100 particles in a 2-
dimensional plane or a 3-dimensional cuboid (see Image 4).

Interface
CHON was designed to allow the user to interact with the particle system as directly 
and intuitively as possible. The visual interface consists of the particle system itself, a 
graph readout of all the particle displacements, and a GUI (Graphical User Interface) 
for changing various parameters of the system (see Image 5). The auditory interface of 
CHON consists of various optional synthesis algorithms. CHON accepts user input via 
mouse and keyboard. The audio engine and the visual interface of CHON were 
facilitated by the Allolib C++ framework [15].

Visual Interface
CHON's visual interface is dominated by the particle simulation in the center of the 
screen. It is roughly skeuomorphic — the kind of particle system it simulates is 
mimicked in the visual representation on screen. The spheres on screen are analogous 
to the masses in a mass-spring system, and if you displace the system, it behaves as 
you would expect a real mass-spring system to behave. The particles where given 
different colors to differentiate them and to allow them to be mapped to the 2D 
displacement graph.
The displacement graph is located above the particle simulation on the screen. In the 
graph, there is a line for each particle that is mapped to the same color as the particle 
it represents. The graph shows the displacement of each particle from its equilibrium 
position in a particular axis. The user may choose which axis is graphed using the GUI 
described below. The graph serves as an additional readout for the user that allows 
them to understand the dynamics of the system better. It also provides a way to 
visualize the displacement data that can be broadcast over OSC.
The GUI of CHON presents further options to control the program. It is divided in to 
four windows: Display, Physics, Synthesis, Audio, and OSC. The windows are arranged

on the left side of the screen, and each one can be collapsed or expanded using the 
triangle in the top-left of the window. Pressing "g" on the keyboard shows/hides the 
GUI.
The Display window controls what is visible and some other aspects of visual display. 
The Physics window allows the user to alter the physical properties of the CHON 
simulation. The Synthesis window provides control over the internal sound engine of 
CHON. The Audio window allows the user to change and configure the audio input and 
output devices. The OSC window provides control over the OSC broadcasting 
functionality of CHON.
Auditory Interface
Though more powerful and flexible sound design is possible by pairing CHON with an 
external audio application, the internal sound engine in CHON can generate 
compelling results. There are two main paradigms under which the sound engine 
operates: Continuous and Trigger.
The continuous paradigm is represented by the "additive synth" in the sound engine. 
The additive synth generates a sine tone for each particle in CHON, the frequency of 
which can be set by the global tuning menu or individually by right clicking on each 
particle. The continuous movement of the particle in any direction can then be coupled 
to either an Amplitude Modulation (AM) or Frequency Modulation (FM) effect. The AM 
coupling ties the amplitude of the sine tone of each particle to the displacement of that 
particle (see . The FM coupling ties the width of the FM effect to the displacement of 
the particle. For example, if AM is coupled to the x axis, and the particle moves in the x 
axis, then the amplitude will gradually increase and decrease with the particle’s 
displacement. This is the reason for calling it the "continuous" paradigm.

The trigger paradigm is represented by the bell synth. The bell synth is a sine tone 
tuned according to user-defined settings, with an amplitude envelope governed by a 1-
second ADSR. The ADSR envelope is triggered whenever the particle crosses its 
equilibrium point in the selected axis. This allows cascading effects where each

particle triggers its bell sound and pushes the next particle to trigger its bell sound 
and so on(see Video 3).
CHON’s audio engine also includes a reverb with an adjustable decay time, a tuning 
functionality to adjust the pitch of each particle’s sound output, a stereo panning 
feature which can place each particle’s sound in a stereo soundfield according to the 
particle’s position in the simulation, and audio input driving.

CHON’s audio input driving allows it to simulate another fundamental oscillation 
model in physics: the driven oscillator. With audio input driving, the driving force 
acting on CHON is an audio signal from a microphone or another application. Using 
the Audio IO Settings module, the user can select an audio input source and CHON 
will begin listening. The Input module, pictured in Image 6, allows the user to 
configure the input driving parameters.

With this feature, CHON can not only be activated by displacing particles with the 
mouse, but can also respond to audio input and be set in motion with sonic energy. 
This motion could then activate the internal synthesis engine of CHON(see Video 5). 
Alternatively, the data of the motion of the particles can be sent out via OSC to another 
application or synthesizer. One can set up CHON for music with a live performer in 
which the sound of the performer drives CHON in sympathetic resonance.

Applications
CHON can be used to generate sound with its internal sound engine or by sending the 
data to an external application such as a DAW, a visual programming environment like 
Max or Pure Data, or even a physical synthesizer that accepts OSC data. Pairing the 
OSC output of CHON with a digital audio workstation, one could map the displacement 
of each particle to the panning or volume of various tracks. CHON could also control 
audio processing parameters on each track such as filter frequency, reverb wet/dry 
signal, pitch shift, distortion/saturation level, and others. I have also heard from 
composers who have used CHON with the virtual modular synthesis software 
VCVRack. Another user paired CHON with a Processing sketch to create generative 
visual art.
In my own work Psi (2021), I use CHON to generate sound based in classical physics to 
contrast against the quantum mechanical principles driving the rest of the piece. I 
made use of CHON’s internal audio engine as well as its OSC capabilities to drive 
synthesis parameters and spatialization in other applications such as EmissionControl2 
[16] and Pulsar~ [17](see Video 6). This generated synthesized sound and sound 
processing effects rooted in a physically deterministic and tangible system.

I used CHON to generate a score for two pianos in my miniature piece Pandæmonium 
(2020), in response to a call for very short compositions of 1 minute or less by the LA-
based piano duo Hocket. I set up a 4-particle system in CHON mapped to the four 
hands of the pianists and sent the OSC output to an algorithmic music composition tool 
called SCAMP created by Marc Evanstein [18]. I configured SCAMP to interpret the 
OSC data as the contour of a unique arpeggio for each hand. Each of the 4 particles 
dictated the movement of one hand of the performers, so that the movement of the 
performers hands to the right and left of the keyboard would reflect the movement of 
the particles from right to left in CHON. The displacement data of each particle was 
quantized to a different scale. I decided that the entire piece would be one single 
gesture. I set CHON into motion and configured the damping effect so that the 
particles would come to rest after about one minute. The result is like a sonic explosion 
that gradually dissipates while each arpeggio pushes and pulls on one another.
Conclusions
Classical physics offers a visceral and universal logical framework for music [19]. For 
the composer interested in imbuing electroacoustic music with physically tangible 
gestures, synthesis and musical control based on physical simulations can help expand 
creativity.

CHON is in ongoing development, with new features added as recently as December 
2021. It is open-source (GPLv3 license) and the code as well as pre-built binaries for 
Linux, Mac, and Windows are free to download at 
https://github.com/rodneydup/CHON. Anyone is welcome to download and alter the 
code and contribute to the project. As the scope of CHON is expanded, the interface 
should be continually refined to make it as accessible and user-friendly as possible, 
preserving the immediate gratification of opening the application and setting the 
system into motion. To this end, the author plans to organize a user study to gain 
feedback and to evaluate the software and user experience more rigorously. Some 
interesting directions for CHON would be to add compatibility with gestural control 
interfaces such as LeapMotion [20] or Wekinator [21], user-defined presets, and more 
spatial and physical configurations for the coupled oscillator networks.
CHON is a powerful tool for composers seeking to explore systems of coupled 
harmonic oscillators. It is easy to begin using, but sophisticated enough for advanced 
use-cases. The user can set CHON into motion and it will produce a chain reaction on 
its own from there. However, the user can also intervene to interrupt a moving 
particle, break symmetry, and cause new ripples, waves, and explosions.
