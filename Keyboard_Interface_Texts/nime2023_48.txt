ABSTRACT
Subtlety and detail are fundamental to what makes musi-
cal instruments special, and worth dedicating a life’s prac-
tice to, for designer, maker, player and listener alike. How-
ever, research into digital musical instrument (DMI) design
tools and processes have so far mainly focused on high-level
conceptual concerns and low-level technical abstractions,
leaving subtlety and detail underexplored and undervalued.
These nuances, and the processes they result from, cannot
be fully articulated in words alone, yet they largely define
an instrument’s quality, and it is therefore important to
understand how they come to be. We introduce a scale-
based ontology that divides design details into three levels
- macro, meso and micro - and we present a literature re-
view of DMI design from the perspective of this ontology.
Finally we extrapolate the ontology to consider its utility
in broader contexts, and consider future directions.

give the 808 its distinctive sizzling sound. In
fact, this tiny component, also known as an 2SC828-
R, was so important to the final sound, that once
supplies were used up, the TR-808 was discon-
tinued.” – Roland, The TR-808 Story[92]
When comparing two violins, the differences in quality
will be stark if one is crafted by a master luthier, whilst
the other by a student. Similar issues prevail with ana-
logue electronic instruments; not only were the details of
the 2SC828-R precision manufactured, but they were also
subtly different and uniquely suited to its task. Thus far,
subtle details have been the Achilles heel of digital musi-
cal instruments (DMIs), with significant efforts in recent
decades dedicated to defining, increasing, and evaluating
their expressivity. Nonetheless, DMI design practitioners,
technologists, and researchers continue to face complex is-
sues when addressing subtlety and detail.
In a previous paper [10], we discussed violin luthiers’ abil-
ity to concentrate on subtle details due to the ecological, cul-
tural, and technical constraints on their practice. Following
this, we conducted two studies where instrument makers
focused on subtle details in one-hour activities [8, 9], but
these did not produce subtle, detailed outcomes or what we
refer to as micro design scale. In the first study, a sim-
ple, modular DMI design toolkit was paired with crafting
materials, which produced what we refer to as macro scale
outcomes [8] (Figure 2). In the first study, a modular DMI
design toolkit was combined with crafting materials lead-
ing to macro scale outcomes [8] (Figure 2). In the second
study, the same toolkit was integrated with a Pure Data
patch, and meso scale outcomes became more apparent [9,
4]. In a third study [6, 5], we designed an apparatus and
activity with more deliberate constraints at the macro and
meso scales, allowing us to observe largely uninterrupted
micro scale DMI design.
In this paper, we present an ontology of DMI design that
was developed alongside our empirical studies of DMI design
processes. Initially devised to guide our practical investiga-
tions towards subtlety and detail, we now offer it as a reflec-
tion on DMI design research, methods, tools, frameworks,
and practices. We describe each scale in turn, comparing
with existing literature as we progress. Finally, we discuss
the general utility of the ontology and outline potential ways
it could be further developed or adapted to support other
researchers interested in similar topics.
Where each scale considers digital musical instruments, and
their underlying design processes:
the macro scale deﬁnes forms and functions of
instruments across ecologies
the meso scale deﬁnes conﬁguration and mappings across
taxonomically similar instruments
the micro scale deﬁnes subtle and detailed nuances between
otherwise identical instruments

2. SCALE-BASED ONTOLOGY OVERVIEW
This section offers inductive and categorical definitions for
the scale-based ontology of DMI design, whose absolute-
ness we will later challenge in Section 6. In 2005, Jord` a
sought to provide a means of comparing performances with
DMIs at three levels of abstraction, referring to the musical
diversity of an instrument [55]. He introduced the terms
macro, mid, and micro-diversity; macro-diversity pertains
to an instrument’s ability to accommodate different styles,
mid-diversity relates to an instrument’s ability to support
playing different pieces, and micro-diversity concerns the
potential for performances of the same piece to differ. By
repurposing the latter definition to focus on instrument de-
sign processes rather than performances, we can propose an
operational definition for micro scale details: subtle and de-
tailed nuances between otherwise identical instruments and
their underlying design processes.
Consider constructing two DMIs of the same design while
aiming to make them as similar as possible (or comparing
the same DMI post-design revision); there would always
be distinctions between them. The more similar these two
DMIs are, the greater the level of subtlety and detail re-
quired to determine and evaluate their differences. Our
definition assumes that the design processes behind these
differences somehow produce them. In contrast, taxonomi-
cal frameworks compare high-level features like interactive
paradigms [60] and features neither high nor low-level, such
as mapping configurations or numbers of inputs and out-
puts [46]. Analogous to Jord` a’s levels of musical diversity,
these frameworks could address macro and mid or meso
scale differences between DMIs and their underlying design
processes. While numerous frameworks address macro and
meso scales, the micro scale has received far less attention.
This scale-based ontology of DMI design is summarised in
two ways in Figure 1, with a comprehensive account in
[2]. Comparing each definitions’ attributes and contexts
can help to reinforce their intended meaning:
• Forms and functions differ across instrumental ecologies(macro),
but are the same in taxonomically similar instruments (meso)
and otherwise identical ones (micro).
• Configuration and mappings are closely related across taxo-
nomically similar instruments (meso), vary widely across in-
strumental ecologies (macro), and are subtly different in oth-
erwise identical ones (micro).
• Otherwise identical instruments have the same form and func-
tion (macro), and the same configuration and mappings(meso),
and are distinguished via their subtle and detailed nuances
(micro).
The Reactable [56], Seaboard [57], and Svampolin [84]
are innovative DMIs that emphasise different aspects of
the scale-based ontology in their design and functionality.
The Reactable, emphasising macro and meso scales, intro-
duces a collaborative round table interface and a unique
radial configuration of components. The Seaboard, focus-
ing on meso and micro scales, implements MPE for re-
sponsiveness on a modified MIDI keyboard, enabling de-
tailed gesture-based interactions. The Svampolin prioritises
macro and micro scales by maintaining the traditional violin
form while employing a hybrid acoustic-electric design with
subtle differences in playing experience. Comparatively, the
Reactable presents a novel form factor for collaboration,
while the Seaboard and Svampolin enhance traditional in-
struments. Regarding meso scale designs, the Reactable em-
ploys tangible control, the Seaboard features a responsive
surface, and the Svampolin integrates an electric violin with
an acoustic body. In terms of micro scale differences, the
Reactable’s visual feedback, Seaboard’s sensor responses,
and the Svampolin’s unique acoustic characteristics could
impact the playing experience. However, the Svampolin’s
playing experience is most likely to be influenced by differ-
ences in resonance and timbre, due to inherent variations in
wood density, grain patterns, and internal structure of the
instrument.
To take another example, consider the grand piano. From
this ontology’s perspective, a prepared grand piano often
represents a macro scale change in the instrument’s form
and function, involving a reconfiguration of its meso scale
and introducing a new domain of micro scale details orthog-
onal to its previous idioms. In contrast, the Magnetic Res-
onator Piano (MRP), an electromagnetic augmentation of
the grand piano, undertakes meso scale interventions while
maintaining the existing macro, meso, and micro scale de-
tails of the original instrument [70, 71]. Both scenarios may
involve underlying design processes that are subtle and de-
tailed, but the MRP’s context suggests that it would need
to focus on considerable subtlety, whereas prepared pianos
deliberately allow a broad space for high-level artistic ex-
ploration. Comparing two prepared pianos would not nec-
essarily reveal comparable subtle details at the micro scale,
since they may also be very different at the meso and macro
scale, but comparing two MRPs would. This does not imply
that DMI design always commences at the macro scale and
progresses linearly and hierarchically towards the micro, as
we discuss later in Section 6.
As the adage goes, the map is not the territory, but we
find that this map has helped us gain clarity on subtlety and
detail in DMI design, which we subsequently translated into
practical enquiries providing further insights. We offer this
ontology with a spirit of pragmatic curiosity, rather than
being driven by a desire for an all-encompassing theory. As
ontologies serve as models, and every model has its limita-
tions, it is crucial to recognise that this ontology’s primary
objective is to assist in directing our subjective viewpoints
on subtlety and detail in DMI design, rather than claiming
to represent a fixed, external reality:
1. A great deal of DMI design research and practice addresses
primarily high-level concerns, leaving subtlety and detail un-
derexplored, and undervalued.
2. DMI design tools, frameworks and methods tend to medi-
ate design processes in obfuscated and unacknowledged ways,
through rigid high-level choices and low-level abstractions,
rarely considering the needs of subtle and detailed design pro-
cesses.
3. Addressing and understanding the subtleties and details of
DMIs, and their underlying design processes, is both an im-
portant and tractable goal for the field.
4. Clearly defining the first two issues is a helpful first step to-
wards addressing the third, but observation-inspired models
of subtle and detailed DMI design processes, at first in isola-
tion from other concerns, will ultimately be a greater incentive
for future research.
3. THE MICRO SCALE: SUBTLETY & DETAIL
Longitudinal ethnographies [103] and reflections on prac-
tice [23] are a primary source for accounts of micro scale
details [102]. Michel Waisvisz notably developed three dis-
tinct versions of his DMI The Hands, over a time span of
more than twenty years [107, 28]. Torre and Andersen de-
scribe that Version 2 (“the customisation phase”) spanned
between 1990-2000, after which came Version 3:
The differences between these two versions are min-
imal compared to Version 1 [...] After the finalisa-
tion of version 3 of The Hands, Waisvisz made the
decision to stop developing and accept the physical
layout as is. From this point onwards, he concen-
trated on refining [...] it became possible to focus on
the musical intent beyond the novelty of the devices.
[102]
Waisvisz was largely driven by personal musical needs,
a common theme among digital luthiers who often design
for themselves and require time to cultivate their musical
practice. The Hands represented such a novel concept that
Waiswisz, along with other practitioners developing glove-
based instruments like Sonami [95, 33], initially had to in-
vestigate macro and meso scales of DMI design spaces, even-
tually narrowing down to the micro scale.
On the other hand, not all DMI design processes move
from macro to micro, and McPherson’s Magnetic Resonator
Piano (MRP) [70] serves as a notable counterexample. Ini-
tially, he casually experimented with electromagnetic ac-
tuation of piano strings, inspired by the guitarists’ EBow 1
rather than similar piano augmentations, of which he was
unaware at the time. Much like Waiswisz, McPherson was
driven by musical necessity; as a composer, he sought a
means to introduce creative elements into his PhD compo-
sitions for solo piano, in which“the piece could exist without
the technology”:
What I had in mind was the idea that you would
have something that was still recognizable as a piano
but had a sort of extraordinary range of tone color,
especially the idea that you can kind of separate the
timbre from the the dynamics. 2

While practitioners had to invent macro and meso scales
for The Hands and similar instruments, the MRP aimed
to preserve the existing macro and meso scale aspects of
the grand piano, extending its micro scale domains with
minimal disruption. In recent years, there has been a grow-
ing interest in research regarding DMI design methods and
practices that emphasise subtlety and detail. Jack et al. un-
derscore the advantages of conducting in-the-wild research
[91] by framing DMI research artefacts as polished products
rather than functional prototypes.
The differences in physical properties of what is con-
sidered a probe or product might be subtle, or even
non-existent [...] Importantly, research products place
an equal emphasis on non-technical design choices
such as materiality, ‘feel’, and visual aesthetics.[50]
These subtleties become foregrounded further still when
considering the issue of DMI replicability [19, 20]. Zayas et
al. investigated this through the intimate lens of appren-
ticeship, where an apprentice aimed for exact replication of
a DMI, under the supervision of the original designers [111]:
One of the most salient points of shared tacit knowl-
edge was when the designer disassembled one of the
strings and demonstrated how to achieve the opti-
mal tension in the string. Achieving this requires
that one plucks the string repeatedly while tighten-
ing it in order to get both a feel of the string and to
make sure it is not producing an audible tone.
Practice-based accounts, such as these, raise intriguing
questions about the development of expertise concerning
subtle details and how it is reflected in design processes and
tool usage. However, the resolution of these accounts is cur-
rently quite limited, and in our studies we have attempted
to address this [6, 5]. In all of the above cases, though sub-
tle and detailed DMI design issues are present, they are not
visible in specifics. A crucial first step to uncovering micro
scale details involves isolating them from other aspects of
DMIs and their underlying design processes. The follow-
ing section initiates this process by distinguishing between
meso and micro scale DMI design.
4. THE MESO SCALE: CONFIGURATION
& MAPPINGS
Practitioners undoubtedly use popular tools such as Ar-
duino and Max/MSP for intricate DMI designs. However,
despite toolmakers’ claims of limitlessness, we believe based
on our studies [9, 4] that these tools chiefly support meso
scale configuration and mapping of DMIs. At the micro
scale, details are often entirely abstracted away or inade-
quately facilitated. Additionally, we refer to existing liter-
ature that identifies these tools as embedding macro scale
assumptions that users may accept either knowingly or oth-
erwise. The meso scale sits between form and detail, a space
demarcated by negating both macro and micro, and inhab-
ited by explicit DMI design philosophy and expertise.
4.1 Meso Versus Micro
DMI design toolkits serve as beneficial aids, streamlining
implementation details into modular components that facil-
itate rapid exploration. These toolkits reflect specific mu-
sical cultures and knowledge [61], such as instrument clas-
sification systems [21] and synthesis approaches. Through
abstraction, they achieve greater flexibility enabling inno-
vative recombinations. Yet, as Perner-Wilson et al. remind
Figure 2: Outcomes from our first study combining a simple, modular DMI design toolkit with open-ended crafting materials,
which we identified as producing predominantly macro scale outcomes, with the instruments diverging in their form and
function [8].
us, “Modularity comes at the cost of constraint [...] They
constrain what we build and how we think.” [86]
Indeed, this approach often constrains the DMI design
space to a predefined, combinatorial set of possible instru-
ments, merely offering designers a curated selection of com-
ponents. This resembles a simplified version of DMI design,
akin to GuitarHero being a representation of playing guitar
[11], or the notion that ”everyone can play music” often as-
sociated with commercial DMIs [73]. While this approach
holds value, it struggles to address micro scale details effec-
tively.
Toolkit modularity tends to standardise micro scale de-
tails for compatibility, often sacrificing material subtlety.
For instance, tangible media markers perform uniform func-
tions irrespective of materiality [88], and recognition sys-
tems abstract those aspects away [43]. Although expert
toolkit users can overcome such influences [13], beginners
might inadvertently conflate a toolkit’s perspective with the
entire discipline [79].
While not all DMI design tools neglect micro scale de-
tails—platforms like Bela and Elk 3 promote subtle and de-
tailed musical interactions [75, 80, 104]—there is still room
for improvement. Although these platforms have facilitated
closer examination of factors like latency and tangibility for
DMI performers [49], DMI designers’ haptic, tactile, and
spatial abilities remain comparatively overlooked [16].
Considering the embodied craft process, DMI designers
using these platforms may face constraints in displaying or
manipulating micro scale details. The embodied expertise
offered by existing DMI design tools and platforms often
suffers from multiple levels of indirection [48], distancing de-
signers from the behaviour they wish to create. As a result,
designers may gain limited physical experience, hindering
the development of their specialist tacit expertise.
To address these limitations, we suggest a deeper em-
brace of embodiment in digital lutherie, enabling luthiers
to utilise their full bodily capabilities for creating and ex-
periencing micro scale details. An efficient micro scale DMI
design tool may benefit from a dedicated Bela-like device.
Ideally, using DMI design tools should be as embodied as
playing DMIs, as the machine that creates the machine of-
ten demands greater subtlety or sophistication—an idea evi-
dent in the meticulous tool-sharpening undertaken by violin
luthiers.

4.2 Meso Versus Macro
Mapping is a well-cited DMI design topic and a staple of
NIME publications over the years [31]. Established early
in NIME’s history [47, 45, 106], mapping has continuously
gained attention, leading to numerous published frameworks,
strategies, and tools. Much of the discourse around map-
ping toolkits is fundamentally meso in scale. These toolk-
its already assume a particular data flow architecture, usu-
ally consisting of temporally static relationships between
features tied together with numerical weights and trans-
formations. DMI designers leveraging these tools can ex-
plore numerous mapping possibilities but remain confined
to the mapping mindset. Exceptions include those who mas-
ter the tool, transcending its limitations or repurposing it
[25]—though, in such cases, they could consider creating a
new tool from scratch.
Not all DMIs require a mapping-centric design approach;
exploring alternative paradigms reveals a landscape of truly
macro scale differences. Magnusson elaborates on these con-
ceptual features as epistemic dimensions inadvertently en-
coded into tools by designers [61]. Imagine a hypothetical
pianist, unfamiliar with any other instrument—how limited
would their understanding of non-pianistic music be [40]?
DMI design tools similarly encode worldviews that remain
hidden unless one has experienced others and adopts a well-
traveled paradigmatic outlook.
Borrowing expressions like ”can’t see the wood for the
trees” and ”if all you have is a hammer, everything looks
like a nail” helps illustrate this concept. Abstracting this
sentiment, meso scale frameworks or tools, if considered in
isolation, appear to possess macro scale characteristics; if
all you know is a specific meso scale framework or tool, the
space you are in will appear to be macro in character.
Sound and music computing (SMC) languages, such as
[69, 109, 89], also perpetuate a meso scale illusion of uni-
versality [74, 72, 94]. This claim stems from two sources:
the technical computational universality of Turing-complete
SMC languages and the similarities between programming
and natural language relative to most other tools [24]. Be-
ware the ”Turing tar-pit”, where although ”everything is
possible—nothing of interest is easy” [85]. Expecting mon-
keys to create Shakespeare by randomly typing may not
appeal to audiences desiring results within their lifetimes!
Tools like Max/MSP pose various difficulties due to these
unrealistic expectations, as Snape and Born discuss [94].
5. THE MACRO SCALE: FORM & FUNCTION
At the macro scale of DMI design, designers concentrate
on the overall form and function of digital musical instru-
ments, aiming to create innovative and expressive tools that
either expand on existing concepts or introduce entirely new
paradigms for music making. In this domain, designers usu-
ally emphasise broader conceptual aspects, such as inter-
face metaphors, instrument ecologies, and interactions with
other musicians or external systems. To operate effectively
at the macro scale, designers must consider factors like
user experience, ergonomics, accessibility, and cultural res-
onance, frequently utilising various design methodologies,
such as participatory design, user-centred design, or eth-
nomethodological considerations. Figure 2 illustrates some
of these concerns in the outcomes of one of our workshop-
studies [8]. As Bates elucidates, a DMI’s role can be con-
textually equivocal, with the same instrument suggesting
different relations in various sociohistorical settings [12].
Since NIME began, the field of DMI design has experi-
enced considerable advancements in technology, leading to
a growing emphasis on macro and meso scale aspects, as
more instruments investigate the potential of novel inter-
face designs and configurations. In turn, this has undoubt-
edly resulted in experimental aesthetics playing a dominant
role in DMI performances [22, 78, 83, 110, 82]. Numerous
taxonomical analyses and evaluation frameworks have also
been developed, similarly focusing on high-level concerns
[53, 52]. However, the importance of micro scale factors
should not be overlooked, as they significantly contribute
to defining the character and unique appeal of a particular
instrument. Whilst many DMIs build upon proven design
concepts, it is arguably the integration of macro, meso, and
micro scale elements that often results in a well-balanced,
expressive, and engaging instrument that appeals to a wide
range of users. Anderson and Gibson, adopting this holistic
perspective, frame the meaning of “new” in NIME:
A new instrument provides an intuitive interface be-
tween gesture and sound; it allows for the develop-
ment of virtuosity [...] can provide long-lasting and
fulfilling interactions that exceed the novelty of its
modifications and extensions [...] capable of surpris-
ing the performer and allowing the continual renewal
of musical possibilities. [1]
In recent years, discussions surrounding politics, equity,
inclusivity, diversity, and environmental issues have sub-
stantially influenced critical discourse and decision-making
within macro-scale DMI design. DMI design communities
are embracing various stances, including practice-based [39,
54, 100], ecological [96, 37, 30], and anti-solutionist [59, 81],
with analogous patterns observed in related fields such as
organology [27, 26, 63]. Designers are becoming more atten-
tive to fostering diversity in musical expression, accessibil-
ity for individuals with disabilities, and cultural inclusivity,
aiming to develop tools that cater to broader audiences and
promote social, cultural, and ecological awareness. More-
over, sustainable design practices are gaining prominence,
with designers focusing on reducing waste and environmen-
tal impact, using eco-friendly materials, and enhancing en-
ergy efficiency. This evolving discourse has expanded the
landscape of DMI design, making it more conscious of socio-
political and cultural contexts, as well as ecological respon-
sibilities, and these macro scale concerns continue to impact
DMI design at the meso and micro scales.
6. EXTRAPOLATING THE ONTOLOGY
Thus far, the scale-based ontology of DMI design has been
introduced, serving to accentuate and scrutinise the intri-
cacies of detailed DMI design. Three distinctive scales have
been proposed: the micro scale, which encompasses the nu-
ances, and the meso and macro scales, which do not. By
isolating the micro scale, it has become possible to initi-
ate an understanding of its practical investigation. Now,
we shall broaden our focus, moving away from the micro
scale to explore the full expanse of the ontology, and its
limitations.
6.1 Ambiguity of DMIs as Design Objects
Over 100 NIME papers, approximately 5% of the total lit-
erature, feature ”controller” in the title, and likely many
more discuss controllers without mentioning them in the ti-
tle. Whilst acoustic and electronic musical instruments have
long exhibited decoupled mechanisms [66], decoupling is al-
most an overt idiomatic feature of numerous DMIs, given
current technology allows for it so arbitrarily and discretely.
The benefits of separating sound from the source are man-
ifold, including pedagogical [84] and aesthetic [68] advan-
tages, but this gives rise to the “problem” of mapping, as
DMI design decisions must be made where no choice previ-
ously existed. Entire practices are established around this
notion, such as modular synthesis [35] and gestural music
controllers, which have become a specialised sub-field in the
NIME community [108, 17, 51, 97, 76]. How do these sce-
narios challenge the ontology?
Regarding familiar instruments, like the guitar, the appli-
cability of scale-based ontology may be debatable. Guitars
have seen significant decoupling and reconfiguration explo-
ration. Harrison et al. discuss performances featuring var-
ious guitar-like instruments, questioning when the essence
of the guitar may become uncertain, causing identity crises
and disintegration [42]. Answers to such questions are sub-
jective and context-dependent, and understanding this am-
biguity is crucial for DMI designers, particularly in Accesi-
ble DMIs (ADMIs) [41]. From an ontological perspective,
investigating the scales contrasting these guitar variations
is vital for deeper exploration and comprehension.
If a controller is examined in isolation, should it be consid-
ered a meso scale device, as it cannot produce music with-
out pairing with a sound source? Controllers possess their
own forms and functions, which can be compared across,
seemingly contradicting this notion, yet both positions ap-
pear valid. What is the ontological status of DMI practices
focused on evolving assemblages [15, 98, 112, 87]? Simi-
larly, how should networked and distributed DMIs’ scales
be characterised [18, 58, 77]? Are instruments created with
meta instruments considered meso scale [34, 32, 14]? Is it
feasible to interpret composed instruments [93] in terms of
Jord` a’s scales of musical diversity and the scale-based ontol-
ogy of DMIs? What about instruments as scores [99, 101],
and live coding as both instrument [90] and score [62]? In
all these cases, identifying the macro, meso, or micro scale
becomes challenging, and the ontology does not always of-
fer additional clarity or insight. However, when comparing
two similar artefacts, subtle details once again become dis-
cernible. Sensor calibration and processing in controllers,
latency and jitter characteristics in networked music sys-
tems, and domain-specific syntax in live coding are all sub-
tle, but significant.
6.2 Non-Linear DMI Design Processes
Prototypes serve to isolate specific design issues and demar-
cate phases, as Houde and Hill (Figure 3) describe in a case
study:
Three prototypes were developed almost in paral-
Figure 3: “Four principal categories of prototypes”described
by Houde and Hill [44].
lel. They were built by different design team mem-
bers during the early stages of the project. No sin-
gle prototype could have represented the design of
the future artifact at that time. Making separate
prototypes enabled specific design questions to be
addressed with as much clarity as possible. The so-
lutions found became inputs to an integrated design.
[44]
Although DMI designers often work individually, they fre-
quently employ similar iterative prototyping methods [103,
36, 105]. This characteristic extends the scale-based ontol-
ogy in intriguing ways. The separation of concerns, utilised
by designers, might be viewed as a temporal equivalent of
the decoupling depicted in the previous section.
Considering Figure 3, a straightforward analogy could be
drawn between Role, Implementation, and Look and feel
prototypes and the ontology’s macro, meso, and micro scales,
respectively. However, another approach would consider
the areas surrounding the four points as highly subtle and
detailed, with the areas farthest from the points exhibit-
ing lower subtlety and detail. A prototype focusing solely
on implementation will necessarily delve deeper into details
than one exploring both implementation and role. Design-
ers prototype distinct issues in parallel to streamline intri-
cate resolutions within their designs and accumulate tacit
knowledge about micro scale aspects long before finalising
the design. This outlook might offer enhanced flexibility
when comparing two prototypes of the same type, such
as two implementation prototypes with comparable micro
scale details. In contrast, the macro, meso, and micro scales
of an integrated prototype might be more fittingly analo-
gous to role, implementation, and look and feel. Indeed,
Houde and Hill emphasise that prototypes convey different
information to various design stakeholders at distinct stages
of the design process, generating potential ambiguities and
challenges.
Recalling Waiswisz’s Hands instrument, tracing the level
of detail over time might, from a distance, resemble a smooth
line transitioning from macro to micro. Nonetheless, closer
inspection would likely reveal fluctuating oscillations among
different levels of detail, each conveying a unique narrative.
In reality, there is no prescribed level of detail for an initial
prototype, nor are there rules dictating the level of detail a
specific prototype should exhibit at any given stage of the
design process. These factors depend on the designer’s re-
quirements and the design space’s shape at any point in the
process. Moving beyond an idealised concept, the idea of
a progression from macro to micro is likely only applicable
to designs created “from scratch.” In practice, designs can
begin and end at any scale, and may not necessarily have a
definitive conclusion.
6.3 Heterarchical DMI Design Spaces
Although we have previously implied a hierarchical view
of the ontology, in this section, we explore it from a het-
erarchical perspective. Magnusson introduces the concepts
of ergomimesis and ergophor [66, 64, 65] to describe the
migratory patterns of musical instruments across cultures
over time [67]. These terms usefully emphasise that, on an
ecological level, instruments with different macro scales bor-
row or imitate meso and micro scale details from each other,
rendering the idea that they suddenly become incomparable
too radical.
Additionally, manufacturers specialising in multiple in-
struments presumably share trade secrets among their prod-
ucts. Moreover, substantial alteration of an instrument’s
micro scale details will inevitably trigger meso or macro
scale changes at some point, particularly when the levels
are tightly coupled, and the instrument’s form or function
is inextricably linked to its most subtle features. Engelbart
encapsulates this concept with his notion of a capability
hierarchy:
A change can propagate up through the capability
hierarchy; higher-order capabilities that can utilize
the initially changed capability can now reorganize
to take special advantage of this change and of the in-
termediate higher-capability changes. A change can
propagate down through the hierarchy as a result of
new capabilities at the high level and modification
possibilities latent in lower levels. [29]
Similarly, Gero’s function-behaviour-structure ontology
of design and design processes [38] also allows for heterar-
chical changes to the design state space through processes
he terms “reformulations,” where any aspect of the design
can instigate a transformation of another. Despite the in-
herently hierarchical nature of the proposed scale-based on-
tology, changes to the hierarchy can occur heterarchically
in practice. Furthermore, with the increasing integration
of artificial intelligence into DMIs [7, 3], we anticipate that
self-modifying or evolving instruments will soon start mak-
ing heterarchical changes semi-autonomously.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have introduced a novel ontology of DMI
design comprising macro, meso, and micro scale details.
This ontology is specifically designed to reveal and isolate
design processes that focus on subtle nuances at the micro
scale. We outlined our empirical efforts to investigate this
domain, which led us to examine the meso and macro scales
more closely, culminating in a critical literature review.
The meso scale is where we identify a considerable amount
of DMI design research, primarily focusing on tools and
frameworks. However, we note that while this domain often
claims to support both micro and macro scale DMI design,
it frequently falls short of achieving either. We intend for
this observation to serve as a call to action for DMI de-
sign technologists to reassess how their tools foster digital
lutherie at the most subtle and intricate levels.
To support this discussion, we also examined various ar-
eas of DMI design where our proposed scale-based ontology
can be either challenged or enhanced. We highlighted po-
tential connections with other concepts, ideas, and method-
ologies, and emphasised that in practice, changes to the
hierarchical ontology can occur heterarchically.
In conclusion, the scale-based ontology presented in this
paper not only facilitates better understanding of the mi-
cro scale nuances in DMI design, but also demonstrates its
potential utility as a robust thinking tool for designers work-
ing in the field. We hope that the insights gleaned from this
exploration can contribute to the development of more effec-
tive design tools, techniques, and frameworks that address
the needs of DMI designers at every level. By scrutinis-
ing and addressing the challenges within the DMI design
landscape, it is our aim to inspire innovation and creativity
while supporting a more comprehensive approach to digital
instrument design in the future.
