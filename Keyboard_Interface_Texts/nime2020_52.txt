ABSTRACT
TorqueTuner is an embedded module that allows Digital
Musical Instrument (DMI) designers to map sensors to pa-
rameters of haptic eﬀects and dynamically modify rotary
force feedback in real-time. We embedded inside Torque-
Tuner a collection of haptic eﬀects (Wall, Magnet, Detents,
Spring, Friction, Spin, Free) and a bi-directional interface
through libmapper, a software library for making connec-
tions between data signals on a shared network. To increase
aﬀordability and portability of force-feedback implementa-
tions in DMI design, we designed our platform to be wire-
less, self-contained and built from commercially available
components. To provide examples of modularity and porta-
bility, we integrated TorqueTuner into a standalone haptic
knob and into an existing DMI, the T-Stick. We imple-
mented 3 musical applications (Pitch wheel, Turntable and
Exciter), by mapping sensors to sound synthesis in audio
programming environment SuperCollider. While the origi-
nal goal was to simulate the haptic feedback associated with
turning a knob, we found that the platform allows for fur-
ther expanding interaction possibilities in application sce-
narios where rotary control is familiar.

1. INTRODUCTION
Haptic feedback is considered an important dimension of
the interaction with musical instruments, as it can facili-
tate a performer-instrument intimacy and lead to a feeling
of embodiment [28]. While this is an inherent mechanical
feature of most acoustic instruments, many researchers have
explored ways of synthesizing the haptic feedback, for digi-
tal musical instruments (DMI) where there is no mechanical
coupling between gesture and sound [14, 17, 19, 12]. In this
paper, we review related work on rotary and self-contained
force-feedback (Section 2). We contribute the implementa-
tion of an open hardware module for rotary haptics with
embedded eﬀects library and bi-directional mapping inter-
face (Section 3). We validate our module with 2 integrations
in DMIs (Section 4) and 3 musical applications (Section 5).
2. RELA TED WORK
We review related work on force feedback interaction, with
a focus on rotary and self-contained haptics.
2.1 Force feedback
Haptic feedback is usually divided into two main categories,
force feedbackand tactile feedback . Force feedback relies
on the kinesthetic sense (position, movement and force on
body limbs), whereas tactile feedback is sensed through
mechanoreceptors in the skin. For acoustic instruments the
haptic feedback is usually inherited directly from the exci-
tation mechanism, and this has been imitated with synthe-
sized force feedback in the design of virtual instrument con-
trollers such as a force feedback keyboard [14] and a virtual
bowed string [19]. Tactile feedback has been used in musi-
cal applications for displaying textures [17], tempo [22] and
vibrations of virtual resonant bodies [12]. Tactile feedback
can be implemented with vibration motors small enough to
ﬁt in a smartphone, but larger and more powerful actuators
are usually needed for force feedback in order to obtain a
suﬃcientz-width, i.e. the range of displayable forces [27].
This increases both mechanical and electrical complexity,
and is likely one explanation of why tactile feedback has
gained the most popularity, in addition to the cost of force
feedback devices remaining high. Examples of research that
seek to accommodate this issue include Verplank’s force
feedback device The Plank [26] constructed from an old
hard drive, Berdahl and Kontogeorgakopoulos’s aﬀordable
and open-source device, Firefader [2] based on linear ac-
tuators, and open-source force feedback developments kits
Hapkit [16] and by Haply [8]. A very common user input
in electronic music is rotary control, usually in the form of
knobs [4], but none of these devices are designed speciﬁcally
for 1-DOF rotary control. Our main goal with TorqueTuner
is to use aﬀordable components and open-source technolo-
gies, to provide powerful rotary force feedback.

2.2 Rotary force feedback
Swindells explored the mechanical and emotional aspects of
interaction with physical rotary controls to inform the de-
sign of a force feedback knob that simulates detents [21].
Chu implemented a collection of haptic eﬀects for such a
device, and explores its application to audio navigation [6].
Their main ﬁnding is how simulated springs can be used
to lock a user input into a center position. Oosterhout et
al. explored the perceptual links between the shape and
the haptic feedback of a knob [25], and expanded their de-
sign into a shape changing knob [24]. Beamish et al. used
rotary force feedback in the design of a DMI, a turntable
for stable velocity playback and a collection of additional
haptic eﬀects including haptic beat markers and scratch-
ing with a spring [1]. Our goal is to use their guidelines in
our design of rotary haptic eﬀects, and extend it by making
them available for DMI designers and artist in a low-cost
and open-source in module.
2.3 Self contained haptics
The control of haptic feedback is usually implemented by
a haptic generator that maps information from sensors and
sound synthesis to actuators [9]. In many existing applica-
tions, the haptic generator is a piece of software running on
a desktop/laptop, that bridges a musical application and a
haptic device. Berdahl and Smith’s Synth-A-Modeller [3]
allows artists to design bi-directional (control in, feedback
out) synthesis applications based on virtual mechanical ob-
jects, and compile it to Faust DSP code, which can be con-
trolled with haptic devices. A similar approach is taken
in Sinclair’s work on Dimple [20], an interactive software
system for developing virtual haptic environments with an
interface through the Open Sound Control (OSC) proto-
col. All though these solutions allow for rendering of com-
plex haptic environments, we ﬁnd that relying on a desk-
top/laptop introduces a limitation on longevity and porta-
bility since compatibility maintenance is required. A main
goal of the design of TorqueTuner is to embed the haptic
rendering on a micro controller, in order to implement a
self contained force feedback module that DMI designers
can easily integrate into new instruments.
3. IMPLEMENT A TION
The implementation of TorqueTuner is threefold: a hard-
ware platform, a collection of haptic eﬀects, and a wireless
mapping interface. In this section we describe aspects of the
implementation important for the goal of a self-contained
rotary force feedback module, and present 2 exemplar inte-
grations of TorqueTuner.
3.1 Hardware design
The hardware platform consists of a servo implemented with
theMechaduino [23] platform, a haptic generator embed-
ded on a ESP32 microcontroller unit (MCU) and a LiPo-
based power-supply (see Figure 2). The Mechaduino han-
dles timing sensitive tasks on an interrupt basis, including
the calculation of velocity, acceleration and the motor con-
trol loop, while the ESP32 handles haptic calculations and
WiFi connectivity. We implement a bi-directional full speed
I2C interface for the internal communication. Additionally,
we implement a checksum algorithm to enable discarding of
erroneous data.
3.1.1 Rotary haptics with Mechaduino servomotor
Mechaduino is an open-source Arduino compatible platform
that implements an industrial servo with a low cost step-
per motor and a hall eﬀect based magnetic encoder. It is
designed for the standardized National Electrical Manufac-
turers Association (NEMA) 17 stepper motor frame-size,
which is commonly used in 3D printers and CNC machines,
and thus commercially available at a low price. The motor
we used for TorqueTuner has a holding torque of 45 Ncm
and a rated current draw of 2A. The Mechaduino platform
utilizes the stepper motor with known step angle in an open
loop conﬁguration, to calibrate the magnetic encoder and
bring the angular resolution down to± 0. 1◦ corresponding
to 3600 PPR.
3.1.2 Embedded control with ESP32
The ESP32 is a system on a chip (SOC) microcontroller
with WiFi and Bluetooth. The ESP32 integrates a 240 MHz
dual core microprocessor with a ﬂoating point unit. The
TinyPico breakout of ESP32 has 4 MB of PSRAM mem-
ory, which makes it capable of storing all the lookup tables
containing the haptic eﬀects.
3.1.3 P ortable power supply
We use a one cell LiPo battery to power the ESP32 and a
boost converter to step up the voltage from 3.7 V to 12 V for
driving the stepper motor. LiPo batteries have become very
common in portable electronics due to their small size and
very high discharge rate. Drawbacks include the necessity
of protecting against over discharging and stabilizing the
voltage output as it drops during discharge. The TinyPico
features a LiPo battery charging circuit that implements
under-voltage protection for the battery and constant volt-
age output. We have included a block diagram of the ﬁnal
hardware setup in Figure 2.

3.2 Embedded haptic effects
We implement the collection of haptic eﬀects as transfer
functions that relate angle or velocity to torque, and store
them as look-up tables on the ESP32. In this way, we can
generalize the control inputs for every haptic eﬀect asscale
(output gain), stretch (input gain) and offset (input oﬀ-
set) of the associated transfer functions. Figure 3 shows the
transfer functions for 4 of the haptic eﬀects. Additionally
we introduce the control inputdamping which deﬁne the
energy dissipation of the system. This can be both neg-
ative and positive, allowing for designingpassive displays ,
where reactive forces (the ones displayed) equal the applied
forces, andactive displays where the displayed forces might
be larger. Positive values corresponds to a damped system,
and negative values corresponds to adding energy. This can
be used to prevent or introduce oscillations respectively. An
overview of the control inputs is given in Table 1.

Figure 3: Transfer functions for angle dependent haptic ef-
fects. The sign of the torque represents the direction, such
that a negative torque is towards a decrease in angle.
A haptic update procedure running a 1 kHz calculates the
controller set points, torque and velocity, based on sensor
data from the servo, control inputs from libmapper and the
chosen haptic eﬀect. The overall data ﬂow of the haptic
update procedure is shown in Figure 4, and the implemen-
tation of haptic eﬀects is explained below.

Colgate et al. deﬁned a virtual wall with stiﬀness and damp-
ing [7] as:

The virtual wall is used as haptic feedback on the range
of the knob by assigningθwall to the desired minimum
and maximum angle, the default values are θmin = 0 ◦ and

3.2.2 Magnet
An exponential increase in torque, as the distance to to a
virtual magnet linearly decreases. A negativeScale input
could be applied to change the polarity of the magnet. The
position of the magnet is by default in the middle, 180◦, as
seen in Figure 3, but could be changed with offset. The ﬂat
(zeroed) area around the magnet position, is implemented
to assure stability.
3.2.3 Detents
Exponentially increasing torque opposing the turning direc-
tion, followed by a transient change in torque direction at
the position of the detent, eﬀectively resulting in a haptic
click. 2 examples are shown in Figure 3 (A and B).
3.2.4 Friction
A linear relation between torque and angular velocity.
Ft = ˙θ ∗ µ (1)
where µ is a friction coeﬃcient. In this mode, the con-
trol input scale maps to µ. The velocity is calculated from
position through backwards diﬀerentiation, and low-pass ﬁl-
tered in order to remove noise.
3.2.5 Spin
A PID controller was hand-tuned while carrying the load
of a custom designed knob, and used to maintain a con-
stant target velocity. In this mode, theScale input sets the
controller eﬀort, which corresponds to the maximum torque
applied to reach target velocity. This is an example of active
feedback.
3.2.6 Free
An unmapped mode in which the Scale parameter con-
trols the torque directly. This allows for freely deﬁning the
haptic behavior through mappings in libmapper, either by
mapping internal parameters (map to itself), to external
controllers (sensors of other DMI’s), to sound related pa-
rameters or to any combination of these. This mode could
also be used for user deﬁned curves.

3.3 Bi-directional mapping interface
We generate a set of output control signals based on the an-
gle estimate obtained from the magnetic encoder. The set
includes ﬁrst and second order derivatives (velocity and ac-
celeration), a virtual angle which can be clipped or wrapped
to a desired range, a quantized angle and a trigger signal.
The two last mentioned are both synchronized to the posi-
tion of detents by default.

3.3.1 Mapping library for embedded platforms
libmapper is a library for making connections between data
signals on a shared network using OSC [11]. The library
is written in C and is supported on macOS, Windows, and
Linux. In order to compile libmapper for ESP32, its de-
pendencies need to be compiled ﬁrst. libmapper has two
dependencies,liblo and zlib. liblo is a lightweight library for
OSC communication. zlib is a library for data compression.
The zlib library has no dependencies, and we could compile
it with no modiﬁcations. liblo relies on POSIX sockets and
POSIX threads (pthreads) for creating TCP/UDP sockets
and servers. The ESP32 platform provides the ESP-IDF
(Espressif IoT Development Framework), which is an API
for developing embedded applications. The ESP-IDF in-
cludes the librarylwip, a lightweight TCP/IP stack. The
API of lwip is made to replicate the behaviour of POSIX
sockets, such that the library can serve as a compatibility
layer for using POSIX sockets on embedded systems. As the
ESP-IDF is based on the FreeRTOS operating system, the
ESP-IDF supports multitasking with threads (calledtasks
in FreeRTOS). Conveniently, ESP-IDF includes a pthread
library that translates the FreeRTOS API into the POSIX
threads API, allowing software that uses pthreads to run
on the ESP32. These abstractions provide most of the im-
plementations needed for the port of libmapper. We con-
tributed two minor but required changes to liblo. First,
in the function which translate incoming data packets into
OSC messages, we uniﬁed the memory allocation implemen-
tations between desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux) and
embedded (ESP32) platforms that return diﬀerent pointers
values. Second, libmapper relies on loop-back of multicast
messages i.e. sending all outgoing messages to itself, for
assigning a correct device ID. We speciﬁcally enabled the
socket optionIP_MULTICAST_LOOP for ESP32, which is en-
abled by default on macOS and Linux.
To facilitate the use of libmapper for embedded platforms,
we chose to port libmapper from an ESP-IDF project into
an Arduino library. Arduino libraries are distributed as
source and header ﬁles along with a text ﬁle containing
metadata for the library. This means that the library is
compiled together with the user’s project, every time the
user presses the ” Compile” button in the Arduino IDE. As
there are quite a few compiler variables that need to be set
up correctly for libmapper to compile, using this approach
would require a lot of changes to the libmapper source code.
According to theArduino IDE 1.5: Library speciﬁcation ,
a library can alternatively be distributed as precompiled.
This has the beneﬁt that a Makeﬁle can be written to gen-
erate the Arduino library as a collection of header ﬁles and a
precompiled archive (.a) ﬁle. Another beneﬁt is that it will
speed up the compilation time for the user, as the library
would already be compiled. For these reasons, this was the
chosen approach for distributing the library. The libmapper
Arduino library and all TorqueTuner related source code are
available athttps://github.com/IDMIL/TorqueTuner.
4. MODULAR INTEGRA TIONS IN DMIS
We produced two exemplar integrations of our TorqueTuner
module, (1) a standalone knob and (2) an integration with
an existing DMI, the T-stick. These are presented in Fig-
ure 5.
4.1 Standalone haptic knob
To create a standalone knob module, we 3d printed a knob
and a mounting enclosure with a tilted front-panel. We
used it for the design of the haptic eﬀects, by making in-
ternal mappings in thefree mode. We propose this as a
platform for DMI designers to prototype rotary force feed-
back for new instruments. This is our rotary equivalent
of the “Hello Wall” starter example of haptics tutorials in
planar spaces [8]. We believe that our open-source and cost-
eﬀective integration will allow hapticians to easily replicate
results from related research works on force-feedback rotary
haptics [1, 21, 24, 25].
4.2 Rotary joint between 2 T -Sticks
The T-Stick is a DMI developed at Input Devices and Mu-
sic Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL) 10 years ago, that has
been continuously extended and maintained ever since. It
is a stick build from PVC tube, and it includes pressure
sensing, capacitive sensing, 6 axis position and movement
sensing and triggering with a piezo mic. It uses a ESP32
internally for sensor acquisition and transmission of sensor
data over a network, and is thereby libmapper compatible
[13]. There is some inherent force feedback when playing the
IMU of the T-stick with impulsive gestures such as shaking
or swinging, as its mass poses a resistance against acceler-
ation, but for slow changes in the orientation of the instru-
ment, the performer relies mainly on visual feedback. As
an example of portability of TorqueTuner, we designed an
adapter for adding rotary force feedback, and a new twist-
ing gesture, to the T-Stick. Figure 5b shows the 3D printed
T-Stick adapter, and 2 T-sticks. I works like a force feed-
back joint between 2 T-sticks, one mounted on each end.
See Figure 1. We ﬁnd theSpring mode particularly useful
in conveying feedback on the orientation of the instrument,
speciﬁcally forroll.

5. MUSICAL APPLICA TIONS
We present 3 example applications mapping TorqueTuner
haptics to sound synthesis. We developed an extension
MapperUGenadding libmapper support to audio program-
ming environment SuperCollider.
5.1 T urntable
We designed a turntable-like application, where playback
can be stopped by stalling the motor, and scratching can
be performed by twisting it back and forth. A DC signal is
mapped to inputTarget Velocity, in Spin mode, such that
the motor rotates at constant speed. The output Velocity,
is mapped to the playback speed of drum loop. The closed
loop velocity controller tries to maintain the target velocity
at all times, and therefore a torque is displayed when the
user slows or stalls the motor. In [10] an energy continuum
is discussed, i.e. the importance of a direct link between
sound intensity and user energy input. In this mapping, an
energy continuum is preserved, but the link is reversed, as
energy is required from the user to silence the sound.
5.2 Pitch wheel
We designed an application reminiscent of the pitch wheel
common in many keyboard synthesizers. When twisting,
TorqueTuner displays an exponentially increasing force, when
released it returns to idle. When using TorqueTuner in the
Spring mode, there is a natural idle state, where the virtual
spring is in equilibrium (neither compressed or stretched),
corresponding to 180◦ on Figure 3D. In this mode, a saw
wave is passed through a resonant low-pass ﬁlter, and the
cutoﬀ frequency is mapped to the angle. The exponential
torque/angle relation serves as continuous feedback on the
parameter state, and allows for accurate tuning of the cut-
oﬀ frequency. This is reminiscent of the theremin + elastic
band experiment in[15]. A second controller, acceleration
data from the T-Stick, is mapped toScale, allowing a shak-
ing gesture on the T-Stick to be reﬂected as oscillations in
torque. This causes small changes in the angle, and results
in accurate control of vibrato-like modulation, which would
be diﬃcult with the T-Stick alone.
5.3 String plucker
We designed the string plucker application where detents
serve as haptic feedback on virtual string plucking, and
where twisting in-between detents produce vibrato-like mod-
ulation. InSharp Detent mode, the Trigger output is
mapped to the excitation input of a Karplus-Strong based
plucked string model. TheAngle output is mapped to
the length of a delay-line, eﬀectively changing the pitch
of the plucked string. This mapping was explored when
mounted to the T-stick, and the output of the pressure
sensor was mapped toStretch, such that detent density
could be controlled by squeezing the T-Stick. A demon-
stration video of the 3 applications is available at:https:
//vimeo.com/404592134
6. DISCUSSION
An interview-based analysis on the challenges of haptic de-
sign is given in [18], and one ﬁnding is that hapticians ﬁnd
the implementation of demos/prototypes costly and com-
plex but crucial in haptic experience design (HaXD). We
believe that TorqueTuner, being self contained and cost ef-
fective, has potential of accommodating this issue. We also
believe that having a wireless interface to common music
software can assist also DMI’s designers and artists in do-
ing HaXD which is otherwise the work of hapticians, and
therefore see a great potential in integrating libmapper into
more music software. The appeal of TorqueTuner as a pro-
totyping device for artists and non-programmers could be
further enhanced with the implementation of a GUI for free
hand curve editing, allowing for designing haptic eﬀects,
storing them as lookup tables and previewing them in real-
time. We are currently working on implementing the stan-
dalone haptic knob, as a rotary force feedback block for
Probatio, a modular toolkit for rapid prototyping postures
and sensor combinations for DMI’s. [5] The LiPo battery
solution contributes to the modular and portable quality
of TorqueTuner, and enables free endless rotation of both
the motor-shaft and the body of TorqueTuner, as would
not be possible with a wired power solution. While this
eased the integration with the T-stick, and hopefully other
future DMI’s, it poses great limitations in terms of capac-
ity and life-time. In power hungry applications such as the
turntable, a fresh battery was discharged in 15 minutes. We
suggest that future work focus on 1) optimizing for power
losses in TorqueTuner and 2) limit the scope of haptic eﬀects
with power consumption in mind. We suggest a possible so-
lution to 1) be the introduction a passivity observer, like the
capacitive touch sensing in [2], that allows for disabling the
actuator when there is no user interaction.

7. CONCLUSION
In this paper we described TorqueTuner, a self contained
rotary force feedback module with an embedded collection
of haptic eﬀects. With the motivation of assisting DMI de-
signers in prototyping force-feedback instruments, we built
TorqueTuner from aﬀordable components and open-source
technologies, and designed a generalized and wireless con-
trol interface exposed via libmapper. We implemented a
LiPo battery solution to make the module completely wire-
less, and thereby easy to integrate into existing DMI’s. We
produced 2 exemplar integrations that demonstrate the porta-
bility of the module, and made 3 musical applications by
mapping the TorqueTuner to sound synthesis in SuperCol-
lider. Wireless power and communication posed issues of
capacity and life-time that limits the scope of displayable
haptic eﬀects. Optimizations on power loss should be ex-
plored in the future.
