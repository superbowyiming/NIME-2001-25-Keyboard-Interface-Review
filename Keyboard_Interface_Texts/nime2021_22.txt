Abstract
The praxis of using detailed visual models to illustrate complex ideas is widely used in 
the sciences but less so in music theory. Taking the composer’s notes as a starting 
point, we have developed a complete interactive 3D model of Grisey’s Talea (1986). 
Our model presents a novel approach to music education and theory by making 
understanding of complex musical structures accessible to students and non-
musicians, particularly those who struggle with traditional means of learning or whose 
mode of learning is predominantly visual. The model builds on the foundations of 1) the 
historical associations between visual and musical arts and those concerning 
spectralists in particular 2) evidence of recurring cross-modal associations in the 
general population and consistent associations for individual synesthetes. Research 
into educational uses of the model is a topic for future exploration.

Introduction
Gérard Grisey, a prominent 20th century French composer, was one of the founders of 
spectralism. Beyond its technical aspects, which involve using Fourier analysis of 
harmonic spectra1 as a tool for creating timbre and harmony, the term spectralism 
carries philosophical implications in its emphasis on perception as central to music 
analysis. Like their impressionist predecessors, spectralists were inspired by visual 
metaphors [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].
This project contributes to current audio-visual mapping efforts by presenting a 
complete 3D model of Grisey’s Talea (1986). When designing this model, we began 
with the composer's stated intentions. The analytical framework draws on the 
composer’s notes in the score preface and Baillet’s analysis[6]. The visual 
representations draw on research examining associations between different auditory

and visual parameters as well as phenomenological traditions of music analysis related 
to the composer’s writings on musical perception[7].
We chose to use web technology to implement the project with the goal that it would 
not be geographically limited but instead accessible to anybody with a computer and 
an Internet connection. The international collaborative nature of the project also 
contributed to this decision.
Project Background
Relationship to current research
To our knowledge, a comprehensive system of audio-visual mappings has yet to be 
developed. Many studies suffer from drawbacks such as small sample sizes, 
demographically skewed participation, and difficulty separating different components 
of sound and image in meaningful ways. Nevertheless, some associations appear 
consistent enough to be of significance. Giannakis makes a distinction between 
‘arbitrary’ and ‘empirical’ modes of translation[8] and emphasizes the difficulty of 
establishing a common research methodology leading to empirically supported 
approaches due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field[9]. Researchers generally 
find it useful to distinguish between physical and perceptual frames of reference[10]. 
In a 2006 essay, Giannakis presents an overview of research in the field of audio-visual 
mappings for sound visualizations[9]. A summary of more recent research can be 
found in Sun, Xiuwen et al[11]. 
Giannakis divides research in the field into three main categories: graphic sound 
synthesis, color spaces for sound2 [12], and synesthesia and cross-modal associations3.
A general cross-modal association exists between aspects of sharpness (defined as 
fundamental frequency) and spatial height[13]. This correlation has been codified 
into standard notation practices, as well as musical mapping methods. Through his 
empirical investigations, Giannakis found general associations between the visual 
dimensions of brightness and saturation and the auditory dimensions of pitch and 
loudness, as well as associations between the visual dimensions of texture and the 
auditory dimensions of timbre4. Likewise, Sun, Xiuwen et al have found through their 
research that pitch, tempo, roughness and sharpness are associated with hue and 
brightness, replicating and expanding existing findings5. Sun, Xiuwen et al further 
conclude from their studies that certain cross-modal pairings elicit shorter response 
times to cognitive tasks than others6. Through their studies, Disley, Howard et al have

attempted to map commonly used associations between timbral qualities of musical 
instruments and various descriptive terms among musicians (2006)[14]. 
Synesthesia is a distinct aspect of cross-modal association characterized by being 
consistent in the individual but inconsistent across different populations, with ‘colored 
hearing’ being one of the most common forms. Giannakis summarizes synesthesia 
research as showing associations between pitch class and color hue and between 
pitch height and color lightness7. Hue and pitch are determined by light- and 
sound frequencies respectively.
History of audio-visual synthesis
Audio-visual synthesis has a long history. Impressionism in music, which arguably 
constitutes a precursor to spectralism, had deep ties to the visual arts, and spectralism 
descends from that tradition[15]. In this way, Malherbe links Grisey and Murail to 
Seurat8[16].
Scriabin is considered a pioneer among serious composers, with Prometheus[17] being 
a prominent example. He also invented a ‘keyboard of light’[13]. In the mid-20th 
century, composers like Feldman, E. Brown, Cage[18], and Cardew were part of a 
generation championing the idea of graphic or multisensory scores[19]. Many of these 
composers had a strong interest in philosophy and the esoteric in common.
Clifton[20] and Ihde[21] paved the way for relating audio-visual mapping to 
phenomenology in their approaches to music analysis. In the 1970’s, Thompson 
created Soundpainting, a musical sign-language which facilitates structured group 
improvisations[22]. 
In the field of computer music, Xenakis’ UPIC (1992) allows users to draw and 
manipulate waveforms9. Giannakis’ Sound Mosaics (2001) is a prototype user interface 
for sound synthesis based on direct manipulation of visual representations, based on 
audio-visual mapping techniques supported by empirically demonstrated 
correlations10. More recently, Tymoczko has developed a model mapping musical 
chords onto a geometric space[23].
Wenk-Wolff[24] and McCracken[25] create video-art and paintings respectively, based 
on their experience of music as synesthetes.

environment. The project is based on apps pairing parameters of music theory with 
scientific phenomena[26].  
About Talea
Talea or The machine and the rank weeds (1986), or Talea in short, is scored for 
flute11, clarinet in B-flat12, violin, cello, and piano.
In Talea, an initial idea is gradually transformed, or ‘cut’, throughout the piece13. The 
composer tackles two aspects of musical discourse: speed and contrast. He writes that 
the two linked parts of the piece (Part 1 and Part 2) represent ‘two auditory angles 
of a single phenomenon’, based on a ‘single gesture (fast, fortissimo, ascending - 
slow, pianissimo, descending)’ Further, the formal process of the second part of the 
form is described as creating a ‘sort of spiral’[27]. 
Analysis
Part 1
The piece consists of two contrasting parts, Part 1 and Part 2, linked together by a 
bridge. At the core of the formal structure are two elements—a and b—representing 
contrast on the most basic level. Element a is characterized by loud dynamics and fast 
rhythm, while element b is characterized by soft dynamics and slow rhythm.
Other elements are developed from elements a and b: elements a’, a’’, b’ and 
b’’14. Together with elements s and t, which represent silence and interrupted silence 
respectively, these elements combine into phases, which represent the “single gesture”.
The formal process of Part 1 resembles the workings of a machine consisting of a 
layering of phases assigned to five individual voices, each played mainly by one 
instrument15. More voices are consecutively added, resulting in increased 
polyphonic complexity. Element a increases in prominence relative to element b, 
resulting in increased dynamic activity. Each consecutive phase is shortened 
resulting in the compression of musical time. Contrasts are gradually blurred and 
leveled off due the approximation in the duration of a and b elements (and their varied 
forms) and the number of voices out of phase with each other.

All notes in Part 1 belong to the overtone spectrum of the fundamental c16. The pitch 
material is processed through two ‘imaginary bandpass filters’: The ‘range filter’ 
causes the pitch range to gradually expand from the middle of the overtone series 
towards the entire spectrum (increased broadness). The ‘microtonal filter’ is applied 
to the microtones in between partials, gradually eliminating them (decreased 
broadness).
The ‘rank weeds’ are melodic figures representing wild, spontaneous growth. 
Premonitions of these are increasingly present towards the end of Part 1.

Transition (bridge):
The transition executes the shift from a polyphonic to a monophonic structure, as the 
observer is moving from one vantage point to another. This is achieved through a 
process of unification of the elements of pitch and rhythm.
Part 2
In Part 2, the element structure of individual voice phases in Part 1 becomes the 
macroscopic formal design. This is directly related to the dissolution of polyphony, 
since the order of voice entries made up the macroscopic formal design in Part 117. 
The formal design of Part 2 resembles that of Part 118. A new formal element is 
appended to every other repetition of the cycle, resulting in a gradual increase in 
phase length.

Where Part 1 was based on the overtones of a single pitch class (‘c’), Part 2 contains a 
spectrum of the harmonics on chromatically descending fundamentals. The 
completion of this descent, together with the reduction of element A to a single pitch 
class causes Part 2 (and the piece) to end.
Two ‘imaginary tools’ have a similar function to the filters in Part 1: 
The ‘microscope’ permits stretching of the tempo and penetration into the 
microphonics, increasing perception of detail. The ‘frequency shifter’ adds the same 
number (Hz) to each frequency of the spectrum over a given fundamental, distorting it.
In Part 2, the prominence of elements A and B diverges towards an extreme difference. 
The tempi of the A sections remain constant and those of the B sections become 
increasingly slower. The form thus evolves towards an expansion of musical time. 
As the sections based on element B increase in length, more and more partials and 
non-harmonic sounds are added to their spectra, while A elements are gradually cut

down from cluster chords to containing only a single pitch class. This results in 
increased dissonance.
In a similar manner to the way the B sections invade the domain of the A sections, the 
‘rank weeds’ invade and overtake the B sections as the form progresses, dominating 
the soundscape completely at the end of the piece.

Basis in the composer’s intentions
When developing the form of the 3D model, we began with the composer's stated 
intention to tackle two aspects of musical discourse: speed and contrast (see above). 
The spiral represents the formal development that ‘drives’ the process of the piece 
(like an engine) and thus the ‘speed’ aspect. The cylinder represents the two parts of 
the piece, displayed as ‘contrast’. The form of the cylinder was a more intuitive choice 
than the spiral but was chosen to accommodate both the idea of a machine with an 
engine and to provide a form within which the spiral can be nested.
A previous draft version is described in Andersen’s 2015 TEDxSBU talk Talea—Music 
frozen in Space19.
Novel contribution of our model
In the context of the field of audio-visual mapping, our model presents a novel 
contribution through representing a complete 3D interpretation of a piece of music, 
mapping musical structures onto visual counterparts. Our model goes beyond a simple

visual score through visualizing the musical processes the composer used as part of his 
formal design and through allowing the user to interactively explore significant 
features of the piece. 
Method of interpretation
Inspired by Clifton’s phenomenology, the original illustrations were intuitive in nature. 
We have been drawing on Andersen’s experience as a synesthete when developing 
these ideas. However, our current model also incorporates more commonly found cross-
modal associations for which there is partial empirical evidence. We have made direct 
‘translations’ between different dimensions, most often the dimensions of (musical) 
time and (physical) space, in order to maintain similar architectural proportions. Some 
decisions have been made arbitrarily in order to accommodate other large-scale 
considerations. 
Specifics
Aspects of contrast: the cylinder
The cylinder represents aspects of contrast through complementary or contrasting 
qualities for Part 1 and Part 2 respectively. The proportions of the cylinder itself are 
adjusted in order to accommodate the spiral and do not represent musical proportions.

Chronological direction: clockwise. The surface can be read as a visual score, 
starting at the center and moving towards the periphery. 
Background color: Bright yellow (parameter: emissiveness20[28]). Represents a loud, 
active texture and the single fundamental C and its partials, which is the harmonic 
foundation for Part 1. The color yellow represents the pitch class ‘c’  synesthetically to 
Andersen. 
Five colored strands: representing the five voices of a polyphonic texture. Colors 
chosen in the model: Blue/purple for Voice 1 (piano), red for Voice 2 (cello), orange for 
Voice 3 (clarinet), green for Voice 4 (violin), light blue for Voice 5 (flute)21.
Two considerations have been applied to color selection: Timbral qualities of the 
instruments: intuitive perception of the strings as ‘warm’ (warm colors) and the 
winds and piano as ‘cold’ (cold colors) in the context of the piece. Context within 
whole: The five voices become the ten harmonic fundamentals of Part 2. Therefore 
they need to fit into the overall color spectrum of Part 2 (see below). The two 
background colors (yellow and magenta) have been avoided for the sake of visibility. 
Imaginary tools22: 
The increasing ‘bandwidth’ of the colored strands represents the ‘range filter’: 
development over time in the melodic ranges of each voice is represented in the 
movement of the lines, with pitch height ascending from the center towards the 
periphery. 
The grid represents the ‘microtonal filter’: development from full microtonal 
spectrum towards a limited number of partials is represented through an increasingly 
wide-masked web. Associating sounding pitches with colored matter and empty pitch 
space with empty color space, we have imagined the respective domains of pitch range 
and the physical circle as surfaces which can be “filled” by material to varying degrees 
of density23. 
View of inside/opposite side: The spiral is nested inside the cylinder. The opposite 
(contrasting) side of the object can be discerned in the background of the perceptual 
field.

Part 2: Cylinder back
Chronological direction: top to bottom
Background color: magenta24. The color was chosen as the opposite of Part 1 (yellow 
in the additive color system) to maximize contrast, suggesting a more static texture 
and lesser amplitude (softer dynamics). 
Ten colored strands: represent the chromatically descending fundamentals of a 
monophonic texture. The fundamentals are represented by a color spectrum from 
blue/purple to dark blue25. The selection was made arbitrarily in order to 
accommodate the overall idea of associating the color spectrum with the harmonic 
spectrum 26. Line thickness approximates the relative duration of each successive 
section, following an analogy between duration in musical time and the amount of two-
dimensional space occupied on the surface.
Imaginary tools: 
‘Microscope’: The gradual expansion and changes in texture of the ten horizontal 
stripes symbolizes ‘zooming in’ on the melodic material. 
‘Frequency shifter’: Addition of horizontal lines represent an increasingly distorted 
harmony.

Chronological direction: left to right
Background color: Bright yellow gradually becomes magenta. Represents the shift 
from a loud and active to quiet and static texture. 
The five voices of Part 1 branch out and become the ten harmonic fundamentals of 
Part 2. This represents a structural shift from a polyphonic/monoharmonic to a 
monophonic/polyharmonic texture.
Weed-like designs in the surface structure represent the ‘rank weeds’27. The 
development in density (increasing from beginning to end of the piece) has been 
portrayed in an approximate chronological manner.

Aspects of speed: the spiral
The spiral represents aspects of speed. Formal speed (the frequency of transitions 
between formal elements) is represented by the length of each formal unit. Rhythmic 
speed (predominance of element a/A relative to b/B) is represented by the level of 
saturation of the texture. The relationships in length between the different sections of 
the spiral are a direct translation of their durational relationship in musical time. 
Colors chosen match those of the cylinder texture (see above). Dark (highly 
saturated) shades represent loud, active elements (elements a/A and variations). 
Lighter (less saturated) shades represent soft, static elements (elements b/B and 
variations). Transparent areas represent silence (element S), and black areas 
represent ‘rank weeds’28.

Fractured elements represent the dissolution of the five voices. Semi-transparent 
elements represent a thinning of the texture towards a single interval (tritone). Solid 
elements represent the merging of individual voices and textures into a single 
monophonic texture.
System Overview 
Kwan chose to generate the three-dimensional model using the Three.js JavaScript 
library29. To generate the two-dimensional textures for the models, Kwan used the 
JavaScript library p5.js30 and used its original Java-based counterpart Processing31 
when he felt that performance gains were possible. Playback of audio corresponding to 
model features was made possible through Vimeo’s Player API32. 
Data Processing
Several options for data transcription were considered, including spectral analysis and 
OCR-based score transcription. We found spectral analysis unfeasible given the 
polyphonic nature of available recordings. Attempts at OCR-based score transcription 
using Audiveris33 proved unreliable given the handwritten nature of the available 
score and the extensive use of non-standard notation. Therefore we ultimately decided 
to extract data manually based on Baillet’s analysis34. Range data was extracted 
directly from the score.
We transcribed Baillet’s analysis into spreadsheets and hand-converted it into CSV 
format to be easily parsed. As we were using JavaScript to generate the 3D models and 
wanted a more structured data format to work with, we used Python scripts to convert 
the CSV files to JSON.

Textures (cylinder)
The texture for the front (Part 1) end of the cylinder was generated in p5js. Due to the 
computational cost of diffusion-limited aggregation (code adapted from [29]) to 
emulate the ‘rank weeds’, textures for the cylinder side and the back (Part 2) end 
were generated in Processing.
The texture for the Part 1 end of the cylinder consists of the part’s five voices 
represented by overlapping Archimedean spirals[30] with polar equation r = aθ1/n ( n 
= 0.125, a = 910) and the same colorings as the three-dimensional spirals and an 
underlying gray grid against a yellow background.
‘Range filter’: Each spiral is displaced radially from its usual contour by its respective 
voice’s simplified pitch contour. The pitch contours of each spiral are simplified by 
comparing the highest and lowest pitches of each element to a central pitch (Eb4) and 
if a range’s overall contour is ascending or descending. If the contour of an element is 
descending, the radius of the spiral contracts to the displacement from Eb4 of the 
lowest pitch and expands to the displacement of the highest pitch if ascending. 
Elements with a flat contour as well as s and t elements retain the radial displacement 
of the simplified end of the previous element. Additionally, s and t elements are drawn 
with thinner stroke weight and a semi-transparent fill.
‘Microtonal filter’: The gray grid is drawn with ten lines extending outward from the 
center of the texture and dividing the image equally. An Archimedian spiral with n = 
0.25 and a = 2730 defines the other axis of the “grid”. These parameters were chosen 
according to aesthetic considerations.
The texture for the back (Part 2) end of the cylinder consists of ten horizontal stripes 
representing the ten successive harmonic fundamentals in increasing thickness 
against the magenta background. Overlaid over the stripes is a root-like structure 
representing the ‘rank weeds’. 
‘Microscope’: Symbolizing a “zooming in” on the melodic material, the ten horizontal 
stripes grow thicker, blurrier, and more transparent towards the bottom of the texture. 
To achieve this, each horizontal stripe is made up of an increasing number of one-pixel 
wide lines that stretch across the width of the texture and are increasingly transparent 
(with random offsets in opacity). 
‘Frequency shifter’: To represent the simultaneous process of increasingly distorted 
harmony, an increasing number of horizontal lines are added over the main stripes. 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Grisey’s 'Talea': Musical Representation As An Interactive 3D Map
17
These pixel-width lines do not extend across the width of the texture but instead have 
their endpoints in increasing distances from the texture’s center. Additionally, these 
lines are shaded with increasingly distinct colors from the main stripe.
The texture for the side of the cylinder connects the elements of each cylinder end’s 
texture. Part 1’s yellow background and Part 2’s magenta background are connected in 
the side texture by a background gradient fading between the two colors. ‘Rank 
weeds’ are also present in this texture (but do not connect to Part 2’s rank weeds) 
follow an opposite coloring scheme to the background (a yellow to magenta gradient) 
and are overlaid over all other elements of the side texture. The spirals which 
converge at the top of Part 1’s texture split off into twenty Bézier curves that connect 
to the left and right ends of Part 2’s ten horizontal stripes.
Spirals
The rotating spirals that represent Parts 1 and 2 are conical spirals with the 
parametric equations x = t r cos (a t), y = t r sin (a t), z = t with a = 201 [31]. Part 1 
consists of five nested spirals for each of the voices with r = 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2. Part 
2 consists of one spiral with r = 1.0. The length of each spiral is multiplied by a 
constant value (variablelenMult in the code) to adjust their lengths to aesthetic taste 
and visual clarity.
As Part 2 has multiple changes in tempi, sections of its spiral need to be scaled in 
order to reflect their proper temporal scale relations. Using Part 1’s durations in 80 
bpm as a baseline, a pre-processing step on Part 2’s data is executed upon loading the 
3D model that scales Part 2’s durations in relation to Part 1.
Each of the nested spirals for Part 1 represent an individual voice and spiral inward 
towards a central point. Each voice is represented by a color (see above). Each type of 
element for each voice is represented by a colored length of the voice’s spiral and its 
particular coloring is based on the spiral’s chosen color. a elements are of the 
brightest, fullest shade of the chosen color,  b elements are fainter than a elements and 
with significantly more white, a elements have a bit more black than a’ elements, b’ 
elements have a bit more black than b elements and a’’ elements and b’’ elements tend 
even more towards black than their A’ and B’ counterparts. All a and b elements 
(including their derivatives a’, a’’, b’, and b’’) are of full opacity, reflectivity, and 
shininess. s elements are of an off-white color (regardless of spiral color) and have 
20% opacity. t elements are of a dark-gray color (regardless of spiral color) and have 
20% shininess, 25% reflectivity, and 65% opacity. s and t element qualities were

18
determined by aesthetic taste. The Part 2 spiral follows a similar method to Part 1, 
except with the colors representing successive harmonic fundamentals following each 
other sequentially as part of one spiral and additional colors chosen to lie in between 
the original five colors. 
The coloring of each element’s section of a spiral was achieved through creating a 
material for each individual element and assigning the material to the vertices of a 
spiral’s mesh. As the previous stated parametric equations calculate a spiral 
progressing outward with increasing values of t, calculating and assigning the vertices 
for Part 1’s spiral had to occur backwards as the spiral progresses inwards as it maps 
Part 1’s development.
In between the spirals representing Talea’s two main sections, Talea’s bridge section 
is represented by a twisting cylinder of colors blending and fading into transparency 
and transforming into blue. Except for the first stage of the bridge (where no transition 
occurs yet), each step of this transition is represented by a slice of the whole cylinder 
(in reality, each slice is its own cylinder mesh) and each slice has its own unique 
material. The sequence of textures for the bridge’s transforming process were 
generated in Processing and consist of five initially-distinct stripes for each of Part 1’s 
voices progressively fading more and more into each other in a gradient. In the 
interest of not having too many texture images, this process of distinction moving into 
gradation was calculated in nine steps, resulting in nine images.
At the end nearest the end of Part 1’s spiral, the cylinder is textured with the image of 
the five stripes at their most distinct repeated once on the cylinder. To gradually blend 
the colors together, successive cylinder slices are textured with images further along 
in the gradient sequence and the images increasingly repeat in a texture, resulting in 
cylinders textured with ten stripes, fifteen stripes, twenty stripes and so on. Once the 
bridge cylinder enters its fading-into-transparency stage, the increase in the number of 
repeats stops and the opacity decreases in successive slices to 0%. From this point, 
each successive slice is textured blue and the opacity is increased back to 100% in 
successive slices. To highlight the blending of colors and transition to transparent, the 
beginning of the bridge cylinder and the slices leading up to the transition to 0% 
opacity are rotated at successively increasing speeds.
Due to the less-than-straightforward mapping between a spiral’s duration scaling and 
the space the spiral occupies in the Z-dimension, the length of the bridge was chosen 
by intuition. Future improvements to the model will include a mathematical derivation 
of this quantity to improve scale accuracy.

Navigating the Model
Navigation through the model is made possible through Three.js’s Orbit Control 
library. It allows mouse and keyboard control to zoom in and out of the model, enabling 
the user to see both inside and outside the cylinder. It also allows the user to rotate the 
model and shift the viewpoint. Through event listeners and Three.js’s Raycaster, the 
user can mouse over structures in the model to get details about its individual 
elements in a text overlay. Through clicking on a text overlay’s title or pressing the 
space bar, the user can get further details about the model on a separate web page. 
Instructions on how to navigate the model are provided on the project’s landing page.
Animation
Animation is taken care of by a render() function that is called initially on startup and 
later by JavaScript’s requestAnimationFrame() function which is run on screen 
repainting. In addition to updating the scene’s camera through Orbit Controls and 
rendering the scene, render() calls the function animate().
The animate() function uses Three.js’s Raycaster to determine what information to 
populate the text overlay with. Additionally, the function is responsible for adding a 
defined constant rotAmt (chosen to fit aesthetic sensibilities) to Spiral 1’s Z-rotation 
and subtracting the same amount from Spiral 2’s Z-rotation. This causes Spiral 1 to 
rotate counterclockwise and Spiral 2 to rotate clockwise at the same rate. The 
animate() function is also responsible for the bridge cylinder’s aforementioned rotation 
with increasing speeds of rotation in successive slices.
Conclusions
The purpose of our model is contributing to improved access to understanding complex 
musical form. “Learning to play—playing to learn”35 in this context means taking an 
active and intuitive approach to learning through playful interaction rather than 
traditional analysis.
The model particularly addresses the challenges faced by students and audiences 
whose mode of learning is predominantly visual in today’s academic environment. The 
model is inspired from perceived phenomena such as synesthesia and structural 
proportion and therefore conceived independently from any one system of notation as 
a method for analysis (in particular, Western conceptions of musical notation). This 
independence, along with its Internet-based nature, lends itself to a wider audience 
beyond traditional 21st century Western art music audiences.

The current version would be suitable for a graduate-level course in 20th- and 21st 
century western art music. With a few alterations in the descriptions, it would be 
suitable for lectures for the general public and other types of learning environments as 
well. We believe similar concepts could also be applied in interactive environments 
aimed at children. 
We intend to base future versions on continued evolution in current research, 
particularly research concerning cross-modal association as a tool for improving 
learning. Ultimately, we hope to present the model in a physically-interactive acoustic 
space36
Following publication, we hope to receive practical feedback from diverse audiences 
representing educational settings of all levels. This will inform future project 
developments.

2.  Color spaces are models attempting to represent aspects of color in a dimensional 
space. Caivano and others have used these models to facilitate audio-visual mapping 
by assigning each color dimension to a corresponding sound dimension. These 
associations are typically based on physical similarities or arbitrary. See Giannakis

“As with the effects of the neo-impressionists’ optical mixing, which virtually 
constructs a scale of colours which are not actually present on the canvas, the 
effects caused by spectral fusion allow coherent timbres to be heard where, on 
paper, only aggregates of distinct elements are notated” (Malherbe p 17)

13.  Talea means ‘cutting’ in Latin. The term Talea “designates a reiterated rhythmic 
pattern to which a configuration of pitches called "color"...is grafted”  ↩
14.  Since the features of these variations are only represented broadly in the model, 
a more complete discussion is outside of the scope of this paper. ↩
15.  Voice 1 is mainly assigned to the piano, Voice 2 to the cello, Voice 3 to the 
clarinet, Voice 4 to the violin and Voice 5 to the flute. In the beginning of the piece, 
other instruments double the first voices before separating into their own voice, 
creating a process of fission: All instruments double the piano (Voice 1) in the 
beginning of the piece, the violin doubles the cello (Voice 2) etc. ↩
16.  Untempered notes are assigned to instruments other than the piano ↩

26.  Both encompass a frequency range. However, there is no relationship between 
the relative frequency of each individual pitch and color. ↩
27.  For practical reasons, the rank weeds occurring in Part 1 have only been 
represented on the cylinder side and not the cylinder front. ↩
