Abstract
This paper concerns magnetic tape and the nostalgia of media,
finding new relevance in old technology, remaking and adapting
practices to fit within a modern workflow. Pushing against the
driving force of economic structures, which emphasises a contin-
uous cycle of replacement, musicians and instrument designers
are drawing on a shared history to create new pieces of art and
machines. This can be read as reflecting NIME’s Code of Practice
and, more generally, the unfolding climate crisis.
For some, NIME may convey a focus on new musical instru-
ments, but here, we focus on the notion of new through the
diffracted lens of the old. Defined in recent NIME conferences
by zooming in on the ‘O’ in NIME through the importance of
reusing and repurposing old musical instruments and, in our case,
old practices and processes. This paper considers magnetic tape
and the machines that process it as the material and instrument.
Following a survey, we present a diffracted reading through
an intra-related process of how musicians, producers, and others
who work with audio integrate tape into their practice. Drawing
on post-humanist theories, we explore how slowness, community,
and the old can inform NIME as a methodology. It provides insight
for NIME to continue moving forward while focusing, through
its Code of Practice, on sustainability, connection with our past,
our history, years of artistic practice, and workflows that are not
simply optimised for efficiency or the new.

1 Introduction
Ingres is said to have created an artistic order out of rest; I
should like to create an order from feeling and, going still
further, from motion.
Paul Klee 1923
More than a decade ago, a close friend started a journey to
enable them to manage personal grief; it would come to rede-
fine their artistic practice and in many ways their world view,
developing a practice diffracted through the lens of community,
slowness, and contemplation. It’s impossible to describe their
artistic practice and output in this short introduction, rather in-
stead what we focus on here, is that which draws us into their
work. More than anything it is their interest and understanding
of the old, often discarded, analogue technology that conjures a
new way of working, pushing against the constant drive of ever
‘better’ technology. For them it is the visual image, for us it is
magnetic tape that inspires questions into the material practice
of music composition and production.
Even with all its ‘progress’, it’s hard to find a truth in the
idea that GenAI can or will fully replicate the warm, imperfect
sound of cassette tapes, which creates a truly special listening
experience. This paper is not about if GenAI can or cannot create

interesting music, it’s about noise, it’s about artistic practice, it’s
about analogue tape and embracing its imperfections. Like what
Dunning refers to as ‘Ironing In The Creases’ [ 13], where the
artist searches for and reinforces a medium’s faults. It’s about
our entanglement with the past and how it influences the music
we make, the noises we create, what Fisher refers to as Hauntol-
ogy [17]. This paper considers how and why the workflow and
‘warm’ sound of a very particular 20𝑡ℎ century sound medium
support and provide insight into the practice of NIME.
The crazy thing is it is not yet over. There are all those crazy
people that are working with cassette.
Lou Ottens (the inventor of the cassette tape) 2016
According to a simple Youtube search the video TAPE LOOP
101 has been watched more than eighty eight thousand times,
which for a medium that was made obsolete, not to mention the
niche application of making a 10sec tape loop, seems impressive.
(A selection of different length tape loops are shown in Figure 2.)
The use of tape to process and produce music reaches far beyond
the doors of academia, contemporary musicians such as Ei Wada,
Hainbach, Erland Cooper, Aaron Dilloway and others utilise the
medium extensively in their practice [4, 12, 18, 21, 40, 52].
Why is this the case, why is tape still so popular in the age of
digital ‘perfection’? Jackson and Kang argue that the languages
of post-humanism and material agency, ‘. . . specific(ly) contexts
of technological breakdown, repair and repurposing. . . ’, have
important things to offer questions of creativity and design in
HCI today [25]. By extension we argue that within the context
of NIME and more generally musical production and expression,
the notion of technological breakdown and repair, finding new
and emerging agency, through intra-activity of this technological
breakdown, enables artists and instruments designers to explore a
practice that is embedded in NIME’s Code of Practice and Ethical
Research [33].
One might wonder if tape’s ghostly presence, along with other
‘expired’ technology, is of interest to us again in part, because of
digital overload, according to Negroponte: ‘like air and drinking
water, being digital will be noticed only by its absence, not its
presence’ [37]. As the ‘tendrils of digital technology’ reach us
all, Cascone argues for a ‘post-digital’ understanding where the
‘medium is no longer the message. . . : the tool has become the
message’ [10]. As musicians worked to understand the end of the
20th century and expand the range of the digitally infected music
of techno, house, and other dance floor music, the emergence
of glitch or microscopic music allowed artists to work beneath
the previously ‘impenetrable’ veil of digital media [10]. Since the
‘death’ of tape was proclaimed in the 2000s [51], so aptly captured
in Basiski’s Disintegration Loops [3], and like the analogue synth
resurgence observed in the domain of Eurorack [ 46], tape as
a medium for producing, distributing, and listening to music
can be heard from experimental ambient through to mainstream
pop music. The sound of tape can be found echoed in J Dilla
inspired LoFi HipHop and the haunting textures of Burial. These
productions often do not use the physical medium of tape itself,
but imply its nostalgic power through its warming compression,
noise, and hiss.
Christopher Morris’s film A Year in a Field surges forward
through slowness, meditating on the impact of climate change [34].
It is more than simply an essay on climate crisis, rather a med-
itation on the natural world and human impact, so often mir-
rored in commodification of the next thing in digital technology.
Travelling through technical developments, as much as political
turmoil, at what seems like the speed of light, it is hard to find
an anchor, difficult to find time to reflect, enquire, and enjoy the
moments of community, the moments of dust settling, the mo-
ments of silence. Morris argues that the film is the ‘antithesis’ of
the ‘million-dollar dazzle’ of the over produced, almost ‘science
fiction’, nature documentaries. Arguably there is a close analogy
with Morris’s interpretation of the nature documentary and the
slowness and processes of working with a medium such as tape,
when compared to the sci-fi like powers of digital technology, as
seen by the incredible leaps in the context of music making and
Generative AI.
It is important to note that while simply pushing against our
society’s need to continually discard the old as part of the goal for
‘growth’, is itself an important stake in the sand, it can often cause
the evaluation that new must be better, new must be more ‘hi-fi’
and old, as a natural conclusion, ‘lo-fi’. However, it is possible
that discarding the old for new is not just concerning from an
environmental standpoint, but also, we are losing not only a
connection with our past, our history, but also neglecting years
of artistic practice with workflows that are not simply optimised
for speed. As Schechner [ 49] explains the ‘social actions’ and
‘cultural performances’ are ‘events’ whose origins are not defined
by the human, rather they are intra-acted via ‘a feedback loop
with the actions’ of humans and non-humans.
Through the audio loop and the feedback loop emerges an
intra-action between human and the tape (or tape machine). Bul-
ter refers to this as a performance [ 8], one that is not simply
different in degree, but in kind. As a ‘feedback loop’, individuals
and objects, or individuals and events, produce phenomena [2];
they are the ontological inseparability of intra-acting agencies.
Both the discrete instances and continuous processes are neces-
sary for history to ‘perform. ’
In this paper we develop an argument through an analysis
of theoretical, ethnographic and performance work. We begin
by reviewing background work, including post-humanist theory
in the humanities, NIME, and more generally HCI that argues

for an expansive way of considering the relationship between
humans and the objects around them (Section 2). This is followed
by an exploration of current practices with tape, through a sur-
vey of musicians utilizing the medium in their artistic practice
(Section 3). We believe that the findings hold design narratives
for the NIME community, when working in the context of the
old and ‘forgotten’ technologies that is central to our and other
artists practice, both in music production and in the design of
new musical instruments. Drawing on these findings we pro-
pose a design space for exploring ‘a circular making practice’
for building new musical interfaces (Section 4). Finally, we bring
these ideas into focus with an autoethnographic [41] description
of two works brought together as Looping slowly, which are
seen together within the context of tape (Section 5). Section 6
concludes with pointers to future work1.
2 Background
Post-humanist theories around entanglement, diffraction and
relational space have long been adopted in the social sciences [2,
8, 22, 28]. Recent work has theorised a model of entanglement
as a fourth wave for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) [ 19]
and recently developed in the context of NIME [35], this paper
further explores these notions through the lens of magnetic tape.

NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Gaster et al.
NIME and related settings has explored entanglement through
the eye of the performer, see for example Reed et al [42], while the
work of Renney et al considers the entangled nature of the digital
instrument designer, within the context of their own musical
practice [43, 44]. Nordmoen and McPherson explore an entangled
material making practice with a diffractive reading of woodwork
and building interactive systems [38].
Trends in Interaction Design education have often focused on
visual feedback and touchscreen interactions, while the classes
of Bak el al [ 1] were developed to provide foundations for de-
sign students to leverage the potential of non-visual modes of
interaction and provide them with tools and skills to develop
complex multimodal, embodied experiences. This notion sits well
with tape’s focus on the non-visual, is in tune with screen as a
material, which often in the case of live musical performance, for
example, is a distraction and disembodies the actor, i.e., the per-
former and musician, from the process at hand, that of producing
a tapestry of sound. Fixed physical interfaces provide for haptic
feedback, location information, and fine grain control even under
the heat and pressure of a dark and ‘sticky’ venue. Rossmy and
Wiethoff explore this notion through the ‘outdated’ technology
of Modular [46], while Zheng et al consider this from a mate-
rial perspective, studying how designers understand deformable
sensor materials in the context of creative aesthetic design [53].
Repair and reuse feature highly in the use of outdated technol-
ogy, such as tape, and Odom et al explore why we preserve some
things and discard others in the context of interaction design [39].
Vail has looked extensively at the reasons tape has lived long
beyond its sell-by-date [51]. The work by Jackson el al, within a
post-humanist setting, considers the use of old and broken tech-
nology in the context of design and maker practice [24, 26]. Masu
et al consider the ‘O’ in NIME, where they reflect on the impor-
tance of reusing and repurposing old Musical instruments [30].
The work of Bowers and their collaborators have long consid-
ered the notion of interaction design, simplicity, and reuse as an
approach to probe NIME design and making [5, 6, 20, 27].
Finally, it would be amiss to not consider the provocative
and ‘warm’ feeling that tape brings to both making music and
in the listening process. Reading this through Fisher’s version
of hauntology, considers it as ‘lost’ futures [ 17]. Seen in this
light the use of nostalgia—as per the title—intends to invoke the
idea that old technology can be remade anew, adapting practices
to fit within a modern workflow. Pushing against the driving
force of economic structures in place for always using the new,
musicians and instrument designers are drawing on a shared
history to create new pieces of art and machines. This can be read
as reflecting NIME’s Code of Practice [33] and more generally
the unfolding climate crisis, rather than wanting to return to a
past that was somehow ‘better’ than now.
3 How do artists view tape?
To explore individual
reasons as to why mu-
sicians utilize tape for
production and musi-
cal performance, we in-
vited participants to doc-
ument their practice
through an online ques-
tionnaire. Developing
this approach and methodology helped to further our under-
standing of where tape sits within musical practice.
Table 1 outlines the survey, which comprised of six categories.
A range of statements were collected for each category. Some
statements were free form text entries, but most were judged
using a 7-level Likert scale (ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ to
‘strongly agree’) [11].
3.1 Study Subjects
42 people responded completing the survey in full, while another
4 partially completed. After some consideration we did not collect
person information. We did, however, request how long they
had been making music (Q1). Their experience in making music
averages around 24 years (4 − 52 years). All participants agreed
that their data is used anonymized for scientific publications (see
Section 7).
3.2 Analysis
Based on the responses of the participants a diverse array of
perspectives and descriptions emerge when attempting to define
how tape is used in their process of making music. Some par-
ticipants emphasise the use of loops, with its long history with
respect to slicing tape loops (Q2), while others used more as an
effect or even end of line processing. More than 50% of partici-
pants said tape was integral to their workflow and preferred a
‘hardware’ or DAWless workflow, over working in the box (Q5,
Q4).
Furthermore, participants highlighted the role of tape within
a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), implying that for some, at
least digital replication of the analogue process was their default
approach. The physical artifacts of tape machines can be large
and hard to maintain, reflected by some participants:
A very interesting way to limit and spice the work-
flow. Would love to use it more often but the ma-
chinery is often heavy and as a student moving
every now and then it can’t follow me everywhere.
(P28)
Participants also highlighted the role of tape as an effect and
as a way of introducing the unknown and failure into their work.
The following response from P14 captures this:
I find that tape is a hugely useful tool for introduc-
ing fallibility and the leitmotifs of failure into my
music. I use it as a medium for sound manipula-
tion—sending things out onto tape from a DAW or
sampler, then back into the DAW or sampler via a
manipulated version of that tape. (P14)
Tape is known for its warm compression, as noted by mas-
tering engineer Stefan Betke2, and as highlighted by participant
P16 sits solely at the at the end of the chain:
mostly used at the end of my process to record my
piece. (P16)
Other participants were more interested in tape as a medium
to access other people’s music, continuing to purchase physical
artifacts rather than simply streaming digitally:
I like tape. I buy tapes to listen to. Have worked
with tape a lot in the past, creatively, but less so at
present. (P23)

Figure 4: Tapey an example of circular making.
Participants commonly used tape for saturation and compres-
sion, but also exploring texture and other effects caused by direct
manipulation:
I saturate with tape mostly, but I also use tape to
slow down or speed up sounds to add a different tex-
ture to them before restoring them to their original
tempo within the DAW/sampler. (P14)
Playback of pre-recorded audio, speed manipula-
tion, live sampling (recording and playback of self
and others during performance), playback of tape
glued to a record with a separate tape head. (P23)
There was a general consensus of participants getting used
devices from sites such as Reverb, with a few highlighting thrift
stores and parents lofts:
Parents old equipment, thrift shop, one professional
reel to reel that I had to chance to get for free in
the caves of my former school. (P28)
2nd-hand shops. (P20)
Many participants were happy or at least willing to fix, mod-
ify and extend devices (Q13, Q15), while it was often that old
machines would not be in good working order (Q14).
A common thread was participant’s use and access to online
communities, such as forums and other online groups, for ex-
ample, those found on Discord. It should be noted that as most
participants were recruited via an online call, it does not seem
unreasonable to assume that this would be the case (Q26, Q27).
Most participants purchased and listened to music from means
other than Spotify or mainstream streaming services (Q28). Based
on the responses of the participants a diverse array of perspec-
tives and descriptions emerge when considering how as artists
they release music, but most had or would release music via tape
or other physical mediums and not simply via digital streaming
services (Q31, Q32).
3.3 Discussion
The analysis in this paper presents initial findings, constructing
narratives that focus on distinct aspects of how musicians ap-
proach working with tape. While alone these ideas are insightful,
when viewed together and within the context of existing work,
we can develop further insights into how the old can be remade
anew, and begin to form hypotheses from observations that can
be explored in future work.
Perspectives from participants suggest an interplay between
a fixed and limited workflow. They are inspired by materials and
problem solving, fixing old machines, all to reach an end goal.
We see this described by P28, who says:
I use tape to limit myself to a number of channels
using a loop of tape on a reel to reel. When I do this,
the stereo becomes a kind of dual mono. The tape
cannot overdub (workaround aside) and it creates
those sound collage with very sharp delimitation. I
sometimes replicate this workflow on my daw, also
it doesn’t have the same grainy texture coherence,
it still leads to new-to-me structures and ideas (P28)
Finally, we observe that participants across the study heavily
emphasised their interest in the processing of loops with tape for
sound generation. Due to the clear interest in electronic music
production, this observation is not surprising; it is affirming to
see that through observational findings, this shared focus across
research and practice is well aligned and motivates continued
exploration in this area. Through old analogue machines, mu-
sicians seek to create more expressive instruments, which we
suggest reinforces a design space to NIME practitioners that can
support a more sustainable maker practice that we introduce as
‘circular making’ in Section 4.
4 A circular making practice for musical
instruments
In conjunction with the ideas
considered in this paper and
significantly inspired by the
use of tape, we have begun
to outline an approach to our
practice, which we currently
present as a ‘circular maker
practice’, which positions our
work alongside other work at
NIME on sustainability and the
environment [29, 32]. The perspective of viewing technology
through an approach that embraces slowness and constraints, re-
quiring adaptability and improvisation, creates a lens to consider
Looping slowly: Diffraction through the lens of nostalgia NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia

our wider practice as creative technologists. It affords a chance to
consider how we might reconcile our practice and approach with
broader social goals and ideologies, entangling the way we create
with the environment, our understanding and our broader social
roles. At this current stage, we consider how our practice can
integrate sustainability and reuse as a motivating and inspiring
constraint that allows us to practice the creation of new technol-
ogy in a more environmentally conscious way, perhaps not in a
way that will make a significant distinction to the climate crisis
and other environmental problems. Rather in a way that may
demonstrate its importance, share ideas and develop solutions,
and inspire approaches to creation that allow for production and
limits [23, 36, 45], at the core of circular degrowth, to co-exist. An
ethos inspired, in part, by computing within maker practice, we
aim to factor in three main priorities when creating technology:
• to prepare for the full lifecycle from inception to disposal;
• to plan for maintainability and longevity; and
• to consider the sustainability and impact of the processes
employed and the other technologies upon which we build.
To consider the full lifecycle of a piece of technology from the
outset calls for preparation for dissolution through ideas such
as unmaking [48, 50], planning for the reuse of components or
repurposing/recontextualising, for example, by conversion from
technological artefact to art. In planning for longevity, practices
such as stable, modular design offer more multifaceted technol-
ogy, which motivates its maintenance and increases its value by
sharing its role across projects. We also consider our practice
around processes and the reach of the tools and technology on
which we base our work, for example, considering if using sys-
tems such as generative artificial intelligence are appropriate in
achieving the project’s goals and are ethically and sustainably in
line with our goals.
As we develop these ideas, we present and document them,
storyboarding a narrative representation in Figure 5 showing
the creation of a new device, its use and then its dissolution
or unmaking, where some components are recovered for reuse,
some are composted, and some are creatively leveraged for art.
In presenting these ideas, we want to make it clear that we do
not suppose circular maker practice is a far-reaching solution in
tackling climate change or if that individual action such as this
can truly address these issues, but rather to acknowledge our
need for awareness and action toward constructive solutions that
address the topic. By integrating these ideas, we aim to develop
and embody a set of rules that may be important in exploring the
practicality of minimising the impact of what we create in a wider
design context and providing mechanisms for reconciling them
with our use of technology. We include this section to provide a
trail of how these ideas evolve and to allow us to connect with
the reflective, techno-artistic context from which they originated.
Figure 4 shows an example of this process in action. Tapey
is musical controller reflective of ‘circular’ making, constructed
from a process of recycling found cardboard, cast in the form of
a cassette, recycled components from our lab, and a Raspberry Pi
Pico reclaimed from an earlier project. At the end of life Tapey
can be unmade, composting the cast components, the silicon mold
itself is cut up as filler for new mold making, and the components
reused in future projects!
The following link is an example recording made with Tapey
and a MaxMSP noise patch inspired by tape hiss. The patch
includes a selection of LFOs and wave-folding techniques to
extend beyond the simple static noise, common of tape.

5 Looping Slowly
Inspired by these findings and building on the theoretical foun-
dations laid out above, we choose two snapshots of work from
our own artistic practice that is entangled with tape practices
in some way for musical creation and research. With the aim of
again exploring and developing these ethnographic insights with
two reimaginings, through the lens of tape.
These insights and findings are documented in the following
subsections as autoethnographic [41] presentations of work by
the first and third authors.
5.1 16-bars: tape loops in the woods
In this section we consider the
first author’s use of tape and its
inspired intra-action as part of
developing a sound collage for
listening in the woods. With
sound artist t l h , the first au-
thor was commissioned to pro-
duce a tape inspired work that
explored songlines within city
woodlands. The final work, 16-bars, was part of a larger piece by

artist Esther May Campbell, for her Anything Moving and What
Remains work at the MayK festival [31]. An intimate guided trail
in the wonderful nook that is Nightingale Woods3.
Anything Moving and What Remains was a close encounter
with the ‘Anything Moving’ trilogy of short films made by kids
and animals, that invited artists to wander through ‘what remains’
of a month long Mayfest residency in the trees. Each situation
explored children’s play and interaction in the woods and 16-bars
explored the looping sounds of Nightingale Valley, a community
woodland that supports a large variety of wildlife, especially
birds, hidden in Bristol’s St Annes area.
Figure 6: Tape loop speaker Yellow (1 of 3) swinging in the
woods.
The original recordings were made during an afternoon in
the woods, where a group of eleven young people told stories,
played with analogue cameras, and made field recordings of
wood banging and other noises materialized onto tape, as they
spoke and performed as part of the sound making process. These
loops were arranged into a set of three 16-bar loops by t l h
and later processed through tape by the first author. Each loop
was converted to an MP3, written to SD card, which was then
installed in a small battery powered speaker.
The closing night of Mayfest, the last weekend of May 2024,
saw Anything Moving and What Remains invite the public to
enter Nightingale woods, as the sun set, for a night of films, mus-
ing and 16-bar sound collages hanging from trees. Participants
explored sounds and moving images as the woods shifted focus
to the night, torches reflected ghosts, as sounds shifted from the
recorded to the ethereal and back. As seen in Figures 6 and 7. New
friendships were fostered, connections and emotional resilience
was entangled as ghosts of earlier times in the woods bounced
in and out of focus.
The following audio links are the final 16-bar loops, one for
each of the 3 speakers, that were placed around Nightingale
woods, as seen in Figure 6.

5.2 Charcoal tape loop
3Nightingale Woods is an inner city woodland in the centre of Bristol UK.
In this section we consider
the thirds author’s autoethno-
graphic study inspired by the
use of disintegration in tape
loop practices. Arguably the
most infamous example being
William Basinski’s Disintegra-
tion loops [3].
This study made use of char-
coal, a paper loop, a paint
brush, a can attached to a
motor, and a visual-to-audio
wavetable synthesiser called
the pattern organ [9]. The Pattern organ runs on Pure Data on
a Raspberry Pi. It takes information from a camera, averages
luminance fluctuations along the x axis and reads these values
into a wavetable. For this study, the wavetable was scanned at a
constantly low frequency.
Figure 7: 16 bars projection in the woods.
The circumference of a can was measured, and a paper strip
was divided into four sections. These were further divided and
marked with pencil, both horizontally and vertically. The paper
was slipped over a can that had been salvaged from a communal
recycling bin and washed.
The markings on the paper loop were used to draw a bold
charcoal pattern onto the strip. The pattern was simple but aimed
to have some repeating motifs, where there were areas of finer
striped detail, and simple diamonds, creating movement between
different areas of harmonic complexity.
A brush was placed against the can and the paper strip, so
that when the motor was turned on, the pattern would revolve
underneath a camera, creating a repeating pattern of shifting
harmonics. While revolving, the brush would slowly remove or
displace the charcoal. This is captured visually in Figure 8.
The motor turned and the pattern organ synthesised sound for
over 40 minutes. During this time my ears were tuned into very
detailed patterns in the sound between loops, but not necessarily

able to pick up longer gradual changes over the course of the
study.
Peculiarities in the sound drew my attention to material phe-
nomena that I hadn’t noticed. The brush wore away at the char-
coal pattern, and the louder patterned harmonics took around
5 minutes to decay to a lower amplitude that felt like it had
stabilised.
I left the machine running long after the study felt like it
could have been over. The charcoal pattern had stained the paper,
so there was a ghost image that stayed for the duration of the
study, and an audible faint rhythmic harmonic pattern remained.
During the last 35 minutes of the study, slower, more emergent
qualities of the loop were observed.
I gradually noticed a dip in the sound followed by a quick
harmonic swell. Looking at the visual pattern, I realised that the
charcoal was gathering at the lipped join of the paper loop. This
created a strip of black that made a dip in the signal. At the time
this felt very noticeable, but re-listening to the clip subsequently
the dip in sound does not sound so pronounced. Perhaps this is
because at the time I had stayed with the loop for 30 plus minutes
so I was more attuned to small details in the sound.
. . .The join is often a point of sonic interest in the tape loop. It
is a point of material break, often made with a sellotape splice,
where the signal behaves and is read differently. This join is not a
straightforward gap. It creates sonic peculiarities at its borders, and
is often the loudest point in a tape loop as the magnetic material is
stuck down where at other points it flakes away.
Another noticeable behaviour of the charcoal loop is the addi-
tional harmonics created by the quality of the brush. The brush
had seen better days, and was picked up from a communal area
of a shared studio. The quality of the bristles were not noticed
at first, but as the study progressed, I became aware that the
brush was wearing away at some parts of the pattern more than
others, creating a striped fluctuation of erasure that resulted in
an emergence of high harmonics in the output signal. Erasing
a signal doesn’t always mean taking something away. In this
instance a new feature was added to the signal. The charcoal was
displaced, not erased, and a new pattern emerged.
The following audio captures the first five minutes of the char-
coal can loop and a section from around 38 minutes, respectively.

6 Conclusion
The study and artistic work presented in this paper explores
how the use and ideas, found in old and obsolete technology,
in magnetic tape, are being utilized to develop musical practice
and create an array of new sounds. These notions support and
strengthen the NIME community’s interests and suggest there is
a great deal of opportunity to invest in deepening our understand-
ing of how musicians and designers approach old technology
and remake it anew.
More generally, through considering the entangled nature of
musical practice and working with materials, such as magnetic
tape, we can presume that work shared through communities
such as NIME is a key focus in the practice of digital lutherie and
the design of new instruments, that merits continued investiga-
tion and development. Opinionated design can be seen as a core
philosophy in the design of DMI, but also can lay groundwork
Figure 8: ’Charcoal pattern’ slowly disintegrating.
for a more ethical approach to instrument design and building,
that aligns directly with NIME’s Code of Practice.
Drawing on our findings we have outlined a design space for
exploring ‘a circular making practice’ for building new musical
interfaces. This is an exciting area of future research that tightly
integrates sustainability into the creation of digital technology
in general and more specifically digital musical instruments. In-
spired by how musicians work with tape and more generally
by the maker/hacker movement, this practice emphasises utilis-
ing technology in a minimalistic way that serves the intended
function whilst also factoring in other social priorities. We aim
to prioritise democratising technology creation without increas-
ing environmental impact by requiring approaches to include
composability/ recyclability that can be achieved at home, not
through commercial processes, for example. These sparks con-
nect closely with the emerging area of unmaking [48, 50] and we
expect to find threads that can be woven between NIME design
and that of circular making.
Finally, building on this work more detailed study of how musi-
cians use tape as part of their musical practice seems needed. We
are planning to interview a range of musicians about their prac-
tice, along with a performative approach of collecting (im)perfect
pictures through the process of Snaplogs [7]. Participants will be
provided with prompts asking for them to capture pictures that
reflect some part of their workflow, along with a short textural
response.
An important area of future work, one that we have not fol-
lowed within this work, is how mediums such as tape fit within
the landscape of media preservation and obsolete formats [14–
16, 47].
