ABSTRACT
We introduce theTriplexer, a novel foot controller that gives
the performer 3 degrees of freedom over the control of var-
ious eﬀects parameters. With the Triplexer, we aim to ex-
pand the performer’s control space by augmenting the ca-
pabilities of the common expression pedal that is found in
most eﬀects rigs. Using industrial-grade weight-detection
sensors and widely-adopted communication protocols, the
Triplexer oﬀers a ﬂexible platform that can be integrated
into various performance setups and situations. In this pa-
per, we detail the design of the Triplexer by describing its
hardware, embedded signal processing, and mapping soft-
ware implementations. We also oﬀer the results of a user
study, which we conducted to evaluate the usability of our
controller.

1. INTRODUCTION
The expression pedal is a staple of many guitar eﬀects se-
tups. It allows the performer to map a continuous one-
dimensional control to various parameters on other pedals
(e.g. delay time, reverb amount). Additionally, wah wah
and volume pedals, which directly alter the audio signal,
rely on the same interaction design.
Given that the transfer of human weight through the foot
can be applied with diﬀerent intensities and in multiple
dimensions, foot control can be used with ﬁner precision
to drive more than one parameter at a time. Although 3
degrees-of-freedom interfaces have been gaining more trac-
tion over the last decade, most of these new interfaces are
geared for hand control, often in the form of augmented
piano keyboards. With the Triplexer, we aim to oﬀer a sim-
ilar 3 degrees-of-freedom interaction in the form factor of
an expression pedal. To enable the performer to use the

whole weight of their body as a means of musical expres-
sion, we use extremely sensitive load cells and a series of sig-
nal processing techniques to derive 3-dimensional pressure
data. Using the ﬂexible output options on the Triplexer,
this data can then be mapped to parameters in an eﬀects
setup or software to manipulate various qualities of sound.
In this paper, we oﬀer detailed descriptions of theTriplexer
hardware and software. We then describe various use cases
both in terms of the device’s integration into existing eﬀects
setups, and also in terms of how the users can interact with
it. Finally, we oﬀer the results of a user study, which we
conducted with 10 musicians that have diﬀerent degrees of
experience with expression pedals. We analyze these results
to determine the usability of our interface, and how it can
be improved to better suit the needs of performers.
2. RELATED WORK
There are numerous hardware interfaces which oﬀer multi-
dimensional control. Many of these are designed for use
with hands. For example, Wessel et al. describe interfaces
composed of an array of 16 or 24 force-sensitive XYZ pads
[11]. More recently, Roli has introduced the Seaboard 1,
which expands upon the common piano interface with soft
keys that are capable of tracking ﬁnger movements in three
dimensions. Similarly, the Linnstrument 2 features a large
array of pressure sensitive keys that also measure XY posi-
tion.
In addition to such hand-oriented interfaces, there are
also controllers that aim to improve the common foot switch
and expression pedal design. A popular example is Keith
McMillen Instruments’ SoftStep 2 3, which is a multi-pad
foot controller, where each pad is sensitive to changes in
pressure and XY position relying on the manufacturer’s
multi-touch controller design [6]. The controller has 10 pads
that are in the shape of a plus sign that is slightly smaller
than 2 inches in width. While this layout oﬀers a signiﬁcant
number of control outputs that can be mapped to various
parameters, the size of the pads limits the area onto which
the foot can be placed.
The Telonics FP-1004 is based on the common expression
pedal with the addition of sensors to determine the angular
position of the pedal. This way the user can choose between
various taper characteristics for the volume curve to achieve
ﬁner control over the pedal’s attenuation of input signals.
The Pressure-Sensing Pedal[2] uses a force sensitive resis-
tor (FSR) sandwiched between a piece of plywood and foam
cut to the size of a foot. The pedal is designed for tracking
taps for tempo adjustment. Rhythm’n’Shoes, by Papetti et

al. is a wearable system that involves sandals that are sim-
ilarly equipped with FSRs. The output of these resistors
are used to control physical modeling synthesis [8]. Actua-
tors on the sandals provide tactile feedback to the performer
while wireless transmitters are used for untethered connec-
tion to a host computer. Each force sensor is sensitive to
an upper limit of about 5 pounds, which is a typical draw-
back for FSRs under conditions that require a wider range
of responses to weight. Like the Pressure-Sensing Pedal,
Rhythm’n’Shoes is optimized for tracking transient events.
In another wearable design, Konvalovs et al. describe
an apparatus that involve multiple motion sensors that can
be attached to a shoe [4]. The apparatus detects speciﬁc
foot gestures, which are used to switch eﬀects on or oﬀ.
While tilting the foot forward and backward can be used
to control a wah wah eﬀect, the primary use of the device
is described as binary controls rather than those that are
continuous. Based on a similar design, a patent ﬁling from
2013 describes the use of various sensors in a shoe to track
the movements of the performers foot [1]. The data gath-
ered from these sensors are transferred wirelessly to a base
unit, which maps these to various eﬀects parameters.
Although several pressure and position sensitive foot con-
trollers oﬀer physical interfaces similar to that of theTriplexer,
these diﬀer in intended application and style of use. Some
of these are geared towards tracking dance movements [10,
3, 9], and so they oﬀer surfaces that are considerably larger
than that of the Triplexer. The footPad [5] is a platform
that is operated with both feet, and measures position, as
well as tracking speciﬁc gestures. Its intended purpose is de-
scribed as manipulating transport controls in digital audio
workstations.
3. TRIPLEXER
To improve upon the single dimensionality of the common
expression pedal, we designed the Triplexer, which is a foot
controller that oﬀers 3 degrees of freedom. Using industrial-
grade load cells placed on each corner of the pedal plat-
form, the device is capable of sensing ﬁne movements on
front-back (Y), left-right (X), and up-down (Z) axes. What
sets apart the Triplexer from current oﬀerings in multi-
dimensional foot control is its sensing mechanism that is
designed to measure heavy loads. This implies that the per-
former can use the whole weight of their body as a source of
expression for detailed control of various eﬀects parameters
as demonstrated in our video abstract. 5 In addition to foot
gestures used with expression pedals, the user can also uti-
lize leaning and swaying motions, which can naturally occur
during a performance, for parameter control.
The output of the Triplexer can be used to control other
pedals or software: the embedded system supports two-
way MIDI and Open Sound Control (OSC) [13] messaging
as seen in Fig. 3. Since most modern DSP-based stomp-
boxes implement MIDI communication, the Triplexer can
easily be integrated into existing eﬀects setups. A built-
in screen on the controller, as seen in Fig. 1 facilitates the
mapping of MIDI messages without requiring a computer.
Furthermore, a desktop application, seen in Fig. 6 allows
the Triplexer to communicate with any software via USB.
3.1 Hardware Design
The Triplexer hardware consists of a custom 3D-printed
and laser-cut enclosure, a Teensy microcontroller, custom
circuitry for processing sensor signals, a physical user inter-
face, MIDI input and output, and a power supply. A layout
of this hardware is seen in Fig. 2.

of a foot overlaid for illustration.
3.1.1 Electronics
To achieve 3 degrees of freedom with high pressure sensi-
tivity, we used 4 button-style load cells located in each cor-
ner of the enclosure. Load cells, which are widely used for
weight measurement in various commercial and industrial
applications, are capable of measuring much larger forces
than an individual force sensitive resistor. The load cells
used in the Triplexer are rated for 200kg each, so it can
respond to a very large range of forces without a risk of
overloading the sensors.
Load cells work by forming a Wheatstone bridge with re-
sistances that vary with strain on the sensor [7]. Because the
resistances in the Wheatstone bridge change on the order of
milliohms, the diﬀerential signal coming from the load cell
is at a very low level. An instrumentation ampliﬁer is used
to get this signal from the millivolt range into a range usable
by the Teensy microcontroller’s analog-to-digital converter
(ADC).
The on-board user interface consists of a character LCD
screen and several buttons, which allow the user to perform
calibration and navigate a menu system for the conﬁgura-
tion of various settings including control mappings, optional
inversion of each axis, response curves and pedal sensitivity,
and saving and loading settings from the bank in EEPROM.
The MIDI circuitry was designed to comply with the
MIDI electrical standard. It supports IN, THROUGH, and
OUT connections, which makes the Triplexer easy to use
in various MIDI setups with keyboards, eﬀects pedals, and
other musical interfaces. Panel mount MIDI jacks are posi-
tioned on the front edge of the electronics enclosure.
Power is supplied using a 2.1mm barrel jack, which is
common for eﬀects pedals. This way, the Triplexer can be
integrated into existing pedal power systems, such as the
264
Figure 2– Triplexer hardware layout.
Voodoo Labspower supplies6. Voltage is regulated down to
5V for MIDI circuitry, per the MIDI standard, and 3.3V for
the rest of the design. The entire circuit is custom-ﬁtted
onto a 2-layer PCB.
3.1.2 Enclosure
The Triplexer has been designed with portability in mind.
The enclosure, seen in Fig. 1, consists of two main sections,
both attached to a base plate that forms the footprint of the
device. The platform, custom built from a sheet of quarter
inch 6061 aluminum, is 12” by 6”, with a layer of rubber
padding on top. The height of the platform is 1”, which
makes it much shallower than the common expression pedal.
The platform rests on four load cells positioned near its cor-
ners. These load cells are attached with machine screws to
the base plate, which is also 6061 aluminum. This material
was chosen to achieve a high level of durability under user
weight.
The electronics and on-board user interface are housed in
a 3D-printed box ﬁxed on the bottom plate where the foot
surface ends. MIDI, USB type B, and DC power jacks are
all located on the far end of this box away from the user’s
foot. The screen and the buttons are on the top surface of
the box.
3.2 Software Design
3.2.1 Data Transmission and Processing
The Triplexer’s embedded software implements a series of
signal processing and data processing techniques, which trans-
form the raw data from the load cells into useful OSC and
MIDI messages. The overall latency from sensor input to
the completion of USB data transmission is approximately 3
ms, which is under the with the 10 ms latency requirement
suggested by Wessel and Wright [12]. The signal ﬂow of
this process is seen in Fig. 5. First, input values from each
load cell are adjusted for individual zero-balance and sensi-
tivity. These calibrated values are then used to calculate a
center of mass value, which is used to derive raw X and Y
positions. The data from individual cells are also summed

possible use cases.
for the Z value, which reﬂects the total weight. The total
weight can be adjusted for each user via a calibration pro-
cess, which sets the maximum desired total weight. The
calibration process can be initiated at any time using the
physical UI of the controller.
The calibrated and averaged X, Y, and Z values are used
as indices into response curves for each axis. The user can
adjust these curves for each axis using two parameters, each
ranging from 0 to 100 with a step size of 1. The ﬁrst is a
”sensitivity” parameter which controls the shape of the re-
sponse. A value of 0 produces an exponential shape, a value
of 50 produces a linear shape, and a value of 100 produces a
logarithmic shape. The second curve parameter is ”width”,
which allows the perceived dimensions of the platform to be
adjusted in software to ﬁt a user’s foot size and style of use.
Speciﬁcally, it adjusts the range in which indices result in
outputs between zero (for low raw input values) and a max-
imum value (for high raw input values). Indices outside this
range all produce the maximum or minimum output value.
A value of 0 results in a curve which uses about half of the
available length along an axis, and a value of 100 uses all
of the available length. Fig. 4 shows the range of possible
response curve shapes.
The processed signals are output as MIDI and OSC mes-
sages. Since they are calculated as 16-bit integers, the least
signiﬁcant 9 bits are discarded for MIDI output. The MIDI

tial through linear to logarithmic shape; right: response

and OSC messages are also output at the Triplexer’s full
1 kHz over USB, but MIDI using the much slower conven-
tional UART port is downsampled to avoid starving out
other MIDI signals.
If no force is applied to the platform, instead of going
through the process described above, outputs are calculated
from the most recent non-zero values. This allows the user
to remove their foot and have the system maintain its state,
which is similar to leaving an expression pedal at a partic-
ular angle. A separate ring buﬀer keeps a history of values
for this purpose. The user can achieve the eﬀect of zero
total weight applied (i.e. a Z value of 0) by leaving the foot
in light contact with the platform for a brief moment before
removing it.
3.2.2 Front-end User Interface
The OSC capabilities of the Triplexer facilitates the exter-
nal control of various device settings, as well as the mapping
of the sensory data to software parameters. The performer
can use any software that supports OSC to conﬁgure the
device in real-time. To further facilitate this process, we
designed a software using PureData, as seen in Fig. 6, that
serves as both a device conﬁguration tool, and a mapping
interface for routing messages between the Triplexer and
other software.
3.3 Applications
In general, the Triplexer’s potential uses extend to any do-
main where the 3D-parameter space or hands-free operation
are of use. Its primary intended use is as an interface to con-
trol external eﬀects. In this use case, the user’s hands may
be occupied with playing an instrument while the feet are
used to expressively control eﬀects parameters. The output
ports on the device facilitate connection to other eﬀects ped-
als or to a computer, while GUI available on the device or on
a connected computer make it easy to conﬁgure and route
as desired. We have tested several speciﬁc use cases. For
example, a guitarist controlling pedals with MIDI inputs, or
a keyboardist controlling synthesizer parameters by insert-
ing the Triplexer between a standard MIDI controller and
a synthesizer. Because USB MIDI and OSC are available,
it is also simple to control eﬀects in computer software.
The Triplexer can also be used as a stand-alone instru-
ment. We have experimented with using it to control sound

ware built in PureData.
generation in PureData by mapping its output to the ampli-
tude envelope, quantized pitch and ﬁltering of a synthesized
sound. We found the one-millisecond time resolution to be
suﬃcient to provide a sense of smooth expression in this
context, and the 3-dimensional foot control of sound gener-
ation felt intuitive.
In a similar application, we mapped the outputs of the
Triplexer to various parameters of a granular synthesizer.
We found the use of the whole weight of the body to control,
for instance, the density of grains in a continuous cloud to
create interesting gestural metaphors.
3.3.1 Extended Techniques
The platform can be used physically in a variety of ways.
Perhaps the most obvious way is by placing a single foot
on the platform, and leaving it there for continuous control.
This mode of interaction is the most similar to how existing
expression pedals are used.
Another approach is to place both feet on the platform.
This can be done while facing to the side, a method of use
we refer to as ”skateboard” style. We found the pedal’s
3D output in relation to the user’s swaying motions in this
pose to yield intuitive results when mapped to eﬀects. The
pose also makes it especially easy to reach anywhere within
the continuous range of the left-right and front-back axes.
The resulting gesture is similar to those performed on a
Wii Balance Board, which also performs a center of mass
calculation to facilitate ﬁtness applications within the Wii
framework. 7
If ongoing control is not desired, the Triplexer can be

used more as a switch. When it detects that no weight is
applied to the platform, it stays in the same state as before
weight was removed. As a result, the platform can be used
as if it were a stompbox switch by stepping brieﬂy on the
platform to achieve some combination of settings, and then
removing the foot from its surface.
4. USER STUDY
We conducted a user study to evaluate 1) the usability of
the Triplexer as a 3-degrees-of-freedom expression pedal,
2) mapping strategies between eﬀects parameters and the
Triplexer’s control axes, and 3) extended techniques for the
Triplexer in various performance contexts. Every instance
of the study was recorded audio-visually. We worked with
a diverse group of musicians to assess various scenarios in
which the device can be used to augment an existing setup,
or facilitate novel use cases.
4.1 Participants
The study was conducted with 10 participants. Among the
participants were 8 guitar players who had varying degrees
of experience with eﬀects pedals ranging from not having
used them at all to having professionally performed with
pedals for several decades. Among the two remaining par-
ticipants were a professional pianist and a violinist. The
pianist had some experience with expression pedals, while
the violinist had no experience using eﬀects of any kind.
Each study lasted approximately 45 minutes.
4.2 Method
The participants were ﬁrst given a brief tutorial on the op-
eration of the Triplexer. The following study consisted of
three sections.
In the ﬁrst section, the participants were presented with
a set of pre-determined mappings between eﬀects parame-
ters and control axes. These were ”distortion amount” on
the front-back (Y) axis, ”tremolo depth” in the left-right
(X) axis, and ”reverb amount” on the up-down (Z) axis.
The choice of parameters in this section was made with the
aim of having individual axes address separate (i.e. spec-
tral, temporal, and spatial) qualities of sound that can be
easily distinguished from one another. The users were ﬁrst
introduced with the axes in isolation so as to allow them
to gain a sense of the pedal’s response in individual axes.
They were then asked to try two-axis combinations (i.e. X-
Y, X-Z, and Y-Z). Finally, they were asked to perform with
all three axes enabled. At the end of the ﬁrst section, they
were asked to ﬁll out a brief survey.
In the second section, the users were introduced to the
Triplexer’s desktop software, which allows the mapping of
axes to parameters as seen in Fig. 6. They were then asked
to try out diﬀerent combinations of parameters on each
axis, and perform with these settings. The available pa-
rameters in this section included ”distortion amount”, ”delay
feedback”, ”tremolo rate”, ”tremolo depth”, ”wah wah rate”,
”wah wah depth”, ”chorus amount”, and ”reverb amount”.
At the end of this section, the users were asked to ﬁll out
another brief survey.
In the third section of the study, the users were asked to
explore extended techniques for using theTriplexer. Among
these were some of the techniques we discussed under Sec-
tion 3.3, such as mounting the pedal sideways with both
feet using the ”skateboard” style, depressing the pedal non-
uniformly (i.e. by partially mounting it), and tapping parts
of the pedal of the surface. The users were also encouraged
to try out any techniques that they could think of. The
users were then asked to ﬁll out a ﬁnal survey.
4.3 Results and Discussion
In the ﬁrst section of the study, we were primarily inter-
ested in monitoring the users’ general interaction with the
Triplexer, to what extent they were able to control the in-
dividual axes, and how this aﬀected their performance. In
Fig. 7, it can be seen that the users rated the up-down axis
the most comfortable to use, with left-right described as the
least comfortable. When asked about which combination
of two axes felt most natural, 6 of the 10 users responded
”up-down and front-back”, 3 users said ”front-back and left-
right”, and 1 user said ”up-down and left-right”.
Figure 7– Responses to questions about how comfortable
it was to control a parameter using an individual axis (i.e.
either up-down, front-back, or left-right), with 0: not com-
fortable at all, 5: very comfortable.
In the second section, we were interested observing which
eﬀects combinations they deemed to be most suitable for
controlling within the 3D parameter space. Most users
spent about 15 minutes experimenting with various map-
pings. In the following survey, the users were asked to iden-
tify the eﬀects that were best suited for the individual axes
during 3D control. With the number of users indicated in
parentheses, for the front-back axis the users listed tremolo
(4), wah wah (3), distortion (1); for the up-down axis: re-
verb (2), wah wah (2), delay (1), tremolo (1), chorus (1), dis-
tortion (1); and for the left-right axis: tremolo (3), wah wah
(2), distortion (1). Although there is no signiﬁcant trend
in these responses, tremolo and wah wah eﬀects were the
most frequent answers across all axes. Also interestingly,
reverb and delay eﬀects were almost exclusively listed for
the up-down axis. Although our sample size is fairly small,
this result encourages further research into whether the em-
bodied interaction involved in controlling the up-down axis
with the user’s full weight has a kinesthetic relationship with
the senses of prolongation and spatial expansion involved in
reverb and delay eﬀects.
One user primarily focused on controlling eﬀect rates on
diﬀerent axes (e.g. tremolo rate on one and wah rate on the
other) to create cross-eﬀect beatings. A violinist, who did
not have previous experience with eﬀects pedals, said she
was surprised by how natural the translation of her move-
ments into eﬀect changes was. When the users were asked
about what other eﬀects would be suitable to be controlled
with the Triplexer but were not included in the study, the
responses included volume, phaser, and ﬁlter.
In the third section, we aimed to understand whether any
of the extended techniques we outlined in Section 3.3, were
considered by the users as viable methods of performing
with the Triplexer. We were also curious to see what other
methods the users would come up with. The ”skateboard”
technique was overwhelmingly popular among the partici-
pants. Users described that they were able to transfer the
natural sway of their body during a performance to the con-
trol of a parameter, which felt more natural than explicitly
controlling a pedal.
267
In the survey that followed this section, in addition to
expressing their thoughts on the extended techniques, the
users were also asked to provide general comments and re-
quests regarding the Triplexer in the form of linear-scale
ratings and written responses. In response to a question
about how the Triplexer could be integrated into the user’s
existing setup or playing style, 3 users mentioned that it
would best be used to augment their existing setups. 3
users deemed suitable for more experimental uses such as
continuous shaping of tone and texture. One user stated
that it would be best for controlling time and space based
eﬀects, while another mentioned that they would use it with
eﬀect that would widen the sound of their acoustic guitar.
Figure 8 – Responses to questions asking users to rate
1) the sensitivity at which the Triplexer responded to user
movements (0: not sensitive at all, 5: very sensitive); 2)
how the user’s intents while performing with the Triplexer
matched the results (0: did not match at all, 5: matched
perfectly); 3) whether the user’s control over the Triplexer
improved over time (0: strongly disagree, 5: strongly agree);
and 4) how playable the Triplexer was overall (0: not
playable at all, 5: very playable).
One user who had professional experience working with
people with disabilities argued that the Triplexer would po-
tentially be more accessible than a conventional expression
pedal for that population. Shifting weight on a platform
could hypothetically be done in a variety of ways that would
require less dexterity while, for instance, seated on a plat-
form.
5. FUTURE WORK AND CONCLUSIONS
Based on the promising results of our user study, we have
outlined several possible improvements for the Triplexer.
The PureData tool that visualizes the user’s position on the
pedal, seen in Fig.6, was initially designed as a debugging
tool during software development. During our preliminary
studies, it became apparent that some visual feedback is
useful while using the Triplexer. This assumption was fur-
ther conﬁrmed during the second part of the user study,
where participants were allowed to use the visual monitor
while choosing parameter mappings. All participants found
the display helpful, and several suggested that a similar dis-
play would be useful on the device itself. Accordingly, we
elaborated a new design of the Triplexer that includes a
graphical display instead of a character display, so that, in
addition to the menu system being available when needed,
it would also be possible to display the foot position on the
pedal.
The general preference among users towards controlling
time and space based eﬀects has prompted us to conduct
further research into the kinesthetic relationship between
audio aﬀects and their embodied cognition. As a result of
this, we hope to identify audio eﬀects combinations that can
be built into the Triplexer so that it will also function as a
stand-alone eﬀects pedal.
The strong preference towards the ”skateboard”technique
has encouraged us to explore diﬀerent mechanical designs
including a longer platform which the users could more eas-
ily mount with both feet standing sideways. We also intend
to create calibration presets for diﬀerent poses, such as play-
ing while sitting down. These presets will automatically set
the response curve in a way that better suits the use case.
We believe that theTriplexer improves upon the common
expression pedal design in a way that signiﬁcantly expands
the performer’s control space. It facilitates the integration
of the user’s bodily expressions into performance practices
with a form factor and connectivity options that ﬁt within
existing eﬀects setups.
