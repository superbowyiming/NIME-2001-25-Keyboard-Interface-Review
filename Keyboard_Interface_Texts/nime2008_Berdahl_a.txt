ABSTRACT
We introduce physicallymotivated interfaces for playing vir-
tual musical instruments, and we suggest that they lie some-
where in between commonplace interfaces and haptic inter-
faces in termso ft h e i rc omplexity. Next, we review guitar-
like interfaces, and we design an interface to a virtual string.
The excitation signal and pitch are sensed separately using
two independent string segments. These parameters control
a two-axis digital waveguide virtual string, which models
vibrations in the horizontal and vertical transverse axes as
well as the coupling between them.F i n a l l y , w e c o n s i d e r t h e

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Physical Models
Virtual models of acousticmusical instruments have been
available to themusic community for decades [7] [18] [13].
The models are useful for studying the physical behavior of
acoustic musical instruments, and they can also synthesize
sound output. Given an appropriate interface,many of the
models can be played in real-timeb yp e r f o rmers.
1.1.1 Commonplace Interfaces
Often it ismost convenient and simplest to control a phys-
ical model with a commonplace interface, such as a computer
keyboard, musical keyboard, or mouse. This approach is
most palatable if the interfacematches the physicalmodel.
For instance, playing a virtual piano with amusical key-
board interface is physically intuitive, so it is easy for a pi-
anist to transfer real-life skills to the virtual domain. How-
ever, many performers play traditional acoustic instruments

lacking commonplace interface counterparts, so skill transfer
to the virtual domain is not as immediate [17].
1.1.2 Haptic Interfaces
Haptic interfaces lie at the opposite end of the complexity
spectrum.T h e y a p p l y f o r c e f e e d b a c k t o t h e p e r f o rmer, so
that he or she feels and interacts with the vibrations of the
virtual instrument as if the virtual instrument were real. In
this sense, haptic interfaces can be seen as the ideal inter-
face for interacting with virtual instruments. For instance, a
carefully designed haptic bowed-string should promote bet-
ter skill transfer to the virtual domain because it exerts
forces on the instrument interface causing it to behave as
if it were a real bow bowing a string.
When Luciani et al. implemented their haptic bowed string,
they found that users strongly preferred that haptic feed-
back be rendered at the audio rate of 44kHz rather than
at the usual 3kHz. Users made comments regarding the
“strong presence of the string in the hand,” “the string in
the ﬁngers,” and “the string is really here” [16]. Related
kinds of instruments, such as actively controlled acoustic
musical instruments are essentially the samea sh a p t i cmu-
sical instruments except that the whole acousticalmedium
becomes the interface [6]. Haptic technologies are becoming
increasingly available to themusic community, but they are
currently still complex enough that it is worth considering
alternatives.
1.1.3 Physically Motivated Interfaces
In this paper, we investigate themiddle ground in between
commonplace interfaces and haptic interfaces for controlling
physical models. We term such interfaces physically moti-
vated interfaces.R a t h e r t h a n a p p l y i n g h a p t i c f e e d b a c k , w e
attempt to otherwise preserve the physical interaction be-
tween the performer and the virtual instrument asmuch as
possible. Such interfaces are similar to Wanderley’s cate-
gorization of instrument-like controllers with one important
exception [17]: we state that the input quantities should be
sensed so accurately that an audio-rate feedback loop could
be closed around the sensor if the interface were equipped
with an actuator. It follows that ideally all quantities ap-
plied to the physicalmodel should:
• correspond to the correct quantity for controlling the
physical model (e.g. displacement, velocity, accelera-
tion, etc.)
• be linear and low-noise
• be delayed and ﬁltered as little as possible

• be sampled at the audio sampling rate
These requirements were diﬃcult tomeet in the past due to
limitations in computational power, A/D conversion, and
sensing; however, today we may achieve or approximate
them as we see ﬁt. To succeed in our endeavor, we need
to carefully apply knowledge from acoustics, mechanical en-
gineering, and electrical engineering to the ﬁeld of human
computer interaction. In the following, we develop a physi-
cally motivated interface for a virtual vibrating guitar string.
2. PRIOR GUITAR-LIKE INTERFACES
An umber of musical instrument interfaces suggest the
metaphor of a guitar. While they have followed diﬀerent
design goals, we should at least consider how they estimate
the desired pitch. For instance, the virtual air guitar uses
the distance between the hands to control the pitch. Diﬀer-
ent versions of the virtual air guitarmake use ofmagnetic
motion capture, camera tracking, and acoustic delay esti-
mation systemsf o rt h i smeasurement [12].
The makers of the GXtar prefer to place an force-sensing
resistor strip placed beneath a real string tomeasure both
the position and pressure [14]. The Ztar [2] and the Yamaha
EZ-GE [4] detect pitch with amatrix of sensors in the neck.
One sensing element is used for each fret and string. The
SynthAxe sports normal strings placed abovematrix-type
sensors [5]. The SynthAxe has additional sensors to detect
string bending. A current ﬂows down the each string, and
small electric coils placed near the stringmeasure the lateral
string displacement.
Roland provides a six-channel electromagnetic pickup for
electric guitar and accompanying DSP [3]. In the MIDI
mode of operation, a DSP estimates when new notes are
played, with what velocity, and with what pitch.1 One draw-
back of this approach in general is thatmost detectors have
noticeable delay for lower pitches because they wait at least
one period. It is also diﬃcult to construct a perfectly reliable
pitch detector of this type. Consequently, performers must
learn to play carefully to avoid confusing the pitch detector.
3. TANGIBLE GUITAR STRING
3.1 Separate Excitation Sensing and Pitch De-
tection
To ensure that the interface is physicallymotivated, we
follow the guidelines outlined in Section 1.1.3. We sense the
relevant portions of performer’s gestures with asmuch pre-
cision as possible to preserve the guitar-like physical inter-
action between the performer and the virtual instrument.
We would also like to preserve the physical presence of a
string. To these ends, an independent string segment asso-
ciated with each hand separates the problemso fe s t imating
the desired pitch andmeasuring the plucking excitation sig-
nal [5].
1In another mode of operation, the Roland system syn-
thesizes audio more directly from the sensed signals using
“Composite Object Sound Modeling”. Here the pitch detec-
tor is not needed explicitly, so tracking ismuch improved.
Since the model is not entirely virtual and its details are
trade secret, we do not consider it further here.

3.2 Signal Flow
The upper half of Figure 1 shows the signal ﬂow for the
pitch string segment; the purely acoustic components and
paths are drawn in dashed lines. We detect the desired pitch
of the string acoustically to help avoid incorrectly captur-
ing higher-order eﬀects such as string bending, slightlymis-
placed frets, etc. We actuate the string and measure its
response. Since we know how the string is being actuated,
we should be able tomore accurately estimate the length of
time it takes for a pulse to leave the actuator, reﬂect oﬀ of
af r e t ,a n da r r i v eb a c ka tt h es e n s o r( s e eF i g u r e2 ,t o p ) .
Any picking, plucking, scraping, or bowing excitation is
sensed via the excitation string segment and fed directly to
the virtual string.2 The lower half of Figure 1 shows the
signal ﬂow for the excitation string segment. One end of
the excitation string segment should be damped passively to
prevent physical resonances from interfering with resonances
in the virtualmodel (see the damping material in Figure 2,
bottom).
3.3 Two-Axis Digital Waveguide Virtual String
We model the virtual string using a simple two-axismodel
that takes into account the vertical and horizontal transverse
modes of vibration. The ith axis ismodeled using a delay
line of lengthNi samples and lowpass ﬁlterLPF i,w h i c hi s
a 3-tap linear-phase FIR ﬁlter causing the higher partials to
decay faster (see Figure 3). This portion is the basic digi-
tal waveguidemodel used for elementary teaching purposes
at CCRMA. For additional realism,t h ee x c i t a t i o ns i g n a l s
can be comb ﬁltered with the notch frequencies chosen as a
function of the excitation’s distance from the bridge [18].
While the nut is assumed to be rigid, the bridge is in
general not quite rigid, hence it couples the axes together at
this point. The coupling implemented in Figure 3 is actually
more appropriate formodeling the coupling of the vertical
axes of two neighboring piano strings, but it still results
2There are surprisingly few examples in the literature where
some ﬁltered form of an excitation signalmeasured at the
audio sampling rate appears at the output. One example is
the digital ﬂute, which allows the excitation signal asmea-
sured by amicrophone to bemixed with the sound synthesis
output; however, in contrast with the current work, sound
was not synthesized with a physicalmodel [19].

in qualitatively correct behavior. For instance, by choosing
N1 ≈ N2 such that N1 ̸= N2 and g ≈ 0.1, one obtains
behavior where the energy slowly rotates back and forth
between the axes of vibration [18] [15].
3.4 Prototype

in Figure 5. For convenience given the default hardware on a
Fender Stratocaster, the two string segments are spaced hor-
izontally instead of vertically in relation to one another. In a
six-stringed embodiment, each pair of string segments would
instead be placed axially-aligned with each other. In the
prototype, each string’s vibration is sensed using a Graph-
tech saddle piezoelectric pickup, as shown in Figure 4 [1].
Figure 4: Graphtech piezoelectric pickup
The magnetic actuator can be obtained by ordering the
Sustainiac [11]. It conveniently replaces any one of the
pickups; however, other kinds of actuators can be used in-
stead. To prevent the actuator from aﬀecting the excitation
string segment, we choose the excitation string segment to
be a regular, non-ferrous solid electrical wire. The excita-
tion string is passively damped using felt, wrapped in such
a manner to approximate gradually increasing the string’s
wave impedance to inﬁnity, eliminating reﬂections asmuch
as possible. In other words, the strip of felt is wrapped
more and more tightly approaching the nut (see Figure 5).
In somec a s e s ,i ti sb e t t e rt od ampt h es t r i n gl e s seﬀectively.
The resulting less damped reﬂections from the felt material
cause a comb-ﬁltering eﬀect, which changes the timbre of
the instrument as a function of excitation position as with a
normal vibrating string. Note that this desirable attribute
comes for free since the interface is physicallymotivated—
the combﬁ l t e rc a nb eimplemented either mechanically on
the interface or virtually in the instrument model.
3.4.1 Multi-Axis Pickups
To most accurately excite the physicalmodel, we should
ideally measure the excitation in both the horizontal and

vertical transverse axes of the string. This can be done us-
ing optical [10], electromagnetic, or piezoelectric sensors [8].
We have veriﬁed informally that the tangible virtual string
sounds more realistic given the two-dimensional excitation.

We have authored a website providing sound examples of
the instrument in a few diﬀerent conﬁgurations.3 For exam-
ple, the website includes comparisons ofmodel output given
randomly synthesized excitations, single axismeasured exci-
tations, and two-axismeasured excitations. It also includes

model output given various excitation sources such as pluck-

cite their physical models with quality excitation signals,
we provide the corresponding non-resonant excitation sig-
nals themselves. Finally, an example melody played on the
tangible virtual string demonstrates the viability of physi-
cally motivated instrument design.
5. FUTURE WORK
The behavior of the interface could be further reﬁned with
force-feedback. For example, the excitation string segment
could be made into a haptic device by adding an actuator.
Then the piece of physical string could be joined to a portion
of the waveguide using teleoperator techniques [9]. It would
be essential that the string segment would have as littlemass
as possible to avoid loading down the virtual waveguide at
the point of connection.We would also like to eventually con-
struct a six-string version to promote themaximum transfer
of guitarists’ skills from real guitars to virtual guitars.
6. CONCLUSION
We have presented a physicallymotivated interface for
controlling a virtual digital waveguide string. The excita-
tion and pitch are sensed separately using two independent
string segments. In contrast with prior interfaces, the exci-
tation to the physicalmodel is measured according to the
principles of physically motivated interfaces. In particular,
we measure the excitation signals with high quality, linear,
and low noise sensors at the audio sampling rate. We hope
that interfaces such as this one will continue to promote skill
transfer from traditional acousticmusical instruments to the
virtual domain.
