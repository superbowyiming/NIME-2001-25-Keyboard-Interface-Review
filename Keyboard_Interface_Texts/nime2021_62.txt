ABSTRACT
When two sounds are played at the same loudness, pitch, and duration, what sets them 
apart are their timbres. This study documents the design and implementation of the 
Timbre Explorer, a synthesizer interface based on efforts to dimensionalize this 
perceptual concept. The resulting prototype controls four perceptually salient 
dimensions of timbre in real-time: attack time, brightness, spectral flux, and spectral 
density. A graphical user interface supports user understanding with live visualizations 
of the effects of each dimension. The applications of this interface are three-fold; 
further perceptual timbre studies, usage as a practical shortcut for synthesizers, and 
educating users about the frequency domain, sound synthesis, and the concept of 
timbre. The project has since been expanded to a standalone version independent of a 
computer and a purely online web-audio version.

Introduction
Timbre is thought of as any auditory property other than pitch, duration, and loudness 
that allows two sounds to be distinguished [1]. This project sought to build on past 
research by implementing a synthesis model based on an aggregate theory of timbre. 
The result is the Timbre Explorer. Its applications are primarily educational purposes; 
to demonstrate theoretical timbral dimensions and provide an introduction to the 
synthesis of sounds. In addition, the Timbre Explorer combines visual and auditory 
learning to practically demonstrate the advanced concept of the frequency domain in 
an accessible way. It also functions as a performance instrument and will be used in 
studies to further our understanding of timbre.
Background
In the most popular approach for the study of timbre, multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) 
is used to construct a Euclidian space that best recreates a series of dissimilarity 
ratings between sounds as distances [1]. Across all timbre MDS studies, dimensions

related to “brightness” and temporal envelope have consistently been found [2]. Of the 
studies that found third or fourth dimensions, the acoustic correlates are not as 
consistent, but are usually spectral density (the power distribution of frequency 
components, see also even-odd harmonic distribution) and/or spectral flux. Earlier 
MDS studies more often found spectral flux as the third component but some timbre 
space synthesizers have instead found spectral density to be more salient [3]. 
Moreover, the number of dimensions derived is apparently influenced by the range of 
instruments used. No link has been found between participant background and the 
derived dimensions. Following from these findings of past timbre studies, the Timbre 
Explorer is controlled through 4 parameters: spectrum, brightness, articulation, and 
envelope.
Previous timbre space instruments have further influenced the design of the Timbre 
Explorer. Some of the earliest examples of these were the works of David Wessel who 
observed that “a timbre space could be used to specify perceivable timbral 
transpositions” [4]. The original Timbre Explorer design, seen in Figure 1, was 
inspired by the work of the Intuitive Sound Editing Environment [5], which ostensibly 
uses the same four dimensions. However, the Timbre Explorer has a much more 
simplified synthesis model to make it better suited for educational purposes. Usage of 
timbre spaces in education is also precedented by the Timbre Perception Test [6], a 
system with fewer dimensions and a smaller scope of purpose.
Timbre Explorer
The objective of this project was an introductory tool for the concept of timbre. To 
ground timbre in a familiar context, the Timbre Explorer needed to practically re-
create real instrument sounds while still fitting within the theoretical spaces proposed 
by MDS studies. For coherency, it was also important that these parameters should 
have a more or less continuous effect.

Synthesis Model
The spectrum parameter controls the base, unfiltered spectrum of the sound. 
Traversing spectrum values largely follows a transition from a sine wave to a square 
wave to a sawtooth; starting with the fundamental frequency, gradually adding odd-
harmonics, and then adding even ones. Brightness, experimentally correlated to 
spectral centroid [7], is recreated as a frequency filter. The filter is either low-pass or 
high-pass, depending on whether the parameter is low or high respectively. In both 
cases, the cutoff frequency directly scales with the parameter value, with the center as 
a neutral setting where the filter is not applied. Articulation controls the initial spectro-
temporal evolution of the timbre, accounting for the asynchrony in the rise of 
harmonics. Its implementation is a filter with a changing cutoff frequency, where the 
rate of change of the cutoff is affected by the parameter’s distance from the neutral 
center. Above the center, the filter is a high-pass with a decreasing cutoff, below it is a 
low-pass with an increasing cutoff. Similar to brightness, no effect is applied at the

center of the range. Lastly, the envelope parameter controls the temporal amplitude 
envelope, based on the Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release (ADSR) paradigm. The 
envelope value primarily affects the attack time. At low envelope values, attack time is 
at a minimum to emulate percussive sounds, and at a maximum at high values for 
sounds with softer onsets. Altogether, these dimensions as listed form a consecutive 
signal chain: the signal starts as a waveform determined by the spectrum, which is 
then filtered by the brightness and then the articulation filters. The final effect is a 
gain that follows the envelope’s ADSR profile. The result is an extremely flexible 
system capable of synthesizing a wide range of sounds and recognizably mimicking 
various instruments. Its modular code design is shown in Figure 2. The Timbre 
Explorer achieves what typically requires a dizzying array of ranges and settings using 
just four continuous parameters.
Interface Design
Several versions of the Timbre Explorer have been implemented for different purposes. 
Of these, an important component is the graphical user interface (GUI), which 
provides live visual feedback and information about the current timbre settings. 
Central to the the GUI is the informational block diagram (IBD), which demonstrates 
the simplicity of the synthesis model. Each “block” corresponds to a dimension, and 
also displays a relevant real-world graph of numerical behavior that reacts in real time 
to reflect changes in the dimension values. In order, the spectrum graph displays the 
Fourier transform of the base waveform, the brightness shows its filter’s frequency 
response function, the articulation graphs how its cutoff frequency changes over time, 
and the envelope graphs the ADSR’s amplitude over time. A final, fifth block diagram 
element shows the live result of an FFT of the output sound, visualizing the combined 
effect of the four dimensions. This IBD is the key to introducing unfamiliar users to the

frequency domain; they can visually observe how the frequency spectrum changes and, 
through audio, implicitly learn how it differentiates different timbres.
The hardware and the GUI varies between the different versions of the Timbre 
Explorer. The original Timbre Explorer controls the four timbre parameters with two 2-
dimensional touch surfaces, with a MIDI keyboard to trigger notes. It can also be 
connected to a computer to display an in-browser GUI (Figure 3) that reflects the last-
touched position of the touch sensors and the IBD. In addition, this version’s GUI also 
features advanced synthesis controls that go beyond the constraints of the 4-
parameter system. These advanced controls serve to offer a form of progression for 
users new to synthesis, while also acting as tools to be used by experts to better tune 
the timbre they desire. At the heart of this prototype is a Bela microcontroller, which 
handles hardware IO and runs both the C++ signal processing code and the Javascript 
GUI code.
A standalone version with four knobs instead of 2D touch surfaces has also been 
designed to be more compact and used independently of a computer. An enclosure is 
currently lacking and will be part of future work.

The third version is the opposite of the standalone, a fully online website implemented 
in Javascript with web-audio API. A screenshot is shown in Figure 4. The parameters 
are controlled with four separate range elements and notes are triggered using the 
computer keyboard as a piano roll. This version has a stable prototype but other 
features including data collection are planned. Another planned feature is saving 
sounds to be used as stimuli in other research. This version will be used in an online 
gamified user study, planned for this summer, to test the salience of the dimensions 
and collect feedback for future improvements. The user study will also verify whether 
using the Timbre Explorer aids in understanding the concepts of timbre, the frequency 
domain, and sound synthesis.
Conclusions
The Timbre Explorer is a practical implementation of theorized timbre spaces. Users 
navigate a 4-dimensional space that changes the sound's spectrum, brightness, 
articulation, and envelope. The functionality and educative potential is greatly 
enhanced by the graphical user interface. Video demonstrations of the original

ubiquitously useful frequency domain.
