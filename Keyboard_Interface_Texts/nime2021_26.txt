ABSTRACT
The nature of digital musical instruments (DMIs), often bespoke artefacts devised by 
single or small groups of technologists, requires thought about how they are shared 
and archived so that others can replicate or adapt designs. The ability for replication 
contributes to an instrument’s longevity and creates opportunities for both DMI 
designers and researchers. Research papers often omit necessary knowledge for 
replicating research artefacts, but we argue that mitigating this situation is not just 
about including design materials and documentation. Our way of approaching this 
issue is by drawing on an age-old method as a way of disseminating knowledge, the 
apprenticeship. We propose the DMI apprenticeship as a way of exploring the 
procedural  obstacles of replicating DMIs, while highlighting for both apprentice and 
designer the elements of knowledge that are a challenge to communicate in 
conventional documentation. Our own engagement with the DMI apprenticeship led to 
successfully replicating an instrument, Strummi. Framing this process as an 
apprenticeship highlighted the non-obvious areas of the documentation and 
manufacturing process that are crucial in the successful replication of a DMI.

Introduction
The nature of digital musical instruments (DMIs), often bespoke artefacts devised by 
single or small groups of technologists, requires thought about how they are shared 
and archived so that others can replicate or adapt designs. The ability for replication 
contributes to an instrument’s longevity and creates opportunities for both DMI 
designers and researchers. Designers are then able to be inspired by and repurpose 
parts of the design of shared DMIs, while researchers are able to replicate the 
scientific studies that employ DMIs if those instruments can also be replicated.

In NIME, and HCI at large, there are facets of knowledge that are omitted from 
research papers. This often includes the materials and documentation necessary for 
replicating research artefacts. However, we argue in this paper that it is not enough to 
provide design materials and documentation to be able to replicate a physical artefact, 
that there are types of knowledge also omitted from these materials. In response, we 
draw on an age-old method as a way of disseminating knowledge, the apprenticeship. 
We propose the DMI apprenticeship as a way of exploring the procedural obstacles to 
replicating DMIs, while highlighting the elements of knowledge that are difficult to 
communicate in conventional documentation.
We are motivated to provide a pathway for designers and makers to document their 
designs in a way that others can build upon and improve. At the same time, we raise 
the issue of communicating tacit knowledge and expertise that DMI designers may 
take for granted, and which tend to be omitted from publications and instrument 
documentation. In doing this, we hope to promote the longevity of instruments created 
by our community and contribute to the dissemination of instrument-making 
knowledge. While some instruments may benefit from the mystique of existing as the  
result of a unique set of decisions, replicability is a common enough  concern for DMI 
practitioners who see the benefit of having open  designs.
To explore these aspects, we have embarked on a method we call DMI apprenticeship, 
which consists of having an apprentice replicate a DMI design with direct instruction 
from its designers. In addition, we have reflected on the sharing and replicating 
process from the viewpoints of the designers and apprentice. By apprentice, we mean 
somebody with a skillset suitable for DMI design but without specific knowledge about 
the instrument at hand. This person need not be a master craftsperson, as we are not 
seeking a peer review of the design for its improvement. Although there is value in the 
training relationship of this exercise, for the purposes of this paper, we are more 
interested in the replication aspect of the apprenticeship than the directional transfer 
of knowledge. The DMI apprenticeship serves as a way of uncovering every detail of 
the instrument build process, to jointly put together a set of documentation for the 
DMI.
Some questions we are concerned with and which are explored in this paper are: What 
are the procedural obstacles of having someone other than the designer(s) replicate a 
DMI? What should the roles of designer and apprentice in co-creating documentation 
be? What do the inefficiencies of replicating a DMI tell us about the nature of the 
instrument?

We propose that this paper, and the DMI apprenticeship method outlined in it, will be 
useful for DMI researchers concerned with the implications of reproducible science 
involving DMIs, designers and makers interested in promoting the longevity of their 
instruments, those in the NIME community looking for richer ways of developing an 
instrument making practice, and organisations that want to share and document the 
output of instruments from their research and development programmes.
In the next section, we draw on related work to provide the context for why we care 
about DMI longevity, sharing, replication, and the relevance of craft knowledge for 
digital lutherie. We will then describe the instrument we replicated and documented, 
Strummi,  including an overview of the research which has been conducted with it. 
Following that, we will outline the method we followed and which we propose as the 
DMI apprenticeship. Next, we provide first-person reflections on the process of 
sharing and replication from the viewpoints of the designers and apprentice. In 
addition, we discuss some of the salient points that emerged from our reflections and 
review the reasons why we recommend the DMI apprenticeship as a method for others 
to adopt. Finally, we summarise our contributions and offer some conclusions.
Related Work
There is a prevalent feeling, especially in the NIME community, that DMIs do not reach 
longevity and are often abandoned soon after completion [1][2]. Also, it has been 
recognised that there are challenges to maintaining, sharing and documenting existing 
DMIs [3][4]. Some of these challenges are not exclusive to DMIs, as the documentation 
of hardware-software codependencies applies to a wide range of projects.
In 2017, Morreale and McPherson [1] presented the results of a survey that 
investigated the difficulties of DMIs establishing themselves after creation and 
elaborated on the factors that influence the successes and failures of previous DMIs 
(presented at NIME 2010-14). The study showed that very few DMIs are performed in 
public and are often limited to one user, who tends to be the designer. Furthermore, it 
found that almost half of DMIs were not at that time ready for performance, with two 
thirds of those requiring substantial work to be ready. Marquez-Borbon and Martinez-
Avila [2] related this lack of performance development of DMIs with community 
building and learnability of instruments. Their paper calls for the need of repertoire 
and pedagogical strategies as well as following a Community of Practice model in 
order to address the longevity of instruments.

One way of promoting the longevity of an instrument is by sharing it, as this can mean 
that several people can maintain the project by working on it asynchronously and that 
it can be replicated throughout the world, opening it up to different contexts and 
cultures, through the development of performances by musicians worldwide. However, 
the process of sharing a DMI is not as straightforward as a software project.
Calegario et al. [4] present a detailed account of the level of information that should be 
covered by a DMI's documentation and discuss the challenges of sharing DMIs. They 
state that a number of aspects including mechanical structure, electronics, 
programming, mapping and sound design should be addressed in a DMI's 
documentation, and that this should consolidate project assets, working prototypes, 
general notes and audiovisual records. They describe the documentation process as 
"an empathy exercise, since the design team must put themselves into the maker's 
position, considering their possible lack of specific skills, mistakes, 
misinterpretations". The authors go on to propose future work in developing an Open 
Source Hardware certification for DMIs.
In 2016, a NIME workshop [5] was held to explore the creation of a community 
database of DMIs (NIMEhub) as a way of expanding the reproducible research 
practices of NIME. The objective was to harness internet resources to enable 
instrument components to be more rapidly designed, manufactured, and evaluated, by 
sharing their designs across the world. The workshop identified the lack of 
comprehensive documentation for instrument designs emerging from NIME and non-
affiliated makers and artists. This leads to the duplication of effort for designers 
working on similar challenges, as well as to a hindrance of instrument longevity. Some 
of the benefits of NIMEhub would be to provide NIME designers with an assortment of 
designs to learn from and be inspired by, enable the modularity of designs, facilitate 
collaboration, allowing older designs to be updated with newer technologies, etc.
While certainly not specific to NIME or DMIs, there is a variety of communities and 
online platforms that support the sharing and archiving of physical artefacts, such as 
Hackster.io, Thingiverse or Hackaday.io, and popular software repositories such as 
GitHub or GitLab are often used to host digital design files as well as code. Also, 
platforms like Instructables host a community around online step-by-step tutorials. All 
of these platforms have become an integral part of the open-source model of software 
development. How are these resources used by the HCI community?
In [6], Echtler and Häußler recognise a replication crisis within HCI, and attribute this 
to a lack of engagement with the open-source model of software development. They

argue that sharing data and source code should be an integral part of publishing 
papers, thereby adopting a more open stance. 
However, sharing physical artefacts and how they are made is not as straightforward 
as sharing code. Unlike software, physical objects need to be specified through 2D or 
3D drawings, and, as discussed in this paper, there is an element of tacit knowledge 
implicit in the building of artefacts. This creates obstacles in the open sourcing of 
hardware products. To address this issue, Bonvoisin et al. [7] ask themselves what the 
‘source’ of open source hardware is, i.e. what project materials must be shared for an 
artefact to become open source. To explore this question, they analysed the 
documentation of a variety of hardware products and found a wide range of sharing 
practices, from CAD files to the publication of comprehensive documentation.
An aspect of physical artefact replication that we want to explore in this paper relates 
to the skills needed to reproduce a physical object. Someone replicating a physical 
artefact not only needs documentation, tools and infrastructure, but must learn the 
‘craft’ relating to that artefact. Torrey et al. argue that craft “experts’ skills are deeply 
embedded in their physical movements and in their history of interaction with 
materials, making this knowledge difficult to express” [8](p.1371). New vocabulary is 
easier to learn when both master1 and apprentice are present and can point to certain 
features of an artefact [8]. Knowledge is acquired by observing a master craftsperson, 
developing vocabulary to refer to the artefact and mediate feedback, and by building 
up continued experience with techniques and materials.
Gamble [9]  traces back the evolution of the apprenticeship, arguing that there is  still 
value in it, even though it has become an anachronism. Despite the  changes in the 
content and form of apprenticeships, craft knowledge  still requires that it is passed on 
through a ‘modelling’ relationship  between master and apprentice. This is due to the 
tacit nature of craft  knowledge.
The Internet offers many avenues for a craftsperson to share their knowledge and for 
craft enthusiasts to learn skills, communicate with others for advice and feedback, and 
even make their crafts available for sale. However, it is unclear to what extent 
craft/tacit knowledge can really be transmitted through online means [10].
In a study on How-To pages, Torrey et al. [11]  identify that communicating how 
something is done is a non-trivial task, especially when referring to manipulating 
physical objects. When studying computer and electronics hobbyists, they found that 
they used  technologies such as video and 3D modelling software to communicate  
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression DMI Apprenticeship: Sharing and Replicating Musical Artefacts
7
process knowledge. This makes sense due to the challenge of documenting  procedural 
knowledge in text-based form. Furthermore, in the activities of these hobbyists, they 
found that knowledge retrieval and creation were largely mediated by the How-Tos, 
whereas exchange happened on the side of documentation.
Strummi
Strummi (Figure 1) is a guitar-inspired DMI which uses the acoustic waveform 
generated from plucking dampened lengths of guitar string to excite a Karplus-Strong 
algorithm running on the Bela platform [12]. It has six physical strings, each of which 
excite a separate iteration of the algorithm (or 'virtual string'). By tuning the virtual 
strings to the notes of a typical guitar chord voicing, the strings can be strummed or 
plucked in a way which generates a strikingly realistic approximation of an acoustic 
string instrument, due to the preservation of the acoustic signal produced by the 
physical strings. This is a technique that has been used in other similar instruments 
such as the Kalichord Strum2, BladeAxe [13] and VASPBI [14]. Different chord voicings 
can be selected using embedded push-buttons, resulting in a functionality similar to 
that of an Autoharp or Omnichord. 
The design of Strummi originally came about through experimenting with methods of 
preserving the nuances of plucked string performances in DMIs. With no specific

research questions in mind, the second and third authors spent some time iterating 
over designs based on acoustic excitation of the Karplus-Strong algorithm [15]. These 
early prototypes began as thumb-piano like instruments with wooden tines clamped 
over piezo sensors (Figure 2), with the output of the sensors used as the excitation for 
the virtual strings. We then began exploring ways of incorporating real guitar strings 
into the physical design in order to maintain some familiar plucking and strumming 
techniques, resulting in several iterations based on this idea (Figure 3).

The second and third authors saw potential in these early prototypes to support our 
research interests: the nature of touch and control intimacy in DMIs, and the role of 
interaction technique and cultural form in establishing an instrument's identity. These 
research goals lead to the first stable designs of Strummi, which are presented in [16] 
and [17]. The materials and aesthetic qualities of the instrument were informed by our 
research goal of creating different versions of the instrument with more-or-less "guitar-
like" qualities. A follow-up study was concerned with Strummi's potential as an 
Accessible Digital Musical Instrument (ADMI), and resulted in a second iteration of 
various Strummi designs. This second iteration saw some of the usability issues of the 
original design resolved, as well as a maturation of our ideas around the Strummi as a 
research product, which are detailed in [18]. The Strummi continues to be used in 
ADMI studies, some of which are presented in [19] and [20].
Method
In this section, we will set out the different phases of the apprenticeship project. In 
this paper, the designers are the second and third authors, while the apprentice is the 
first author. All communications between designers and apprentice were recorded.
The preparation phase of the apprenticeship began with the designers putting together 
a project snapshot [4] consisting of a bill of materials, project assets including code 
and fabrication files, a working prototype and general notes. Then, the designers and

apprentice held a teardown session (Figure 4) to disassemble the DMI, in order to 
confirm the bill of materials and demonstrate the assembly of the instrument. Finally, 
the apprentice ordered and gathered the materials for fabrication.
The making phase consisted of three main activities. First, the building of the 
enclosure and strings was carried out, under guidance of the designers. Second, the 
electronics were put together. The custom PCB was assembled, along with the 
components for the buttons. Third, the code was implemented by importing the 
software on Bela. During these activities, and already from the preparation phase, the 
apprentice kept a craft log book to keep track of inefficiencies, mistakes and 
challenges to making the instrument.
The next phase involved looking back at the craft log book and putting together 
documentation for public use, which gives detail about constructing the instrument, 
including advice based on the knowledge acquired during the making phase. The 
documentation includes three levels: a story outlining what the instrument is and how 
it is being used, a recipe describing how to make the instrument step-by-step, and a 
repository hosting the necessary design files and code. The recipe was produced in 
three passes by the designers and apprentice, verifying that the steps were described 
in sufficient detail.
Once the instrument was replicated and the documentation completed, the designers 
and apprentice reflected on the process. These are inherently subjective accounts, 
partly based on the recordings and craft log book, and not a detached third-party 
analysis of the recorded data. Both reflections can be found in the next section.

Reflection
Designers’ Reflection
Handing over an instrument design to another person requires you to first and 
foremost commit to a final revision and to pause development. This was a tricky task in 
itself for us, given the varied forms that Strummi evolved through before this final 
form was reached.
Designing an instrument is a process of experimenting with different techniques of 
material, electronics and sound design. It is a process of reiterating through many 
prototypes to perfect small details of the design, while gradually covering up any 
traces of this experimentation. This happens in both the physical instrument and its 
code base. As an instrument design reaches its point of arrival, whatever that may be, 
the majority of the processes which brought about that particular design get hidden in 
the polish of the “designed” product.
In earlier prototypes, the signs of these processes of trial and error tend to be more 
visible in the artefact itself. When passing on an instrument design to a person who 
has not lived through the whole design process, there are many instances of decision 
making and design choices which can appear to lack the extensive reasoning that 
brought them about in the first place. During this apprenticeship process we tried our 
best to find ways to communicate some of the reasoning behind design decisions, 
where appropriate.
The fact this instrument was a joint effort in the first place made things easier, as we 
had already settled on loose naming conventions for the different modules which make 
up the instrument. These naming conventions developed from the necessity for us to 
talk through the designs as we were working and were further developed throughout 
the apprenticeship process and have been carried throughout the labelling of design 
files and commenting of code.
Repositories of design files and code were used as a means of keeping track of and 
sharing our design ideas. They were not meant to be instructive, so lacked in 
accompanying documentation, which made things tricky to piece together when 
working with the apprentice. Making custom designed PCBs available for easy order 
via a service such as OSH Park would also make this instrument design far more 
accessible for those without experience with PCB fab houses. Our process was 
definitely helped by being able to be in person and hands on with the apprentice.

12
Disassembling the working prototype was a crucial step which is most likely not 
possible for most instrument recreations. Finding a digital alternative is important, 
whether video, photos or an exploded view digital model. 
As an instrument which came together somewhat organically through experimentation 
and trial-and-error before being formalised as a research product, many of the 
decisions that led to the way that the Strummi is put together are non-obvious and 
under-documented. We noticed during the apprenticeship process that the "why" 
behind many design steps was just as important to communicate as the "what" and the 
"how". Things that were fairly obvious to us designers, as a result of the tacit 
understanding of the way all the constituent parts came together, were much less 
obvious to the apprentice. Decisions that may have been made verbally and informally 
several years ago were now under much closer scrutiny, and led us at several stages to 
ask ourselves "why did we do it that way?". Documenting and communicating the 
"why" behind a certain design step may not be such a crucial part of the process of 
building future versions, however communicating the intentions behind them as well 
as the process of carrying them out, may aid the longevity of the design through 
enabling maintenance and design remixing of the instrument.
Apprentice’s Reflection
At the onset of the project, replicating Strummi was an intimidating task, especially 
without comprehensive documentation for it. However, I counted on the designers’ 
expertise to help me learn to make it. This expertise included high-level theory about 
the instrument;  the practical know-what, i.e. the necessary steps; and the know-how, 
i.e. tacit elements of knowledge about how to make the DMI.
While on some sessions, I was accompanied by the designers, others had to be held 
remotely. I found this had both advantages and disadvantages. While the know-what 
was mostly clear, I lacked the know-how to carry out some steps. This led to making 
mistakes, which cost hours of labour. However, it was positive to find these mistakes, 
which we saw as opportunities to adjust the design, or warn potential makers of the 
instrument of these challenging and problematic points. On the other hand, having the 
designers available to demonstrate, correct or supervise me felt supportive, but in 
some instances I did not learn how to take a step, since I was merely copying or 
observing the designers.
I encountered many hurdles along the way, but finding these has allowed us to 
highlight them to others, as well as leading to a better understanding of the design of 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression DMI Apprenticeship: Sharing and Replicating Musical Artefacts
13
the instrument. Something that may be common with other open-source projects is 
that the repository had not been properly maintained, which meant some of the design 
files and code needed for making the instrument were either missing or not up-to-date.
Another hurdle relates to the affordances of assembling parts. While the precise 
mistake that led to this learning point has been corrected in the latest version of 
Strummi, i.e. there was an error in the symmetry of the design files, we learned that 
parts should, whenever possible, only be able to fit in one way, the correct way.
The fact that laser-cut parts were numbered helped with their assembly and figuring 
out how to put them together correctly, as they could be physically put together in 
more than one way. This kind of annotation could be considered as the hardware 
counterpart to code comments. We recognised this could have been done more 
extensively, as I still needed the designers to specify the order in which some parts 
were to be assembled. As for code comments, I lacked an explanation for 
troubleshooting the button order, a step needed since the buttons were not wired how 
the code expected them. Again, this is something specific to Strummi, but any DMI 
should specify, in its code, any necessary steps to be taken for its correct functioning.
A step that went smoothly, despite not having the designers present, was assembling 
the components of the custom PCB. Many DMIs will have a custom circuitry. While one 
would typically need a list of components and values, as well as a diagram of the board 
design, I went off a picture of an assembled PCB (from the teardown) and had enough 
knowledge of the circuit to know which value components went in different places. The 
reason why this was straightforward is because replicating PCBs is a largely 
standardised process, which follows a ‘paint by numbers’ process when populating 
them with components in accordance to schematics.
Something I was interested in was how different parts of the instrument could be 
modularised and repurposed, to make a different version of the instrument, or a new 
instrument inspired by it. Although this was not straightaway clear when replicating 
the instrument, in the process of producing the step-by-step recipe in the 
documentation, we clearly divided steps in a way that one can understand how to 
extract parts of the design or modify others.
One of the most salient points of shared tacit knowledge was when the designer 
disassembled one of the strings and demonstrated how to achieve the optimal tension 
in the string. Achieving this requires that one plucks the string repeatedly while 
tightening it in order to get both a feel of the string and to make sure it is not

14
producing an audible tone. While this is specific to string instruments, one should 
think about what elements of making their instrument require this aspect of ‘feeling 
the materials’.
Discussion
As we have seen, despite there being multiple papers published about Strummi, there 
are levels of knowledge related to it which have not been communicated. Arguably, this 
is true for a majority of instrument-related research papers. The reason is that, often, 
these papers focus on the knowledge that has come about from using these 
instruments and not on the instrument development itself. This is for a good reason, 
since other academics will be interested in what they can learn from a paper’s 
methodology or findings, and perhaps not so much in the specifics of how an 
instrument has been designed and constructed. Nonetheless, it is important for DMI 
designers that their instruments have longevity, and one aspect of this will be related 
to how the instrument is shared and documented. For this reason, some authors 
publish supplementary materials that include design files and documentation to 
replicate their instrument. However, as we have found by engaging with the DMI 
apprenticeship method, there are elements of the practical know-how of 
manufacturing a physical artefact that are not easily communicated through 
documentation.
By drawing on this age-old method for disseminating knowledge, we have engaged 
with the process of replication in a way that highlights the elements of tacit knowledge 
that exist in digital lutherie. In fact, this process not only uncovers tacit knowledge, 
e.g. how strings should be tightened to feel a certain way, but establishes a modelling 
relationship between the designers, who know what is an appropriate outcome for the 
instrument, and apprentice, who can help to identify the procedural obstacles of 
replicating the instrument due to their position of unknowing.
An apprenticeship is different to a peer review of the instrument because we are not 
seeking to actively improve the instrument but to produce an exact copy of it. Being an 
apprentice is also different to following a step-by-step tutorial, for example via the 
Instructables platform. The obvious difference is that as an apprentice, you have direct 
access to the designer’s expertise, whether that is high-level theory about the 
instrument, practical know-what of the steps and materials needed or practical know-
how of how the materials should be manipulated. Another difference is that, as an 
apprentice, you are contributing to the process of making an artefact ready for mass 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression DMI Apprenticeship: Sharing and Replicating Musical Artefacts
15
consumption, as the artefact can be documented with the apprentice's contributions. 
In this light, a DMI apprenticeship can serve as a beneficial step between the one-off 
instrument and the publication of the instrument for others to replicate, which can 
happen through open-sourcing or a step-by-step tutorial. Online step-by-step tutorials 
work, as is evidenced by huge and vibrant communities where people successfully 
replicate others’ artefacts. However, we ask ourselves how people bridge the gaps in 
knowledge found in recipes.
An idea emerged, from our reflections, about what the ideal apprenticeship exercise is. 
We considered the DMI apprenticeship as a method towards making public 
documentation. Furthermore, we acknowledged how our process, through the 
inefficiencies of replication, taught us a lot about the instrument. Therefore, we 
describe the apprenticeship as a method for both developing an instrument making 
practice and for coming up with richer ways of communicating design information. We 
found that it would be positive to add a stage to our method, to have a pilot replicator 
use the documentation resulting from the apprenticeship, to find out whether they are 
able to replicate the instrument without the designers’ presence. They would report 
back on any gaps in either the description of the instrument, its recipe or repository. 
These gaps might be addressed by simple edits to the documentation but it could also 
emerge that what is missing is a modelling relationship with the designers, as in the 
apprenticeship.
 The need for certain skills, tools and infrastructure as a pre-requirement for making a 
physical artefact is another important aspect of DMI replication. In our case, as part of 
the same university department, both designers and apprentice had access to the same 
tools and had similar experience using them. Furthermore, the apprentice had a 
design background. Perhaps this is where the DMI apprenticeship most differs from 
the abstract apprenticeship, i.e. the DMI apprentice already has the required skills but 
learns how to apply them to the replication of a specific instrument.
Our own engagement with the DMI apprenticeship led to successfully replicating an 
instrument, Strummi3, while showing an opportunity for revising the design. Framing 
this process as an apprenticeship highlighted the non-obvious areas of the 
documentation and manufacturing process that are crucial in the successful 
replication of DMIs. For this reason, we recommend the DMI apprenticeship to 
instrument designers who want to promote their instruments' longevity, as the method 
will be able to highlight important aspects to focus on when producing materials such

16
as recipes or repositories, as well as elements of lutherie knowledge that are beyond 
documentation.
Conclusion
We set out to replicate an existing instrument by framing it as a DMI apprenticeship, 
so the designers of the DMI taught an apprentice how to make their instrument. This 
process, supported by a craft log book, served as a method for developing 
comprehensive documentation and promote the instrument’s longevity. In this process, 
we engaged with the different strata of knowledge involved in replicating physical 
artefacts and looked for the elements of knowledge that cannot be communicated in 
research publications or documentation.
We described and reflected on our process for replication from the viewpoints of 
designer and apprentice as a way of presenting how knowledge was exchanged, 
extracting what was learned about the instrument and discussing what learning points 
can be extrapolated to other projects.
Finally, we discussed the results, and made a recommendation for DMI designers to 
engage with the DMI apprenticeship process when producing documentation for their 
instruments. Our conclusion is that the DMI apprenticeship should be adopted by 
NIME, as it is a method which provides a richer way of developing an instrument 
making practice, while giving us a better understanding of our instruments.
Future work will look into other designers' approaches to replicating and documenting 
their instruments ‘in the wild’, and how they approach the challenge of disseminating 
the tacit knowledge involved in instrument making.
