ABSTRACT
Standard guitar effects pedals are limited in their control
possibilities, difficult to access on stage, and challenging to
operate while playing. Innovative control systems are often
not well integrated into the common guitar playing envi-
ronment. In this paper we present “Dextoria” – a control
system that allows guitarists to make additional use of their
sound-producing hand gestures. With the fretting hand,
guitarists can switch between two effect loops, depending
on the hand’s fret position that is measured by a distance
sensor on the guitar’s headstock. The posture of the pick-
ing/strumming hand is captured by an IMU sensor on a
hand strap, in order to control guitar effects pedals that
have an expression input. The Dextoria system is modular
and embeds into guitarists’ existing live setups.

1. INTRODUCTION
The electric guitar has a long tradition as augmented in-
strument (also referred to as extended or hybrid instrument
[13]). As guitarists have both hands involved in the sound
production, control of all additional sound extensions can

only be achieved by resorting to peripheral aspects of gui-
tar playing [9]. Therefore, among conventional guitar play-
ers, floor-based controllers are still the predominant choice
– for discrete effect changes as well as for expressive con-
trols [8]. Along with the increase of sonic possibilities and
corresponding control interfaces, playing the instrument has
become increasingly complex [10]. In order to avoid exceed-
ing the physical and mental capabilities of guitar players,
most control interfaces for electric guitar have been con-
ceived with simplicity in mind, featuring relatively simple
controls and traditionally being conveniently placed within
the guitarist’s reach (typically, an effects pedal that is dis-
/activated by stepping on it).
However, effects pedals also come with shortcomings. H¨odl
& Fitzpatrick [5] state that effects pedals are highly limited
in their actual control possibilities, often only offering push
buttons and no gestural or other, more embodied control
options. Moreover, Konovalovs et al. [7] criticize their sta-
tionary nature, forcing guitar players to return to their ef-
fects pedal board to switch effects on/off or even having to
kneel and reach down to change settings.
Several research projects have addressed these problems
and set out to develop mitigating systems. While some
of them succeeded to provide guitarists with real-time and
more intuitive effect controls, they do not appear to be well
integrated into the typical ecology of guitarists. For exam-
ple, some projects force guitarists to interrupt their play-
ing movements to access and handle new control interfaces
[5, 12]. Other studies require guitarists to learn and per-
form unfamiliar or unconventional movements which may
add another level of complexity [11, 7, 2]. Finally, virtually
all comparable projects we found rely on personal comput-
ers and/or are restricted to specifically programmed effects.
The conventional (live) guitar rig, however, tends to con-
sist of a guitar going through various effects pedals into an
amplifier. Requiring guitarists to incorporate laptops into
their effects chain therefore constitutes an intrusion into
their natural playing environment.
2. THE DEXTORIA OBJECTIVE
The idea for Dextoria was to develop a system that allows to
register the sound-producing gestures [6] of both the fretting
hand and the picking/strumming hand, respectively, which
are performed during playing, and to use it for extending the
sonic control possibilities of the electric guitar. These kinds
of gestures are chosen because guitarists are already familiar
with them and do not need to learn them anew so that a
high degree of intimacy [4] can be assumed. Furthermore,
as they are performed anyways, guitarists do not need to
focus on other, potentially distracting, gestures during their
performances.
To ensure integration into guitarists’ live setups, the de-
veloped system should not rely on computers and not be re-
stricted to specifically programmed audio effects. Instead,
it was conceived to integrate well (plug & play) with off-
the-shelf (guitar) effects pedals.
The design of the Dextoria system has been influenced
by two concepts relating to music and the design of new
musical instruments and controllers, i.e., musical gestures
and intimacy.
As Dextoria should be integrated into the environment
of guitarists, typical (live) guitar setups and playing tech-
niques were explored. The findings are based on literature,
a survey of online sales rankings 1 (types of electric gui-
tars and effects pedals), and our own informal testing of
the prototype.
• Electric guitars
Our survey showed that the prototype needs to work with
Fender Stratocaster and Telecaster as well as Gibson Les
Paul guitars, as well as any other guitars from different
brands that are modeled after these, to ensure integrabil-
ity in as many guitarists’ setups as possible. The head-
stock design of the electric guitar models is of special
importance as the sensor of the fret-hand setup must be
fitted onto the headstock.
• Effects pedals
The typical ecology of guitarists includes an ample num-
ber of effects pedals. It is therefore important that Dex-
toria is compatible with this wide array of effects pedals
and thus easy to integrate in existing setups. The fret-
hand setup can be used in conjuncture with all guitar
effects in various constellations. The pick-hand setup is
compatible to pedals with expression pedal input.
• Amplifiers
As Dextoria focuses on what is happening with the gui-
tar signal before entering the amplifier, it works with any
kind of amplifier. It is much more important to empha-
size that guitar players still use amps and renounce using
computers in their live setup.
3. DEXTORIA’S FUNCTIONALITY
The Dextoria system is made up of two setups, one for the
fretting hand and one for the picking/strumming hand, as
shown in Fig. 1 and named fret-hand and pick-hand setup,
respectively. Both setups use two ESP32 microcontrollers
each, programmed by using the Arduino Integrated Devel-
opment Environment. ESP-NOW [3], a wireless commu-
nication protocol, was selected for data transmission. The
Arduino source code and electronics schematics are shared
in a public repository [1].
To better convey the capabilities of Dextoria, two short
demonstration videos were made, a fret-hand demo 2 and a
pick-hand demo3.
3.1 Fret-hand setup
The fret-hand setup allows guitar players to switch between
two effects loops according to the position of the fretting
hand along the guitar’s neck. The setup consists of two

components, the Scout (see Fig. 1(a)) and the Mothership
(depicted there in the corner).
The Scout is attached to the headstock of the guitar and
can detect the fret position of the fretting hand. It com-
prises an optical Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor, an ESP32
microcontroller as well as a custom-made attachment de-
vice. The ToF model chosen for this project is a VL531X
on a breakout board manufactured by Blue Dot.
The attachment solution consists of a mount, originally
designed for cameras, that was slightly adapted to hold the
ToF sensor and ESP32. It can be clamped onto the head-
stock and, subsequently, adjusted to place the ToF sensor
in the correct position. While it is flexible enough to fit
onto common guitar headstocks of brands like Fender and
Gibson, it is at the same time sturdy enough to maintain
its true position while the headstock is moved during per-
formance.
The Mothership is designed to sit on a pedalboard, next
to the effects pedals. It splits the incoming guitar signal
into two effect loops and switches between them according
to the signals received by the Scout.
It is comprised of another ESP32 as well as several small
electronic circuits, namely a buffer/splitter and a mixer that
is controlled by a digital potentiometer MCP4251. Further-
more, the Mothership features a small OLED display and
a rotary knob to set the fret threshold. All its components
are housed in a box in the shape of a large effects pedal with
a main input jack, send and return jacks for each effect loop
as well as a main output jack.
The Scout uses the ToF sensor to measure the distance
from the guitar’s nut to the fretting hand. The distance
data obtained is used to calculate the corresponding fret
position of the fretting hand. To convert the distance mea-
surements into the corresponding fret number k, Eq. 1(a)
was used:
k = 12 · log2
L0
L0 + ∆Lk
(1a)
with the scale length L0, the distance ∆ Lk from nut to
finger/fret,
∆Lk = Lk − L0, (1b)
and the string length Lk at fret k,
Lk = L0 · 2−k/12. (1c)
Since a guitar player’s fingers are always between the area
of two frets, a range of a fret can be defined by the upper
value being the fret distance of fret k and the lower value
being the fret distance of fretk−1, see Fig. 2. Following this
principle, fret ranges were defined. Slight, manual adjust-
ment was necessary when working with the actual setup.
Currently, the prototype detects frets from one to nine ac-
curately, with guitarists being able to play (barre) chords
as well as single notes.
The current and previous fret positions of the fretting
hand are then sent wirelessly to the Mothership using ESP-
NOW. On the Mothership, guitarists can set the fret thresh-
old from frets 1-9 via a rotary knob. This threshold deter-
mines the fret where one effect loop is engaged while the
other is disengaged. The Mothership receives the incom-
ing position data sent by the Scout and its ESP32 decides
which loop to engage according to the fret threshold set by
the guitar player. Actual switching is done by the digital
potentiometer in the mixer circuit.
The fret-hand setup is conceived to work alongside all off-
the-shelf guitar effects pedals and guitarists have the possi-

bility to individually customize their signal chain according
to their needs.
3.2 Pick-hand setup
The pick-hand setup allows guitarists to control effects ped-
als that possess an expression pedal input by the movements
or posture of the strumming/picking hand. The setup is
made up of two components, the Expressor as shown in
Fig. 1(b) and the Expressionist (depicted in small).
The Expressor is the device attached to the hand and
arm of the guitarist, capable of capturing the playing and
strumming movements of the player’s hand. It consists of an
IMU (inertial measurement unit) sensor (Blue Dot BNO055
breakout board), an ESP32, and custom-made textile straps
to fix the mentioned parts to the guitarist’s body.
The Expressionist sits on the ground on a pedalboard,
similar to the Mothership. It receives and processes the
data sent by the Expressor and uses it to control any guitar
effects pedal that has an expression pedal input. It com-
prises another ESP32, the digital potentiometer MCP4251,
an indicator LED, and an expression output (to be con-
nected to an effects pedal’s expression input through a TRS
cable). The components are housed in a stomp box similar
to standard effects pedals.
The pick-hand setup is intended to work like a common
expression pedal, with the difference that instead of being
controlled via foot, it can be set via the motion data of the
picking/strumming hand. The IMU sensor on the Expres-
sor measures the hand’s orientation and linear acceleration
data. These data streams are then sent wirelessly via ESP-
NOW to the Expressionist which processes and maps the
data. Via a rotary knob, guitarists can select which data
(orientation or acceleration) should be used to control the
effects pedal. The digital potentiometer alters the control
voltage that is supplied by the effects pedal, as an analog
expression pedal would do. The circuit also features a LED
whose brightness visualizes the expression pedal status and
gives players visual feedback.
Using the roll angle of the absolute hand orientation for
sweeping through an effect parameter works well, for ex-
ample, with filter-type effects such as a Wah-Wah. Using
linear acceleration data, smoothed by a moving average fil-
ter, works well for controlling effect strength, e.g., of a delay
effect.
4. CONCLUSION
The objective of this project was to design a control system
that allows to further leverage the sound-producing hand
gestures of guitarists to enable a smoother and more inti-
mate control of effects while at the same time being capable
to control off-the-shelf effects pedals to better integrate into
guitarists’ existing live setups.
The Dextoria system introduces guitarists to a novel, in-
novative approach to effects control while, at the same time,
enabling them to keep using their favorite effects pedals.
