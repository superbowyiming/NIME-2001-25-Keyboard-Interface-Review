ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present our research on the acquisition
of gesture information for the study of the expressiveness
in guitar performances. For that purpose, we design a sen-
sor system which is able to gather the movements from left
hand ﬁngers. Our eﬀort is focused on a design that is (1)
non-intrusive to the performer and (2) able to detect from
strong movements of the left hand to subtle movements of
the ﬁngers. The proposed system is based on capacitive sen-
sors mounted on the ﬁngerboard of the guitar. We present
the setup of the sensor system and analyze its response to
several ﬁnger movements.

1. INTRODUCTION
The guitar is one of the most popular instruments in west-
ern culture. Its study is a very active topic in diﬀerent
disciplines like acoustics, organology, or signal processing
[5, 12]. These studies provide valuable physical and gesture
information from vibratos, slurs, plucking style or dynamic
variations [4]. Nevertheless, the essence of guitar music is
sometimes reﬂected by subtile particularities which are com-
pletely dependent on the players, styles, or musical genres.
In other words, the richness of the guitar expressivity raises
a challenge that, even analyzing each string individually
(for instance using hexaphonic pickups), it is still partially
tackled. A possible approach to overcome these issues is to
enhance the (sound) information captured from the guitar
by acquiring gesture information.
The study of performer gestures in music is not new. For
instance, Young [14] presented a system to capture the per-
formance parameters in violin playing. Focusing on the gui-
tar, there are some interesting approaches studying the ges-
tures of guitar players [8, 13]. Gestural information related
to guitarists may refer from movements of the guitar body,
to the detailed study of speciﬁc ﬁnger movements. In our
case, we are interested in the study of the ﬁnger gestures
of the left hand. Such information may be useful for stud-
ies ranging from the analysis of speciﬁc performers to the
identiﬁcation of nuances in guitar solos.

Centering on the ﬁnger movements, the available approa-
ches are traditionally based on the analysis of images: Burns
[2, 3] proposed a method to visually detect and recognize
ﬁngering gestures of the left hand of a guitarist. Heijink
[6] proposed the use of a three-dimensional motion track-
ing system (Optotrak 3020) to analyze the behavior of the
left hand in a classical guitar. Norton [10] proposed the
use of another optical motion caption system based on the
Phase Space Inc., with quite successful results. Although
these systems provide valuable data, we advocate that it is
better to acquire gesture data as close as possible to the
ﬁngers instead of using indirect techniques, even with the
good results they provide. In fact, the information from
both (optical and capacitive) sensor systems can be com-
plementary.
The goal of this paper is to propose a sensing system that
allows the study of the gestures of the left hand ﬁngers in
guitar performances. This system has to be able to capture
frommacro-scale changes (i.e. the presence of ﬁnger bars)
to micro-scale changes (i.e. vibrato) in player’s movements.
Furthermore, the sensors have to be non-intrusive to the
player. The paper is organized as follows: First, in Section
2 argue and explain the approach we are using. Then, Sec-
tion 3 presents the setup of the system and summarizes a
set of static measurements such as background noise, sam-
pling frequency, and crosstalk. Next, in Section 4, we detail
all the experiments we made to analyze the sensor’s behav-
ior frommacro-scale to micro-scale. Finally, we summarize
the experimental results achieved by the sensor system in
Section 5.
2. CAPACITIVE SENSORS
As mentioned previously, most of the existing proposals for
left hand gesture caption are based on optical or image tech-
niques. Although these systems have proved to provide suc-
cessful results, under our point of view, either they are ex-
pensive or a bit intrusive to the performer, in terms of a
reduced mobility in live environments. On the other hand,
after observing several guitar players, we realized that the
ﬁngers do not perform a big pressure on the ﬁngerboard,
and even, do not necessarily touch the ﬁngerboard (spe-
cially in high pitches). Then, what we need is a distance
sensor that measures the distance between the fretboard
and the ﬁngers, and capacitive sensors perfectly accomplish
all these requirements.
Capacitive sensors are not new in music. The Theremin,
invented in 1919 by Lev Termen, is considered the ﬁrst elec-
tronic instrument in the history. It is based on the capaci-
tive eﬀect of a player near two antennas, one controlling the
pitch and the other controlling the loudness. More recently,
new musical interfaces and augmented instruments use also
capacitive sensors to control musical parameters [11, 7].

Technically speaking, capacitive sensing is based on the
change of capacitance of two conductive electrodes in a di-
electric. The capacitance is the ratio of electric charge over
a voltage:
C = q
V (1)
where C is the capacitance in Farads [F], q is the charge in
Coulombs [Q], and V is voltage in Volts [ V].
The capacitance of an ideal capacitor built up with two
conductive parallel plates is computed as:
C = ε0εr
S
d (2)
where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8 .85 ×10−12[F/m]),
εr is the relative permittivity of the medium (1.0005 for the
air, adimensional), dis the distance between the two plates
in [m], and S is the plate area in [ m2].
When using capacitors as sensors, their capacity inversely
changes on the distance between the electrodes. But in our
conﬁguration, we use the load modedeﬁned by Miranda [9]
in which the distance between the electrode and a single ob-
ject (the performer’s ﬁnger in our case) is measured through
a change in capacitance of the electrode to ground. There
are diﬀerent options to build capacitive sensors and their
control unit. Home made sensors are useful for very spe-
ciﬁc applications, but their use is not recommended because
of the electrical problems may appear (background noise,
stability, robustness to interferences, etc.). CapToolKit 1 is
a hardware and software toolkit for prototyping capacitive
sensing systems. It consists of a control unit and a set of
capacitive sensors, and the software implementing the pro-
tocol to communicate with your computer. Capsense 2 is a
capacitive sensing library for Arduino. Arduino is a widely
used open-source electronics prototyping platform that ap-
propriate to our requirements. Speciﬁcally, Capsense is a
library that converts the Arduino digital pins into capaci-
tive sensors that are used to sense the electrical capacitance
of the human body. Moreover, in our work we use this last
option because it allows to combine the acquisition using
capacitive sensors with other analog sensors (not included
in this paper) using the same platform.
3. SETUP
The aim of our sensing system is to acquire gestural infor-
mation from the left hand movements. For that purpose, an
array of capacitive sensors was mounted on the fretboard
of the guitar. These sensors provide information relative to
the presence of ﬁngers into that speciﬁc fret. Speciﬁcally,
depending on the number of ﬁngers present in a given fret,
the position of these ﬁngers, and the pressure of the ﬁngers
to the strings, the response of the sensors diﬀer.
The two electrodes of the capacitor consist on an alu-
minum foil and the player’s ﬁnger. In fact, the player’s
ﬁnger is not an electrode, but it is able to modify the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld generated by the aluminum foil. The di-
electric is achieved by using adhesive tape. Aluminum foils
provide a capacitive value proportional to the distance be-
tween the player’s ﬁnger and the foil itself, depending on
the active surface (notice that, in real guitar playing, the
ﬁngers do not necessarily touch the ﬁngerboard, specially
in high pitches). Since the response of the sensors is also
inﬂuenced by the area, diﬀerent ﬁnger positions can be de-
tected. The main advantage of using this technique is that

it is not intrusive neither to the player nor to the recorded
sound (See Figure 1 for details).
As mentioned above, we use the Capsense library for Ar-
duino. The diagram of the whole gesture acquisition envi-
ronment is shown in Figure 2.
3.1 Noise, stability, and sampling rate
According to the literature, capacitive sensors with small
capacitive electrodes can be noisy and unstable[1]. Capacitive-
based sensor systems explained in Section 2 propose some
solutions to provide stability and noise reduction at the
same time they provide an acceptable sampling rate. These
solutions can be referred to hardware (modiﬁcation of the
resistor’s value) or software (adaptive low pass ﬁltering,
sampling rate, etc.). In our case, we experimentally set
the resistor’s value to R= 4.7MΩ (R1 to R10 in Figure 2),
the maximum sampling rate to τmax = 100[ms] and a low
pass ﬁltering with a ﬁxed length of L= 5 samples.
In the conﬁguration we chose (i.e. using the Arduino), the
sampling rate depends on the measured value. Moreover,
the sampling rate also depends on the number of used sen-
sors. In consequence, the sampling rate is not constant. We
converted measured data to MIDI, using PitchBend mes-
sages to provide enough resolution. MIDI data is automat-
ically synchronized with the audio using a sequencer.
Beyond that, it is important to keep the control unit close
to the sensors to avoid an important increase in the back-
ground noise and a high decrease of stability and sampling
rate. Our ﬁrst prototype was mounted near the computer
with long cables to the sensors (about 5 meters). This setup
provided a mean background noise for all the frets about
35 relative capacitance units [rcu], and a sampling rate
about 15[Hz]. In our second prototype, the control unit
was mounted on the guitar, as shown in Figure 1, obtaining
a mean background noise for all the frets about 2[rcu] and
a sampling rate about 35[ Hz]. These measurements have
been made under the same hardware and software condi-
tions and averaged on diﬀerent setups using 10,5,3 and 1
capacitive sensors, to avoid the dependence on the number
of used sensors.
Finally, by maintaining the control unit near the sensors,

we avoid unexpected jumps in the background noise values
in a long performance recording, that is, we increased the
stability of the system.
3.2 Crosstalk
As explained in Section 3, capacitive sensors capture the
distance between the aluminum foil and the ﬁngers. In real
guitar performances, the ﬁngers and the rest of the hand are
quite close one each other and may aﬀect to many sensors.
In addition to that, capacitive sensor platforms with mul-
tiple sensors generate some degree of dependency between
data received from diﬀerent sensors.
We measured and quantiﬁed this crosstalk from each fret
with respect to the previous and the forthcoming ones, in
three diﬀerent scenarios: (1) playing bars from frets 2 to
9, in which the whole ﬁnger is acting to the whole sensor,
(2) playing on the 6th string from frets 2 to 9, in which
the whole ﬁnger is over the sensor but only the tip is really
acting, and (3) playing on the 1st string from frets 2 to 9,
in which only the ﬁngertip is over and acting to the sensor.
Results of this measurement (see Table 1) show a crosstalk
about a 30% to 50% of the target value, which is not negli-
gible. Nevertheless, the diﬀerence is always signiﬁcant (e.g.
for the measurements of ﬁnger bars we obtain a diﬀerence of,
at least, 200[rcu] whereas pressing single strings the diﬀer-
ence achieves 80[rcu]). In summary, crosstalk is not crucial
but needs to be taken into account when analyzing forth-
coming results.
4. EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we analyze the data acquired by capacitive
sensors when diﬀerent gestural movements are performed.
We start studying gestures at macro-scale. Next, we pro-
ceed with the study at micro-scale gesture level by analyzing
the response of the sensors to diﬀerent musical articulations.
The ﬁrst experiment studies the response of the sensors
when the hand moves through the ﬁngerboard, from the
nut to the body of the guitar, whereas a ﬁnger is pressing
all the strings in a given fret (ﬁnger bars). Next, we ana-
lyze the response of the sensors when performing chromatic
scales over the same string, i.e. the ﬁnger moves through
the ﬁngerboard but the hand is more free than the previous
case. Third, we study a speciﬁc case of chromatic move-
ment: the grace notes. Grace notes are, in terms of gesture,
small excerpts of a chromatic scale played too fast.
After analyzing the response of the system when acting
over the same string, the following experiments are con-
ducted to study the response of the sensors when the posi-
tion of the left hand is ﬁxed and the ﬁngers are pressing dif-
ferent strings at diﬀerent frets. Speciﬁcally, ﬁrst recordings
are performed by playing a diatonic scale. Next, follow-
ing with the multiple strings analysis, we present the study
of basic arpeggios in order to detect whether the caption
system is able to deal with diﬀerent (near to static) hand
positions. In this experiment, we combine gestures observed
in the analysis of fret bars and diatonic scales.
Additionally, we study a speciﬁc case of a gesture where
the left hand plays the main role: hammer-on and hammer-
oﬀ. In this gesture, a ﬁnger is pressing a string in a given
fret whereas another ﬁnger presses and depresses the same
string in an upper fret.
Finally, we analyze vibrato. Vibratos are achieved by fast
and short horizontal movements of a ﬁnger that produce
frequency oscillations. Notice that, in vibratos, the ﬁngers
do not change neither the fret nor the string. Thus, the
purpose of this experiment is to analyze how this ﬁnger
oscillations are captured by the sensors.
4.1 Finger Bars
As mentioned in Section 3.2, ﬁnger bars present the maxi-
mum contact area between the ﬁnger and the sensor. Then,
the detection of the presence of a bar should be an easy task.
For this recording, all strings are pressed by a ﬁnger, start-
ing at the ﬁrst fret; then, ascending fret by fret until the

10th fret; next a pause of a beat; and ﬁnally, going down
to the ﬁrst fret. The change of fret occurs every 4 beats at
60[bpm].
Results (see Figure 3) show values ranging from 450 to
600[rcu] at the identiﬁed frets, and lower values in their
neighbors, as explained in Section 3.2. As a conclusion of
this experiment, we state that it is relatively easy to detect
the presence of a bar using capacitive sensors.
4.2 Chromatic scales
Next, we record a set of chromatic scales, one for each
string, starting with the open string and playing an ascend-
ing scale until the 10th. fret. The change of fret occurs ev-
ery 4 beats at 60[bpm]. Results (see Figure 4) show values
about 200[rcu], about 50% less than the previous experi-
ment. This result was expected because, in the chromatic
scales, although the active surface between the ﬁnger and
the sensor can be the same (e.g. the case when playing
6th string), the ﬁnger is more distant to the fret and the
measured capacitance is lower.
Nevertheless, the measured values are still big enough to
detect which fret is pressed in all the recordings with respect
to the background noise and the crosstalk values from the
neighbors. Furthermore, there are no signiﬁcative diﬀer-
ences between de recorded data provided by the sensors for
the diﬀerent strings. As a conclusion of this experiment,
we state that it is relatively easy to detect the fret which is
pressed while playing a monophonic melody.
4.3 Grace notes
As shown in the previous section, there are no relevant
diﬀerences in the behavior of the acquired data from ca-
pacitive sensors for diﬀerent strings. Then, for simplicity,
experiments with grace notes are restricted to the ﬁrst 3
stings. We conducted two diﬀerent experiments: ascending
and descending grace notes. Ascending grace notes start at
the second fret, playing with an ascending grace note from
the previous fret until the 10th fret. In an analogous way,
recordings of descending grace notes start at the 9th fret
and continued to the 1st one. The change of fret occurs
every 4 beats at 60[ bpm].
Analyzing all the gathered data, grace notes are detected
independently on the fret and the string where they oc-
cur. Speciﬁcally, grace notes follow the same pattern: a
capacitance peak at the initial fret and a contiguous acti-
vation of the target fret, at the same time that the initial
one decreases to the background level (but, as mentioned
in Section 3.2, some crosstalk eﬀect is appreciated). More-
over, results are equivalent for ascending and descending
grace notes.
For instance, Figure 5 shows an example of the change in
relative capacitance from the initial note (4th fret, with a
short duration) and the target note (5th fret, one semitone

over, with a longer duration). Although in this example
grace note detection seem an aﬀordable task, it is important
to take into account that the sampling rate of the system
is relatively low (about 35[Hz ]). Then, if grace notes are
played too fast, the system can loose them.
4.4 Diatonic scale
In opposition to the study of chromatic scales, shown in
Section 4.2, we performed the study of major diatonic scales
played at ﬁrst position. In this scenario, the left hand and
the ﬁngers are static over the same consecutive frets and,
depending on the note, one of the ﬁngers presses one of
the 6 strings at the assigned fret. There are no two ﬁngers
pressing at the same time. This experiment is closer to the
movements of ﬁngers in musical pieces.
The reported example corresponds to 2 octaves of a de-
scending A major scale played at ﬁrst position (see score
and ﬁngerings at Figure 6). The played frets follow the se-
quence: 5-4-7-5-7-6-4-7-6-4-7-5-4-7-5. The change of note
occurs every beat at 60[bpm].
Results shown in Figure 7 show how the fret with maxi-
mum measured relative capacitance always corresponds to
the target fret, i.e. we are able to detect the pressed fret.
Moreover, close ﬁnger positions produce crosstalk interfer-

For instance, at t = 22[s], the 7th fret rises up to 150[ rcu]
at the same time that the 6th fret also increases its value
about 25[rcu].
4.5 Basic Arpeggios
Let us study now whether the system is able to deal with
diﬀerent (near static) hand positions. We study the abil-
ity of capacitive sensors to discriminate between two hand
positions playing the same arpeggio. The reported excerpt
shown in Figure 8 was played at the ﬁrst position (strings
3-2-1-1) and with a bar at the ﬁfth fret (strings 4-3-2-2).
The change of note occurs every beat at 60[ bpm].
Results (see Figure 9) show, for the ﬁrst position, ﬁnger
pressure at frets 1 and 3 for the 2nd and 4th played notes,
respectively. In the second one, the bar is detected at fret
5, while the ﬁnger at fret 8 is only detected for the last note
(see the pitch information also included in the graph).
The measured relative capacitance diﬀers depending on
the used articulation. Bars provide highest values of rela-
tive capacitance and, as a residual eﬀect, the relative capac-
itance from the neighbor frets is also aﬀected. Nevertheless,
the noise introduced by the bar does not prevent us to de-
tect the ﬁnger pressure at fret 8, which is clearly above the
residual noise when playing the 4th note.
In contrast, at the upper graph, the residual noise of the
measured relative capacitance is near to zero while playing
1st and 3rd note. When pressing with the ﬁnger at the 1st
and 3rd frets for the 2nd and 4th notes respectively, the
residual noise is increased but, again, it does not prevent us
to detect the fret which is pressed. Notice that, whatever
the presence of a bar or the level of the background noise,
the relative measured capacitance when pressing 1st or 2nd
string for diﬀerent frets is similar. This feature is important

for the recognition task.
4.6 Hammer on/off
The aim of this experiment is to study the behavior of the
capacitive sensor system with multiple ﬁngers acting simul-
taneously. For that, we study the behavior of the capaci-
tive sensor system while playing hammer-on and hammer-
oﬀ articulations. Speciﬁcally, we played a chromatic scale
at 60[bpm], changing to the next semitone every 4 beats.
We apply the hammer-on articulation at the beginning of
the 2nd beat and the hammer-oﬀ at the beginning of the
3rd beat.
Hammer-on/oﬀ gestures are clearly captured by the ca-
pacitive sensor system. The presented pattern is a contin-
uous activation of the fret where the ﬁxed ﬁnger is located
whereas a higher activation arises when the second ﬁnger
acts. A crosstalk eﬀect appears when both ﬁngers are press-
ing the string, but it does not prevent a good gesture recog-
nition.
For instance, Figure 10 shows an example of recorded
gestures corresponding to the 8th fret and applying the
hammer-on and hammer-oﬀ at the 9th fret, on the 3rd
string. The 8th fret is clearly detected for the 1st, 3rd
and 4th beats, while the 9th fret rises at the 2nd beat. We
can also observe the eﬀect of the crosstalk eﬀect described
in Section 3.2. The sensor system proposed in this paper is
also able to detect hammer on articulations.
4.7 Vibrato
As in the previous cases, the study of vibrato was limited to
the ﬁrst 3 strings. Vibrato recordings are similar to those
described for the chromatic scales in Section 4.2, starting at
the ﬁrst fret and playing an ascending scale until the 10th

occurs every 4 beats at 60[bpm].
Sensors are able to detect the two notes in a bar but
the measured capacitance follows a diﬀerent pattern: in
the ﬁrst note (without vibrato) the measured capacitance
is constant whereas in the second note (when vibrato is
applyed) an oscillation of the capacitance is detected. For
instance, Figure 11 shows an oscillation for the last two
beats, then, the presence of vibrato is detected.
Unfortunately, vibrato depth and vibrato rate are diﬃcult
to detect because of the sampling rate of the sensing sys-
tem. Although 35[Hz] should be enough to compute these
parameters, it is only two or three times over the Nyquist
frequency for a vibrato rate of 5 or 6[Hz]. Higher sampling
rate would be appreciated.
5. CONCLUSIONS
From the results achieved in the experiments described in
the previous sections, we may conclude that capacitive sen-
sors mounted on the fretboard of a guitar are useful to the
acquisition of left hand gestures. We have analyzed their ca-
pabilities in diﬀerent situations, from macro to micro scale
of gestures, and we have reported the limitations of the cur-
rent prototype. Summarizing, the main advantages of using
this technology are: (1) non intrusiveness, (2) low cost, (3)
high dynamic range, (4) low background noise, and (5) high
ﬁdelity to the ﬁnger and hand movements. The cons are:
(1) crosstalk, (2) slightly low sampling rate, and (3) no dis-
crimination between strings.
As mentioned in Section 1, the study here presented fo-
cuses on the basic gestures used when playing guitar melodies.
This is part of a more ambitious project in which we want
to explain particular articulations used by diﬀerent play-
ers, styles or musical genres. To achieve tis goal, we plan
to conduct experiments with multiple guitar performers to
study (1) the robustness of the prototype, (2) the gesture
diﬀerences among guitarists, and (3) the gesture diﬀerences
among musical styles. We are also working on hardware
modiﬁcations to ﬁx problems with sampling rate, increas-
ing it and making it constant. Moreover, we plan to an-
alyze the use of this sensor system on polyphonic audio,
that is, playing chords, multiple voices, or melodies with
harmonic/rhythmic accompaniment.
Finally, although is not the main focus of our research,
we are interested in exploring the possibilities of the system
as a music controller, i.e. to be used for artistic purposes.
