ABSTRACT
This paper addresses environmental issues around NIME research and practice. We 
discuss the formulation of an environmental statement for the conference as well as 
the initiation of a NIME Eco Wiki containing information on environmental concerns 
related to the creation of new musical instruments. We outline a number of these 
concerns and, by systematically reviewing the proceedings of all previous NIME 
conferences, identify a general lack of reflection on the environmental impact of the 
research undertaken. Finally, we propose a framework for addressing the making, 
testing, using, and disposal of NIMEs in the hope that sustainability may become a 
central concern to researchers.

Introduction
Environmental issues have been discussed for decades, yet the topic has received 
remarkably little attention in the NIME community. The authors first met as part of an 
initiative to develop an environmental statement for the NIME conference. The 
statement, published on the nime.org website, serves as a policy document both within 
and outside of the community. The work on the environmental statement sparked an 
interest in investigating the topic further. In this paper, we report on the current state 
of affairs concerning sustainable NIME practice, from individual to the community. The 
first aim was to review the NIME literature for papers related to environmental issues 
or practices. Next, we focused on developing the NIME Eco Wiki, including 
suggestions and tools to help NIME researchers and practitioners develop more 
environmentally-friendly practices. Finally, we propose a model for the systematic 
inclusion of environmental action in NIME research practice.

NIME Environmental Statement
To promote awareness of environmental issues in the community, the NIME 
Conference Environmental Statement is a policy document outlining the bigger picture 
and making a call for action. It was developed during the fall of 2020 through a series 
of online workshops and collaborative writing. The statement was endorsed by the 
NIME Steering Committee in November 2020 and was ultimately launched on 
nime.org. The short version of the statement reads:
Every action we perform, including research, has an impact on our ecosystem. 
NIME is committed to environmental sustainability and conservation in both the 
delivery of the annual conference and in our day to day research and artistic 
practices. The complete NIME Conference Environmental Statement can be found 
at: www.nime.org/environment.
The statement is thought of as a living document, owned by the community. It is 
released with a CC-BY license, to promote sharing of the content, for example, to other 
conferences and communities.
(Self) reflection in the NIME community
In recent years, a tradition of auto-analysis has emerged in the NIME conference. For 
instance, Marquez-Borbon and Stapleton reflected on the NIME community’s values, 
addressing the positive effect of structuring knowledge in documented activities to 
help guide beginners’ practice and learning process. They also reflected on how the 
lack of community understanding of performance inhibits constructive critique 
development [1]. Discussing the meaning of the community, Cantrell proposed five 
broad cultural categories for looking at histories, as well as creative and technical 
discourses surrounding the design of new musical instruments [2]. Other reflections on 
the community focused on what craft means within the NIME community [3].
Surveys proved to be of use, for instance, to investigate "control, instrumental entropy, 
limitations, and creativity" in NIMEs [4], to study the use of thematic analysis 
approach as input to the design of new DMIs [5], and to look at the identity on NIMEs 
concerning the aesthetic of the music and the repertoire [6].
Systematic analysis of NIME proceedings has been conducted to study the meaning of 
the word gesture for NIME authors [7], evaluation strategies used (or not used) [8], 
and to look for trends in the development of NIMEs [9]. In [10], authors analyzed 
proceedings from the NIME, ICMC, and SMC conferences to explore how issues

4
related to digital musical instrument (DMI) stability, reliability, and compatibility have 
been addressed in prior research.
Ecologies and ethics
The term ecology has mainly been used in the discourse on DMIs to indicate the entire 
complex set of agents, including performers, composers, other instruments, 
environment, etc. For instance, Gurevich and Trevino proposed that the ecology of 
music creation should focus on the "relationships between composers, performers, and 
listeners as a part of a system" that also considers history, genre, and context [11]. 
Similarly, Waters speaks about performance ecosystems to study the interaction 
between performers, instruments, and environments [12]. Recently, this perspective 
was further developed by borrowing the concept of artefact ecology [13],[14],[15] or 
reflecting on the quality of musical instruments [16]. However, the idea of ecology in 
an environmental sense is still under-explored.
Only recently, a few authors have started to reflect on the political implications of 
NIME research, and in one case, directly pointing out environmental issues. Hayes and 
Marquez-Borbon mainly focused on diversity, inclusion, and accessibility while also 
addressing the market demands of the neoliberal university [17]. Morreale et al. open 
up the perspective by arguing for the need for an outward-looking effort that accounts 
for social, ethical, and cultural issues related to new digital musical instruments 
created within and outside the NIME discourse [18]. In their paper, Morreale et al. 
also touch on environmental issues:
“environmental costs are not limited to the production and disposal phase, and 
our analysis should also include environmental costs at run time" [18].
Intersection of NIME practice/music technology and 
environmental issues
Physical impact
As with all other technologies, musical instrument making was initially dependent on 
local resources such as when Stradivari sourced materials from the woods of 
Paneveggio. However, with the rise of imperialism and increased international trade in 
the 17th and 18th century, ivory became common for piano keys from around 1700 [19]
 — a practice that was only banned in 1989 under the CITES (Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) treaty [20]. 
Brazilian Rosewood, used extensively in guitar making up until the 1960s, is similarly 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression NIME and the Environment: Toward a More Sustainable NIME Practice
5
banned under CITES [21]. While NIMEs rarely, if ever, make use of exotic woods, let 
alone elephant tusk, their heavy reliance on electrical and digital technologies 
suggests that other factors may be at play in an evaluation of the sustainability of its 
designs. Devine [22] brought attention to the difficulty of identifying the raw material 
supply chain for the PVC and resin used in vinyl record production. Likely, the supply 
chain for the basic electronic components of a DMI is just as opaque, possibly a reason 
why this is rarely addressed in the literature. An exception is Collins where the author 
expresses “The desire to shrink my silicon footprint”[23]. While Collins’ concern here 
is with the environmental impact of electronic recycling in China, a byproduct of 
silicon extraction is carbon monoxide, putting the miners involved with its extraction at 
risk of developing silicosis [24].
On the industry level, companies such as Fairphone address these issues by releasing 
products with interchangeable parts that can be repaired and safely recycled, while 
using minerals that are as much as possible sustainably mined. These are bold claims 
and the validity of which will be beyond this paper’s scope to investigate. Individual 
NIMEs are usually produced in low numbers (see [6]) and as such do not directly 
engage with mass production in their output phase. It is, however, a concern that the 
input phase of the designs relies on mass-produced electronics, the production and 
disposal of which have global environmental consequences. Additionally, with a core 
principle of the community being research and experimentation, the sometimes 
multiple iterations leading to a working NIME are in danger of creating a trail of 
electronic scrap, some of which will be unusable for new designs. As such, the 
environmental impact of a NIME may not be evident from the mere observation of its 
most recent iteration.
Significantly, the sharp fall in 3D-printing costs has made certain kinds of prototyping 
much more straightforward, leading to the risk of proliferation of intermediate 
iterations and hence, an increase in PLA waste. PLA, being a bioplastic, requires an 
industrial composter for its recycling [25] and as such, requires a rigorous 
infrastructure for its secure disposal. Additionally, PLA is made from (often genetically 
modified) corn and therefore presents the same problems as biofuels: monoculture 
farming that impoverishes topsoil and requires fertiliser and pesticides while 
occupying land where food could be grown, ultimately threatening biodiversity [26].
Data impact
As with virtually all other areas of life, machine learning has become ubiquitous in 
music technology, for example, in Izotope’s RX and Neutron software [27]. While 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression NIME and the Environment: Toward a More Sustainable NIME Practice
6
machine learning is often used in NIMEs, such as the Wekinator [28], their algorithms 
are built to train and run on laptop computers (and in the case of Wekinator, in real-
time). As such, they are nowhere near as energy-hungry as large-scale training 
networks such as Natural Language Processing algorithms [29]. However, the fact 
remains that CPU-intensive, and hence, power-hungry processes not exclusive to 
machine learning have become part of NIME’s identity [30]. With the introduction of 
microprocessors such as Raspberry PI and the Bela, some energy efficiency has been 
gained, with these processors requiring less power than a laptop and audio interface. 
However, it is an open question to which extent this gain is enough to offset the 
environmental impact of the manufacturing and eventual disposal of the 
microprocessors.
Use and reuse of NIMEs
A recurring theme brought up in NIME papers is the longevity of DMIs and NIMEs [31]
[32][33]. A DMI that ends up on a shelf with no life beyond the initial presentation 
freezes up resources from a sustainability perspective. We recognise that the 
individual DMI may form the basis of subsequent DMIs or in other ways inform 
research or create musical value in the world of instrument design. Still, we agree with 
Morreale et al. that it is necessary to critically address the high turnout of prototype 
NIMEs as a cause for environmental concern. Academic and artistic communities are 
not immune to the capitalist mantra of growth and continuous output. With NIME’s 
research output being directly tied to production chains relying on fossil fuels and 
mining, it becomes apparent that Reduce, Reuse, Recycle may be a more fitting 
mantra.
Systematic review of NIME literature
To assess the degree to which environmental issues have been raised within NIME, we 
conducted a review of the NIME conference proceedings. The full proceedings are 
freely available from the NIME website and are comprised of 1867 papers spanning 
each year of the conference from 2001 to 2020. The review entailed an automated 
search for a selection of relevant keywords followed by manual inspection of the most 
relevant papers.
The keyword search of the proceedings utilises the OS X terminal command mdfind to 
return files matching a given query. This technique was used previously in systematic 
reviews by [7] and [10]. A shell script was written to automate the search and save 
results in a readable .csv format.1 The script is placed in the root of a directory 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression NIME and the Environment: Toward a More Sustainable NIME Practice
7
alongside sub-directories of NIME proceedings by year. It is run from the command 
line with any number of keywords to be searched for listed as arguments. The results 
provide the number and filenames of papers containing each keyword for each year.
Several keywords were generated that we felt would likely be mentioned in papers 
related to environmental topics. After review and discussion, nine terms were selected 
and run in the search.
Results
The following table shows each keyword and the number of papers that the term 
occurred in.
Unsurprisingly, several of the chosen keywords are used throughout the NIME 
proceedings in contexts that are unrelated to environmental sustainability. Most 
notably, environment appears in more than half of all papers. To narrow the results to 
a smaller subset of papers for manual inspection, only papers in which 2 or more 
keywords appeared were selected, yielding 124 results.

While this selection method isn't infallible, we found it effective as a filter to reduce 
the large proceedings to a manageable subset for closer inspection. Here, we found 7 
papers that directly engage with environmental concerns, 6 of which present a new 
NIME, while a further 5 papers mention these concerns in passing, without identifying 
them as central to the research.
From these 12 papers, we have identified three main concerns:
In the following, we locate the place of each paper within these categories:
Raising awareness of ecological and environmental issues
Sonification of data tied to climate change and pollution is found in 6 papers, of which 
four ([34][35][36][37]) specifically mention environmental concerns.
Suchánek [34] describes the sonification of organic material (soil) in reference to 
drought caused by climate change. According to the author, the installation serves to 
"communicate an actual environmental topic in a quite unexpected way".
A recent paper by Magnusson et al. [35] mentions Eldridge’s current reflection about 
the role of interactive music in “perceptualizing” audio data sets to support 
understanding and interpretation of environmental data. In particular, the ecoacoustic

used in an ecological-related context), investigates strategies to 
monitoring biodiversity from Ecuadorian Amazon and cloud forests, Indonesian reefs, 
and the Swedish Arctic.
In a paper by Lynch and Paradiso [36], the term environment is used in many ways, 
including a reflection on acoustic ecology environments, in connection with literature 
discussing sounds of trees, and sound in relation to physical/ecological environment. 
The system presented in the paper can sonify various data, including climate change, 
daily cycles and weather patterns.
In a paper by Smallwood about sound art [37], environmental interaction through 
photovoltaic panels is explicitly linked to energy factors, and therefore to 
environmental awareness. “Various ecological threads of sustainability, including 
music’s own acoustic ecology phenomenon” are mentioned as a background motivation 
of the work.
In Gaye et al. [38][39], pollution sensors are mentioned together with a number of 
other sensors. However, the authors do not mention environmental concerns.
In discussing an instrument made of discarded wood (driftwood), Rieger and Topel 
note that our “actions intervene directly with issues relating to sustainability and the 
amount of value we place on the world in which we live” [40].
Addressing environmental impact of music technology design
In a paper about Sustainable Instrument Redesign [41], Freed suggests that “the 
Fingerphone can serve as a strong signal that more environmentally responsible 
materials and design techniques are available”. The carbon footprint of a previously 
commercially available instrument is mentioned, and the new design is focused on 
having a low carbon footprint. 
Koelhy et al., in a paper on home-made touch sensors, conclude that “these interfaces 
can even be granted an environmental-friendly label as one can use only recycled 
materials to produce them” [42].
Fraietta briefly mentions the environmental impact of OSC as compared to MIDI [43].

Discussing ecological and environmental concerns within the context of 
political and cultural issues
Papers by Morreale et al. [17] and Lepri and McPherson [44] both address or mention 
sustainability in the context of moral, political and social values. While the data set is 
too small to draw any definitive conclusions, it may still be worth noticing that we have 
only found such prescriptive and value-based discussions in recent papers.
NIME Eco Wiki
The results of our summary review of the NIME proceedings are striking, if 
unsurprising. Out of nearly 2000 papers over 20 years of conferences, only twelve 
papers were identified that explicitly mentioned environmental issues. To support the 
NIME environmental statement, and encourage the community to fully engage with 
these important issues, we have initiated the NIME Eco Wiki which is introduced here.
In Interaction Design literature “the perspective that sustainability can and should be 
a central focus of interaction design” was introduced by Blevis [45], in the following 
discussion, environmental issues can be addressed from two perspectives (see for 
instance [46] [47]):
The NIME Eco Wiki belongs to the second set of tools; it is a repository that aims to 
provide NIME practitioners with a collection of articles proposing solutions to 
environmental issues related to music technology or interaction design research in 
general.
In the following paragraphs, after describing the overall structure of the wiki, we 
discuss the governance and the wiki's intrinsic value against related literature on wikis 
and commons platforms.
Overview
The Eco Wiki has so far focused on three main points that, through initial discussions, 
emerged as potentially critical in fostering an environmentally sustainable practice. 
1. sustainability in design, when the environmental issues are addressed as part of the 
material design of an artefact
2. sustainability through design, when an artefact addresses environmental issues 
indirectly, focusing on “ways of living and processes of social change” [47].
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression NIME and the Environment: Toward a More Sustainable NIME Practice
11
The first point aims to account for environmental issues in the overall work 
organisation, including workflow, communication, and online presence. The wiki pages 
that belong to this category are not specifically related to NIME but could be useful to 
support a more environmentally sustainable workflow generally. As office workflow can 
constitute a massive percentage of a NIME researcher’s activity, we decided to give 
this topic an important place in the wiki. Entries about communication tools, video 
conferencing, and web hosting services belong to this category.
The second point addresses the development of new NIMEs. This is probably the wiki's 
central goal and the element that is more exclusive to the NIME community. Entries 
that fall in this category, so far, include 3D printing and machine learning.
Finally, the third point aims at collecting related projects and initiatives. In the last 
years, many artistic and music initiatives, as well as HCI projects related to the need to 
battle the effects of climate change have emerged. This page aims to collect such 
projects that can be of inspiration for supporting an environmentally aware NIME 
practice.
Governance and dynamics in the Eco Wiki
Up to this point, five persons directly contributed to the wiki, and the three proposers 
of the wiki have edited the main corpus of entries. This mirrors a general trend in 
wikis, as Arazy and colleges pointed out: "few highly active members and many 
occasional editors that make a few contributions"[48]. In light of this, there is still 
quite some work to do in order to render this wiki a common belonging to the 
community. In the following section, we outline some reflections about the work done 
so far.
Information quality
In their paper about information quality and work organisation in Wikipedia [49], 
Stvilia et al. outlined strategies that have been created to guarantee standards within 
Wikipedia. The authors outline how information quality tools and artefacts (e.g. 
templates, best practice guides) “are continually created to promote consistency in the 
content, structure, and presentation of articles” [49]. The authors also highlighted how 
the various entries are “carefully reviewed and discussed”.
Following the same strategy, we developed a template to provide each page with a 
similar structure and support the reader in navigating and browsing through the 
different entries. In this template, we included a section where we ask any author of an 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression NIME and the Environment: Toward a More Sustainable NIME Practice
12
entry to frame the topic with specific questions about environmental impact and 
possible solutions. We argue that this exercise can help reflect upon which 
perspectives are more relevant for that entry. Moreover, we created a list of possible 
entries to suggest additions to the wiki. We decided to softly curate the wiki to control 
the information quality and check the formatting. So far, the only edition performed on 
other authors' entries has been a reformatting of information to maintain coherence 
among the articles.
Arazy et al. analysed how Wikipedia group work is organised to assure information 
quality [48]. The authors, distinguished between two groups (administrative, and 
content creators) and different ways in which these groups impact the quality of the 
articles. We acknowledge that the Eco Wiki is too small to generate articulated 
interactions. However, the structure we have given to the wiki aims at supporting 
positive collaborations. For instance, having a list of possible needed entries can help 
diffuse the tasks, and providing the template can foster clarity in the content.
Resembling FLOSS and implicit values
O’Maho stated that “Wikipedia is arguably the first application of the open source 
community-managed model to a new context” [50]. Stvilia et al. highlighted how pages 
are “carefully reviewed and discussed in ways very similar to open source 
programming projects.” [49]. Therefore, we also want to use the lens of FLOSS-related 
literature to look at the Eco Wiki.
In their book about values, commons, and computing, Hakken et al. argued that the 
core value of FLOSS and Wikipedias, is an implicit approach to openness [51]. The 
authors proposed that such openness affords excellent flexibility in facilitating 
collective decisions; therefore, it can represent collective wishes. Consequently, such a 
model can oppose the economic perspective generally valued in a centralised and 
capitalistic approach to computing. On the contrary, it can support the democratisation 
of knowledge and governance. Following a similar perspective, Poderi proposed the 
idea of “platforms as commons” to describe those platforms “based on various 
arrangements for the shared ownership and management of both their infrastructures 
and services or products” [52].
Based on these reflections, we believe that the Eco Wiki won’t merely represent a tool 
to support a more environmentally aware NIME practice, but can also facilitate the 
emergence of shared values and reflection about this topic. Additionally, the wiki may 
support the first point proposed by Morreale et al. to develop an out-looking agenda 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression NIME and the Environment: Toward a More Sustainable NIME Practice
13
for NIME community [53]: to deepen current conversations and start new ones. We 
hope that this tool can facilitate a debate within NIME, and soon involve many direct 
or indirect contributors and readers representing, therefore, multiple perspectives and 
collective wishes.
Discussion
Current limitations of the NIME Eco Wiki
The main limitation of the wiki so far is that it is still in its infancy. Being five months 
old and the number of people involved relatively low, the number of entries and related 
content is still limited. The main priority, therefore, is to attract more contributors. 
This will be done by letting more people know about the resource, and also develop a 
culture of contribution.
Diversity
One disadvantage of the wiki is that the current contributors are all white males. In 
her reflection about the type of knowledge in Wikipedia, van der Velden points out how 
the design process is ongoing but no longer dynamic or transformative [54]. This 
transformed Wikipedia from “a project with the potential to decolonize knowledge” to 
a new form of “hegemonic order” [54]. We acknowledge that this is a risk that the 
NIME Eco Wiki can face, and are eager to address it while the project grows, hopefully 
in collaboration with NIME’s diversity and ethical officers.
Language
English is the lingua franca of international research communication, and the Eco Wiki 
also began as an English-language resource. This is a good way to reach the 
(currently) active NIME community, within which many non-native English speakers 
are also involved. Yet, we are aware of the limitations this put on the community’s 
ability to grow beyond its current state. This is not intentional, and we acknowledge 
that the language may be a barrier to many possible contributors, and be seen as a, de 
facto, neocolonialist behaviour. Recent initiatives, such as the Helsinki Initiative on 
Multilingualism in Scholarly Communication [55], promote language diversity in 
research. Some conferences, such as the Participatory Design Conference (PDC) 2020 
allowed authors to submit papers in the local languages (the conference was organized 
in South America, so Spanish and Portuguese were allowed). This attracted many local 
scholars, enriching the debate with a perspective that would otherwise be absent.
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression NIME and the Environment: Toward a More Sustainable NIME Practice
14
In our experience, many undergraduate study programmes are typically taught in local 
languages, while it is more common to use English in graduate programmes. Having 
access to information in a local language could positively impact many students and 
practitioners. Just in the same way that Wikipedia has multilingual support, we would 
like to also facilitate the possibility of multiple languages in the Eco Wiki. Technically 
this is feasible, but we are unsure whether there is currently enough traction to 
support the translation of content. Developing and maintaining new content in a 
multilingual wiki is also much more time-consuming. One solution may be to first grow 
the English-language version of the wiki, and then plan an initiative for translation into 
other languages. This should be a community effort.
A NIME sustainability framework
In the following, we propose a matrix that can be thought of as a systematic approach 
to raise awareness and engagement around ecological and environmental issues in 
NIME research practices. It is intended to be high level and adaptable to the diversity 
of NIME. This includes research spanning the arts and humanities, social and natural 
sciences, and engineering. It also includes artistic practices and the variety of 
intermedial approaches in between science and art. The model is presented in the 
following table and consists of two primary axes: the research stage and its resources.
Research stage
The horizontal axis represents the stage of research. While arranged roughly 
chronologically, in practice research tends to overlap, iterate and move between the 
different stages in nonlinear ways.
Research stage
Making Testing Using Disposing
Resources Materials
Consumables
Storage
Processing
Transport
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression NIME and the Environment: Toward a More Sustainable NIME Practice
15
The stages most closely represent the design cycle of a new NIME; however, it can be 
applied to most other research scenarios.
Resources
The vertical axis describes the basic categories of resources for which environmental 
impacts can be assessed and addressed. The actual items and steps towards 
environmental action will vary depending on the type of research practice.
The research stages and resources will significantly depend on the type of research 
practice, and not all stages and categories of resources will be present for all 
practices. However, we hope that most, if not all, NIME research activities can be 
mapped into the cells of this model and it can provide a framework for considering 
these topics in our day-to-day work.
We envision the NIME sustainability framework to complement the Eco Wiki. It can 
also serve as a way to organise the various stages and resource categories in the wiki 
with relevant information on specific research topics.
Making: Covering the design, construction, prototyping, coding, etc. of NIMEs, in 
both physical and digital domains.
Testing: Related to the testing of NIMEs, including in-progress rehearsals of new 
works.
Using: Depending on the context, this can include performance and execution of 
artistic and musical works, utilising tools in scientific research, carrying out studies 
and experiments. This could also extend to the dissemination of results: traveling to 
conferences to give presentations, publishing, and similar activities.
Disposing: Anything concerning end-of-life stages of a NIME (physical or digital).
Materials: Physical or digital elements used in the construction of new instruments, 
tools, or other artefacts developed within the context of NIME research and practice.
Consumables: Materials used in NIME research that are not part of an artefact.
Storage: Infrastructures for the storage and archiving of research-related data and 
assets, including local and cloud-based digital storage solutions.
Processing: Computational resources consumed in the carrying out of research, 
with consideration given to the energy sources used.
Transport: Any resources related to transportation, most importantly commuting 
and travel for research, touring, conferences and other global events. It also includes 
the transport of materials and consumables.

Conclusion
The fragile state of the environment is well recognised as one of the most acute crises 
of our time. Based on numerous conversations and discussions throughout the NIME 
community, and spurred by the online organisation of the NIME 2020 conference due 
to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we argue that careful consideration and direct 
action are necessary to address environmental issues in all facets of our research and 
creative practices.
In this paper, we provide an overview of how environmental sustainability and NIME 
practice intersect and lay out three primary contributions to the NIME community to 
prioritise environmental action in our collective work.
First, we investigated how environmental issues have been previously addressed in the 
NIME literature. Our systematic review of NIME proceedings revealed that active 
engagement with environmental issues in NIME research has been scarcely discussed: 
only 12 out of 1867 papers explicitly mention environmental topics.
Second, to address this lack of attention we have created the NIME Eco Wiki, a 
repository of information and resources on environmental issues for NIME 
researchers. It is in the early stages, but we invite the community to consult and 
contribute to the wiki. We hope that the resource can grow over time, and that the 
diversity of contributors and contributions will increase. Particular attention should be 
on implementing multilanguage support and ongoing collaboration with NIME’s ethics 
and diversity initiatives.
Finally, we suggest a NIME sustainability framework for the systematic inclusion of 
environmental action in NIME research practice. The framework is based on 
identifying stages of research and categories of resources used, and aims to be broad 
enough to allow for the rich diversity of practices that are carried out under the NIME 
umbrella. In coordination with the Eco Wiki it can hopefully lead to the discovery and 
implementation of practical measures to lessen our work’s ecological impact.
In conclusion, we offer this perspective from the NIME environmental statement:
As humans, we have a responsibility towards our environment and ecosystem. As 
artists and researchers, we have the ability to give voice to climate change and to 
confront and question damaging privileges and habits, through the development 
of new practices, technologies and infrastructures that lessen our planetary 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression NIME and the Environment: Toward a More Sustainable NIME Practice
17
impact. As individuals, our impact is negligible, but as a community, we can make 
a difference.
