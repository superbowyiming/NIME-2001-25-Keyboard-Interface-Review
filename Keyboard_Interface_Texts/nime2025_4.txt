Abstract
This paper presents five strategies for facilitating workshops that
incorporate AI text-to-image (TTI) generators in the conceptual
design of new musical instruments. Developed through a series
of iterative workshops, this approach examines the integration of
generative AI (GenAI) within creative processes, with a particular
focus on idea generation and the interplay between AI-driven
tools and traditional craft-based activities in workshop contexts.
The primary study was conducted at the Artificial Intelligence
and Musical Creativity Conference (AIMC ’23) [2] and the paper
shares insights from the workshop, including the combination
of physical prototyping and GenAI concept design through im-
age creation. The paper emphasises the practical implications of
incorporating AI tools into group design fiction workshops and
offers five suggestions for facilitators and practitioners. It consid-
ers the tensions and opportunities that arise in the collaboration
between AI and human creativity, underscoring the importance
of iterative feedback and the benefits of clearly defined design
briefs within speculative design practices.

means for exploring potential solutions to user-centred design
and interaction problems, encouraging participant engagement
in novel designs [14], and identifying research opportunities [4].
Speculative design activities and thought processes have been
the impetus of several HCI focused workshops [ 39] and have
been achieved through a range of techniques from creating arte-
facts from bricolage [ 10], sketching [34] and basic electronics
[32]. There are several examples of workshop formats that take
inspiration from design fiction methodologies by engaging with
the personal, extra-ordinary and absurd [26] due to the potential
to expand the scope for user engagement in workshop settings[4].
The use of speculative design has also previously been explored
for designing human-AI interactions [25] and fictional AI work-
shops that incorporate text-to-image tools to evaluate the use of
collectively designing prompts within group settings.
This paper focuses on the implications of integrating genera-
tive AI tools into the creative process, specifically for the context
of musical instrument design. The main objectives are to 1) share
our initial findings using AI tools within group design fiction
workshops and, 2) question how best to incorporate these new
technologies when developing new creative ideas or concepts.
In order to explore the potential of generative AI within design
methods for instrument design, a workshop was organised at the
Artificial Intelligence and Musical Creativity Conference at The
University of Sussex in August 2023. The outcomes of this work-
shop are presented in Section 5 alongside the initial findings from
the round table discussion which covers a range of topics around
the use of AI tools, iterative feedback in Creative Design and the
participants’ experience of the workshop. This paper seeks to
bridge the gap between discussions and practical applications,
offering insights for both researchers and practitioners exploring
AI and creativity within the context of new musical instrument
designs.
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Aynsley et al.
We present five novel workshop strategies integrating new AI
Text-to-Image (TTI) generators in the context of musical instru-
ment design workshops through the lens of a speculative future.
The approach presented in this paper has been developed over
several iterations of a workshop format and seeks to share the
potential of new GenAI tools for instrument designers.
2 Related Work
In this section, we explore the theoretical and practical contexts
that informed our study designs and methodologies. Specifically,
we introduce speculative design as a future-orientated design
approach, the use of a workshop format to design musical in-
struments and the capabilities of generative AI technologies in
creative and collaborative workshop settings.
2.1 Speculative Design
Speculative Design is a methodology coined by Dunne and Raby
which situates designers within unknown worlds to look beyond
identifying needs and solving problems, and instead move to-
wards a more “generative, speculative, and future-oriented space
of alternative possibilities” [13]. Speculative design has been used
previously in workshop settings to explore a variety of fields,
from practical design of urban technology [17] to having a social
and cultural role in generating conversations and solutions to
important social issues [28].
Most notably, speculative design has been explored within the
third wave of HCI as a future-orientated, critical design methodol-
ogy [13] that situates users in unfamiliar circumstances [38] [18].
A central tenet of speculative design is to accept that the product
of the design process may never become ‘real’. Moving away
from what is possible or achievable provides space to think from
an anti-solutionist perspective [ 4]. The resistance of impulses
towards solutionism is well explored within ‘Anti-Solutionist
Strategies: Seriously Silly Design Fiction’ which states that much
work around technology ideation “solves problems that don’t
exist or ignores the complexity of personal, political and environ-
mental issues” [10]. We situate our workshop plan within Partic-
ipatory and Collaborative design methods [21] which typically
acknowledge that people who are affected by a design decision,
event or product should have an opportunity to influence it. By
embracing a speculative design outlook within a collaborative
workshop setting, we are aiming to situate workshop participants
within a divergent thinking space [1] to encourage a large pool
of ideas which can later be used as a resource for further design
activities.
2.2 Musical Instrument Design Workshops
There are several noteworthy examples of musical instrument de-
sign workshops [4] [35] [7] [27]. These workshops explore many
perspectives within the design space, employing methodologies
that encourage the design of instruments from the absurd [26] to
the fun and ‘modern’ [11]. These exploratory workshops present
varying work plans that invite participants to ideate, think about
and imagine the future of musical instruments. One notable ex-
ample is the Magic Machines workshop, conceived and executed
by Kristina Andersen et al [4]. This workshop introduces an inno-
vative approach that prioritises the participants’ experience over
the conventional workshop outcome driven approach. Featured
in the workshop plan is a technique that involves constraining
workshop activities to a short timeframe, fostering quick and
arguably instinctive actions among participants.
2.3 Generative AI
Recent advances in generative AI have enabled highly detailed
and realistic images to be generated from text prompts given in
natural language [9]. The tools used in this study use generative
AI technology such as Stable Diffusion [31] and Midjourney [29]
for image generation, and large language model-based models
such as ChatGPT [20] for text-based suggestions. Image genera-
tors can replicate a wide range of artistic styles, from established
movements like ’Impressionism’ to more contemporary aesthet-
ics such ’3D rendering’. They can also combine multiple stylistic
elements and subjects, allowing for complex and highly customis-
able outputs.
The ethical implications of the training data of these large AI
models is a much discussed topic due to the potential for the
infringement of copyright [ 24] and intellectual property [ 23].
Furthermore, generative AI models are often seen as neutral,
but they have been criticised for producing biased outcomes,
which can inherently perpetuate stereotypes, discrimination and
can unfairly disadvantage certain groups [16]. In addition to bias,
there is a also criticism that Generative AI tools leave a significant
carbon footprint due to the energy intensive nature of training
and using these systems [12] [19].
The collaboration between humans and AI has become a sub-
ject of increasing significance in real world creative applications
[3] and the use case of these new technologies is stimulating
conversations about intellectual property the originality of ideas
[22] [6], as well as new dynamics of human art making [30].
The capability of new generative AI tools in creating seemingly
complete, albeit often implausible designs has led to them being
used in a manner we term “instant design” (as quoted by one of
our workshop participants), where the entire human input to the
design process is in the contribution of a text prompt. In contrast
to this “instant design”, we are interested in is how GenAI tools
can be used within a wider design process as opposed to being
the design process.
2.4 Generative AI in Creative and Workshop
Settings
The use of AI tools within group settings is a growing topic that
has previously been explored in workshops such as Vartiainen et
al. ’s study [37] that explores the use of TTI generators as a basis
to explore a variety of craft materials in Finnish education. The
study implements a hands-on workshop approach and discusses
the tensions of adopting Generative AI within workshop settings.
Interestingly, they state that ‘AI may assist the ideation process
by providing new perspectives and visualising the possible and
the impossible’ [37]. This has been used to the advantage in other
workshop topics that explore fictional situations in relation to
the participants. An example of this is Epstein et al. ’s workshop
where participants are asked to collectively imagine utopias facil-
itated by AI-generated imagery. [15] Interestingly, the findings
highlight the unexpected difference between the participant’s
imagined output and the generated image were the most talked
about insights into the use of these novel tools[ 15]. Although
there is a significant increase in workshops exploiting GenAI
within workshop settings, the use of these tools for instrument
designers working within the field of NIME and beyond is little
explored.

2.5 Author’s Related Workshops
The authors of this paper have been central to several previous
workshops that explored fictional design, digital musical instru-
ments, and the accessibility of novel interfaces. This experience
has influenced the workshop design described in this paper as
well as the narrative, activities and approach. A brief overview
of the previous workshops is started below.
2.5.1 Workshop A at Joy of Sound. This workshop was at-
tended by Disabled participants affiliated with the inclusive arts
organisation Joy of Sound (JOS) in January 2023. The workshop
included activities that invited participants to co-create concep-
tual images of new instruments using AI TTI generators by pro-
viding key words for the prompt. These included the overall
appearance of the instrument, constituent materials, and other
design characteristics of the instruments. This workshop was the
central topic of a paper [8] which was presented at NIME 2023.
2.5.2 Workshop B at NIME 2023. The second workshop was
hosted at the NIME conference in Mexico City in May 2023.
The workshop was attended by 7 conference attendees and the
activities included an introduction to AI image creation tools;
Image creation using generative AI TTI tools and time to compose
audio that accompanies the new instruments. This workshop
used AI tools through the lens of a Digital Luthier and questioned
how AI rendered images can directly influence new instrument
designs.
2.5.3 Workshop C: The 10,000 Instruments Workshop.
This third workshop was held in July 2020 at NIME Conference
with the aim of questioning “...the role of technology in creative
practice through make-believe, fragile and contradictory artefacts
and playful design explorations”. The lofty but unachievable
aim was to create thousands of new instrument ideas, which
participants took seriously and did their best to achieve.
3 The Central Study:AIMC Workshop
3.1 Context of the Workshop
The qualitative data for this study was collected at the AIMC Con-
ference at the University of Sussex in August 2023. The workshop
was advertised through the conference website and attendees
could sign up for free. The workshop was named after an instru-
ment which was developed in a workshop A by the lead author as
“A Synth made of Chicken Nuggets you Play with your Elbows”:
A workshop exploring AI supported Musical Instrument Design.
3.2 Participants
In total, there were ten workshop participants, and six facilitators
present at the study. Participants were asked to bring “one non-
musical item with them” which was to be used in the introductory
section of the workshop.
3.3 Workshop Materials
Within the workshop space, there was a projector that was used
to show pre-arranged slides and every participant had access
to their own computer. The facilitators provided craft materials
(see figure 2) which were laid out on tables around the room.
The materials included Styrofoam, colouring pens, rubber bands,
pom-poms, moulding clay, crayons, tapes, scissors, and more. The
selection of craft materials was deliberate, offering participants
an array of options to create mock-ups representing a broad
range of shapes and forms throughout the activities.
Figure 2: Workshop craft materials which were laid out of
on participant’s tables
We encouraged participants to use a variety of TTI generators
as well as provided an easy-to-use tool that was not limited
by signup requirements or limited credits. We used the paid
subscription of MidJourney v5 [33], which is accessed through
the chat interface “Discord” [5].
4 AIMC Workshop Outline
The workshop had various stages, including an overview of AI
tools, instrument generation, extended AI techniques, instrument
mock-ups, a presentation opportunity, before a concluding round-
table discussion. The workshop schedule was as follows:
Warm-up (10 mins)Participants were asked to place their
non musical object in the middle of their table, craft a brief de-
scription of one of the objects, and subsequently pass the de-
scriptions to the neighboring table. Participants were asked to
interpret the description and create a mock-up or physical sketch
of their design using the craft materials.
Overview of AI Tools (30 mins)Participants were intro-
duced to a range of AI tools, including ChatGPT, Midjourney,
DALL-E 2 and Bing. Participants were encouraged to try out ones
they were less familiar with.
Instrument Generation (30 mins)Participants were tasked
with creating a plethora of novel instruments, drawing inspi-
ration from personal objects. To enhance the process, prompts
and images were incorporated into a live feed showcasing a con-
tinuous stream of evolving instruments, fostering a dynamic
environment for “prompt remixing. ” This live feed was hosted
within a collaborative file named the ‘Compendium of Imaginary
Musical Instruments, ’ allowing everyone to upload their creations
to a shared space in real-time, facilitating the immediate viewing
and interaction with each other’s contributions.
Instrument Themes (45 mins)Following an introduction to
extended AI techniques like in/out-painting, participants collec-
tively organised instruments into ‘families’. This process aimed
to familiarise participants with designs, identify higher-level sim-
ilarities and themes, and encourage the exploration of unexplored
areas in the design space.
Instrument Mock-ups (45 mins)Participants were encour-
aged to craft low-fidelity prototypes of their designs using basic
materials such as foam board, card, and paper prototyping.
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Aynsley et al.
Show and Tell (30 mins)Participants engaged in a brief
show and tell of the final instruments, followed by a round-table
discussion reflecting on the workshop process. Discussion topics
included various aspects of the process and the broader implica-
tions of integrating AI tools into the creative process of musical
instrument designers.
5 Workshop Outcomes
5.1 Instrument Themes and Categorisation
During the workshop, participants were invited to a collabo-
rative task of organising their 99 instrument inventions into
distinct themes within the ‘Compendium of Imaginary Musical
Instruments. ’ This exercise served a dual purpose of fostering in-
workshop reflection and facilitating group discussions through
reflection, co-analysis, and categorisation of their instrument
designs. The resulting themes cover various concepts, from aes-
thetic attributes such as ‘Steampunk’ to functional elements such
as ‘Drivable Instruments’ and sensory experiences such as ‘Odor-
ous’ and ‘Edible Instruments’ (see Figure 3).
Figure 3: Four selections of musical instruments made by
participants under the ‘Edible Instruments’ theme
Despite inevitable overlaps, self-organising the outcomes of
the workshop allowed for a more nuanced understanding of the
range of designs among the group.
Below are the most prevalent categories and the respective
number of instruments arranged into each section:
• Wearable Instruments: 19 designs
• Steampunk Instruments: 16 designs
• Edible Instruments: 11 designs
This distribution suggests a range of motivations, from imag-
inative and whimsical ideas, such as the Sinister Instruments,
to more practical and feasible designs, exemplified by Wearable
Instruments (see Figure 4).
Post-workshop we extracted common prompting patterns (see
Figure 5), with the aim of visually capturing the common trends
Figure 4: Four selections of musical instruments made by
participants under the ‘Wearable Instruments’ theme
and interests that emerged during the workshop. Notably, partic-
ipants often specified the instruments based on material, method
of producing sound, or the intended user, as well as visual cues.

In addition to the common trends above, many of the partici-
pants specified how the instrument should sound as shown in
the prompts below:
"Instant Design": Five Strategies for the use of Generative AI in NIME Ideation Workshops NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia
• “A new musical instrument that converts stomach diges-
tion sounds into light and music”
• “A hybrid electronic-biological musical instrument, that
uses its tentacles to make sound. ”
• “Massive gongs suspended beneath the water’s surface that
resonate deeply when hit by powerful waves, producing a
majestic and awe-inspiring sound. ”
• “A fantastical stringed instrument that requires the player
to scream at the top of their lungs for any sound to play.
The sound it makes is terrifying, but very quiet. ”
• “A musical instrument based on a flower, where each petal
makes a different sound. ”
Figure 6: An AI image of a example of a build-able musical
instrument named‘Chord Key’
Finally, the materials used for the instruments were a key con-
sideration, ranging from unconventional sources like insects and
money to more conventional materials like wood and concrete.
Some workshop designs were unfeasible, but others provided
practical references for fabrication. Figure 6 shows an instru-
ment from the workshop that was entitled ‘Chord Key’, which
represents one of the more practical instrument designs.
5.2 Physical Prototyping
The workshop included a phase of physical prototyping, inviting
participants to make mock-ups of their designs. The physical
outcomes of this activity enabled the group to think about scale,
materiality and feel of the instrument in a different way to the
2D images. See Figure 7 which shows participants demonstrating
their physical prototypes alongside the initial image concept.
6 Developing Strategies
In this section, we describe the development of the five strate-
gies. The process began with a round-table discussion between
workshop organisers and participants at the end of the session.
This discussion was recorded, transcribed, and anonymised. We
then conducted multiple rounds of critical reflection, analysing
the transcript to identify key themes emerging from participants’
Figure 7: Workshop participants with their craft mock-ups
of the AI Generated Instrument called ’SnapSonix’
contributions. Below, we present three themes that formed the
foundation for the five strategies outlined in section 7.
6.1 Theme 1: Clear Briefs and Constraints:
Balancing Creativity and Clarity
The discussions revealed a nuanced perspective on the balance
between speculative design and the need for clearer design brief
parameters. While acknowledging the nature of speculative de-
sign methods, participants expressed a desire for more defined
design briefs and constraints. Participant four (P4) noted, “I think
it’d be more fun doing it if we had a clear brief. So, design a
new instrument, if it was like designing a new instrument for
bouncing, and then everyone works. ”
In addition to the desire for clearer design briefs, the limita-
tions of the AI tools themselves were brought to the forefront.
P4 emphasised the essential role of constraints, stating, “When
I’m thinking of designing a musical instrument, I need to have
some constraints... I think it’s more productive to give the model
a starting point. ” This sentiment reinforces the workshop’s ex-
ploration of the delicate balance between creative freedom and
the need for structured guidance.
6.2 Theme 2: Limitations of Technology:
Exploring Constraints in Design Ideation
While the workshop successfully introduced and used TTI gen-
erators for conceptualising new instruments, the participants
raised valid concerns about the limitations inherent in designing
exclusively through prompts. Criticism regarding the constraints
imposed by the technology, hindering some participants from
fully realising their design visions. Expressing frustration with
these limitations, P1 shared, “I really wanted to make the thing ac-
tually playable, you know, like, yeah, like, I really tried to put like
some sort of membrane. ” This view emphasises the participants’
aspirations to move beyond conceptualisation and refine the de-
sign, highlighting the need to address technology constraints in
future design iterations.
6.3 Theme 3: Grounding Speculative Designs
The challenges associated with grounding speculative designs
became evident in the post workshop discussions. While the spec-
ulative nature of the workshop allowed for exploration through
many topics and ideas, participants recognised the importance
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Aynsley et al.
of transitioning towards real-world considerations. As P4 artic-
ulated, “But when you design an instrument right now, do you
actually, would you actually need to see a picture of the finalised
product?” This quote prompts a thoughtful reflection on the ne-
cessity of visual representation in the early stages of instrument
design and aligns with the broader conversation on balancing
speculative creativity with practical design considerations.
7 Five Strategies for the Use of AI Tools within
Musical Instrument Design Workshops
Based on the findings from the post workshop discussion and
our experience from running several fictional AI musical instru-
ment workshops, we propose five strategies for practitioners
facilitating future workshops:
Strategy 1: Provide Clear Activity Briefs and Starting
Points Provide participants with a clear and specific brief to
guide their creative process. Introduce constraints that help focus
on practical aspects, such as playability, materials, potential users
or context of use.
Strategy 2: Consider How Speculative the Designs Should
Be Encourage storytelling and fictional elements into the design
process, encouraging participants to create backstories for their
instruments and imagine what it will sound like if brought to the
physical world. We suggest establishing speculative designs by
introducing real-world considerations like feasibility, playability
and materials later in the workshop. Guide participants to think
about the practical implications and applications of their designs.
Strategy 3: Structure Tasks Around Collaborative En-
gagement Promote collaborative design amongst the partici-
pants by facilitating discussions to refine and evolve ideas. Create
common documents to work from which participants can access
and return to. Ask small groups of participants to make a craft
mock-up of a chosen instrument to collectively encourage further
discussions.
Strategy 4: Encourage Iterative Interaction with AI tools
Encourage participants to interact with the AI model iteratively,
asking questions and seeking detailed descriptions. Make sure
the participants are aware of methods of iterating on a design
(in-painting, out-painting, re-use of prompts etc). Consider tools
that allow participants to steer the AI model more effectively
toward desired outcomes. We found that iterative design with AI
tools is useful to participants due to the unpredictability of the
first few outcomes.
Strategy 5: Involve Physical Materials and ActivitiesWe
found that the use of physical objects in the workshop addressed
some of the challenges mentioned in the findings from Work-
shop A in Section 2.5.1 and encouraged participants to move
away from gestures associated to existing instruments to a new
found gestural space. Create craft mock-ups of the AI generated
designs within the workshop to help participants think about
the scale of their designs, as well as decisions about other design
considerations such as gestural control and mapping strategies.
Ask the participants to present their craft mockups alongside the
AI generated images to give plenty of material to convey their
design ideas.
These five strategies aim to enhance the overall experience of
using AI models in creative workshops, balancing the speculative
and practical aspects of design processes whilst fostering an
effective collaboration with the new technologies.
8 Discussion
The findings from prior workshops conducted by the authors;
Workshop A 2.5.1, Workshop B 2.5.2, and Workshop C 2.5.3 pro-
vided essential context and experience that informed the de-
velopment of the five strategies outlined above. Two of these
workshops explored the integration of AI tools in co-design and
speculative design practices, particularly within the design of
new NIMEs. In contrast, Workshop C focused on developing a
broad range of musical instruments using traditional craft mock-
ups alongside electronic components.
A key insight that shaped Strategy 3 was the use of a shared
slide deck with a set template to structure the ideation process
from Workshop C. We observed that participants duplicated,
edited, and rearranged slides freely, allowing for an organic colli-
sion and melding of diverse concepts and ideas. Another signifi-
cant finding, which informed Strategy 1, was the role of physical
objects in participants’ immediate environments in seeding ideas.
Participants often combined two readily available objects, quickly
assembling and photographing them before adding them to the
slide deck. This process helped ground design concepts in tangi-
ble, familiar materials.
Whilst Workshops A and B provided a platform to trial novel
AI TTI generators with a range of instrument makers and musi-
cians, incorporating physical craft mock-ups of the instrument
designs, inspired by Workshop C, was a key focus. Generative
AI facilitated expansive idea generation, yet participants noted
the difficulty in transitioning from AI-generated images to im-
ages of realistic, playable instruments and physical prototyping
activities helped ground the speculative ideas. By refining these
approaches, we hope that facilitators can create more structured
and meaningful interactions between participants and AI tools
within workshop settings.
However, the AIMC workshop also revealed challenges and
considerations for future iterations. Participants expressed a de-
sire for clearer design briefs and constraints, highlighting the
need for a balance between speculative and focused direction.
The limitations of the AI tools were acknowledged, with partici-
pants desiring more constraints and productive starting points.
The workshop discussion highlighted the importance of itera-
tive design with AI tools and the consideration of feasibility,
playability, and materials in the design process.
Whilst this series of workshops demonstrate the creative po-
tential of AI tools from an instrument design perspective, where
AI tools can help expand ideation and support diverse participa-
tion, they also highlighted the importance of critically engaging
with the limitations and ethical implications of the tools. As these
technologies become further embedded into co-design practices,
considerations around bias, authorship, and the longer-term im-
pact on creative agency and AI tools should be considered. Testing
these tools in practice allowed us to explore their benefits while
also navigating the complex ethical terrain in which they are
situated. For example, over 90% of the images depicting people
in the compendium were white, despite no prompts indicating
the subjects’ ethnicity or nationality. Future workshop iterations
should continue to question the ethical use of these tools, whilst
seeking to use responsible and transparent technologies that are
aligned with the values of the participants and facilitators.
9 Conclusion
Our exploration of “Instant Design” strategies for the use of
generative AI in speculative ideation workshops builds upon

the authors’ experience in facilitating workshops in fictional
design and musical instruments. The workshop described in this
paper provided insights from previous workshops, to propose
an engaging approach to integrate generative AI tools into the
creative process of musical instrument design.
To guide future workshops, we proposed five strategies based
on post-workshop discussions and the authors’ collective expe-
rience. These strategies aim to enhance the overall workshop
experience, fostering effective collaboration between participants
and generative AI tools while maintaining a balance between
speculative exploration and practical design considerations.
