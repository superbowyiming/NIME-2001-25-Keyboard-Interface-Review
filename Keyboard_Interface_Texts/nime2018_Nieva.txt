ABSTRACT
This paper presents the work to maintain several copies of
the digital musical instrument (DMI) called the T-Stick in
the hopes of extending their useful lifetime. The T-Sticks
were originally conceived in 2006 and 20 copies have been
built over the last 12 years. While they all preserve the orig-
inal design concept, their evolution resulted in variations in
choice of microcontrollers, and sensors. We worked with
eight copies of the second and fourth generation T-Sticks to
overcome issues related to the aging of components, changes
in external software, lack of documentation, and in general,
the problem of technical maintenance.

1. INTRODUCTION
The digital era has accelerated the appearance of controllers
and synthesizers to form a community around the concept
of DMI use and design [2]. Despite the proliferation of
creative new instruments, digital technology poses the in-
evitable problem of obsolescence. Deprecated and aging
electronic components, communication protocols, operating
systems updates, upgrades, and software compatibility all
add to potential causes of DMI malfunction.
An interesting example on how to navigate the issues
of rapid technological change is that of Michel Waisvisz’s
The Hands [3] which was used in performances for approx-
imately 25 years. Unfortunately, not all DMI developers
beneﬁt from technical support similar to that provided by
STEIM. Even though there is no intentional planned obso-
lescence in DMIs, it does still occur.
In order to tackle this problem of non-functioning instru-
ments in research laboratories, we decided to work on one
unique instrument that as of now is more than 12 years old:
the T-Stick [1]. This DMI was conceived and developed at

the Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (ID-
MIL) at McGill University and has been used in music per-
formances, research, and DMI design education in graduate
seminars. It has been adopted by expert performers and
composers as part of their musical practice including D. An-
drew Stewart1 (Soprano user) and Fernando Rocha2 (Tenor
user). It has appeared in dozens of public appearances in
countries such as Canada, USA, Brazil, among others.3 The
aim of this article is to report on the recent work done to
keep the family of instruments operative.
2. THE T-STICK FAMILY OF DMIs
The T-Stick is a family of instruments since it was origi-
nally conceived in diﬀerent sizes and weights that resemble
a family of acoustic instruments. There are ﬁve models: So-
pranino, Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass. There are diﬀer-
ences in electronic design among the instrument generations
but they maintain the same DMI design concept related to
the gestures used to perform with the instrument.
The T-Stick was designed to have a robust physical inter-
face usually made of ABS plumbing pipe with a diameter
of 5cm and protected with shrinking tube (Fig. 1). It pro-
vides integral sensing and mapping which is intended to
provide a logical and discoverable response to the player’s
actions. Low entry fee [4] was not prioritized; the instru-
ment requires training and practice to reach a signiﬁcant
level of virtuosity 4. For this paper we have worked with
eight instruments that belong to three models of T-Sticks:
the Sopranino, Soprano and Tenor versions. See Table 1.

3. HARDWARE MAINTENANCE
The state of the instruments was divided in two groups: 5
were shrink-tubed without identiﬁed driver software and 3
were open in pieces. The goal of our hardware maintenance
process was to ensure functional serial communication be-
tween the DMI and host computer. This would ensure the
hardware was working properly and that we could continue
onto revising the driver software. See process in Fig. 2.

Serial communication was tested for the ﬁrst group with
original archived driver software. 3 Sopranos 2G and the
GX passed the process to ﬁgure out its internal conﬁgura-
tion and match it with diﬀerent versions of existing ﬁrmware
also archived in the laboratory database. This testing was
performed by probing the microcontroller EEPROM for in-
formation on connection pins and revision of elementary
sensor data coming back from the DMI. For example, know-
ing that there was an accelerometer installed, the DMI
would be tilted in diﬀerent directions to determine the po-
sition of the sensor inside of the instrument. This was im-
portant since we could keep the instrument as it was with
the shrinking tube in place. The Tenor allowed for commu-
nication but no sensor data was being sent so it had to be
opened.
The Tenor and the second group of T-Sticks (Soprano
2G and 4G, and Sopranino) underwent electronic diagnos-
tics and repair. Re-soldering, re-wiring, voltage supply and
continuity tests were done in order to enable communica-
tion with the computer. If these repairs allowed for data
transfer then the same process of probing was performed.
On the other hand, even if the repairs did not allow for data
transfer, an upgraded version of the ﬁrmware was re-ﬂashed
into the microcontroller (since now we had access to the in-
ternal connections of the instrument and ﬁrmware could be
written for it).
Going through the process of repairing the instruments
allowed us to inspect the hardware components. We cata-
loged all of them in detail and took note of the wiring of
the instrument, and relevant information that now is part
of the technical speciﬁcations of each DMI 5.
4. SOFTWARE HOMOGENIZATION
The heart of the sensor data acquisition and control is based
on the Arduino ecosystem. The original ﬁrmware was writ-
ten in the IDE version 00xx which is no longer supported.
Information on ﬁrmware version and date, as well as sen-
sor organization and conﬁguration of the T-Stick is saved
in the microcontroller’s EEPROM. We have updated some
of the ﬁrmware to work with IDE version 1.8.3 to re-ﬂash
instruments that were refurbished and allow for consistency
among all of them. Each T-Stick model has speciﬁc ﬁrmware.
The instruments communicate with the host computer via
a USB to serial IC adapter. In the host computer there is a
driver patch developed in Max/MSP that implements serial
communication with the microcontroller board, parses the
data received and sends conﬁguration data back to the mi-
crocontroller that can be written to EEPROM when needed.
The data received in the host computer are then formatted
with Open Sound Control (OSC) addresses for data pro-
cessing and gesture extraction. All the communication is
done in OSC format from this stage on.
Due to the nature of each T-Stick, each copy has a cus-
tomized software driver so that all the sensor data is exposed
in libmapper6, a software library to connect interactive me-
dia control systems. This did not prevent us from homog-
enizing the data ﬂow process in all the patches and deliver
the raw and processed signals in a structured form.
5. CONCLUSIONS
The ﬁght for maintaining a rather old DMI allows for its
availability for researchers, artists, and students. Facing
this problem in the context of the T-Stick, showed us the
importance of reﬁning our decisions: how much should one
change things, how much should we keep as is, having in
mind that one of the most important things is to maintain
the original concept of the instrument. Documenting and
designing with community supported open-source electronic
platforms aid in the maintenance process. Building multi-
ple copies systematizes electronic design and leverages DMI
craft expertise, especially if it is done as part of a pedagog-
ical endeavor. As in traditional instrument lutherie, digital
lutherie should be a balance of science and art.
