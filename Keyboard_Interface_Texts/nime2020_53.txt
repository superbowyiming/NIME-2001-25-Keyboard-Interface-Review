ABSTRACT
Iterative design methods involving children and educators
are diﬃcult to conduct, given both the ethical implications
and time commitments understandably required. The qual-
itative design process presented here recruits introductory
teacher training students, in order to discover useful design
insights relevant to music education technologies ‘by proxy’.
Thus, some of the barriers present in child-computer inter-
action research are avoided.
As an example, the method is applied to the creation of a
block-based music notation system, named Codetta. Build-
ing upon successful educational technologies that intersect
both music and programming, Codetta seeks to enable child
composition, whilst aiding generalist educators’ conﬁdence
in teaching music.

1. INTRODUCTION
When designing an interactive system, a user-centred ap-
proach is paramount. In particular, iterative approaches
emphasise the importance of the end-user, involving them
continuously throughout the development process [18]. How-
ever, in the ﬁeld of child-computer interaction (CCI) there
are many barriers towards adopting such an approach. For
example, continually working alongside children has under-
standable ethical implications [21]. Furthermore, the de-
sign process must be adopted by educators who, already,
are struggling to balance a challenging workload [6, 4].
The method presented and discussed in this paper aims
to gather valuable insights towards designing interfaces for
music education, whilst avoiding the ethical challenges and
time constraints present in CCI research. This method does
not intend to replace child-led design processes, nor belittle

the importance of ethical approval. Instead, the intention
is to contribute an approach to support the development of
working prototypes, particularly in situations where engag-
ing with children is very diﬃcult or impossible.
To demonstrate the method, it is applied to the devel-
opment of a block-based music composition tool, named
Codetta. Codetta looks to increase child participation in
music composition, in part focusing on the rationale that
many generalist educators lack conﬁdence in teaching mu-
sic; they believe that music is a skill only for knowledgeable
specialists [9, 11] and, thus, are deterred from engaging in
open-ended activities (such as composition) [10, 8].
In summary, Codetta is developed alongside two student-
teacher collaborators instead of directly involving child end-
users. An iterative design process is used, triangulating
the think-aloud protocol, interviews and discourse analysis
(DA). Although the design implications stemming from the
student-teacher’s feedback presented here apply to Codetta,
the method is applicable for designing any educational
music interface.
2. BACKGROUND
Before starting to design digital systems for learning music,
it is important to consider how children acquire musical
skills, and how their skills are developed in pedagogies.
Often, music pedagogies delay the learning of notation
and music theory in place of learning musical structures
implicitly by ear. For example, a concept central to Gor-
don’s Music Learning Theory is audiation: one’s ability to
recall sounds in their head when no actual sound is present.
Gordon argues that audiation is a key characteristic in de-
termining a child’s musical aptitude, and that musical apti-
tude is not highly correlated with intelligence nor academic
achievement [22].
The Kod´ aly Method is a pedagogy which follows a child-
developmental approach [7]. This means that the pedagogi-
cal content is arranged to follow children’s growing abilities;
initially, emphasis is placed on learning rhythms (via phys-
ical activities) before moving onto understanding melodies
(via singing activities).
In both of these pedagogies, children ﬁrst develop their
basic musical awareness before accumulating enough tools
to engage in composition activities. With regard to de-
veloping Codetta — where the goal is to facilitate chil-
dren in composition digitally — the design process must be
applied with the assumption that it is possible to adequately
accelerate childrens’ musical skills using technology.
2.1 LOGO-Inspired Systems
The MIT mathematician Papert created one of the ﬁrst dig-
ital solutions for engaging children in open-ended tasks [17],
which is regarded as a seminal work in CCI. Named LOGO,

the system allowed children to tinker with simple commands
that controlled the movement of a virtual ‘turtle’; as the tur-
tle moved it drew lines onto the screen. Thus, as children
played with LOGO and explored the many shapes that were
possible to draw, they unwittingly accelerated their mathe-
matical, problem-solving and computational-thinking skills.
With regard to music composition, LOGO-inspired sys-
tems are ideal as they aﬀord both problem-seeking and
problem-solving. Thus, many music-speciﬁc adaptations
have been successfully developed (see [12]).
Scratch [13] is a block-based system inspired by LOGO
that was designed to teach newcomers to programming. In
Scratch, users control a ‘sprite’ by snapping together colour-
ful puzzle-shaped blocks. Widely adopted to support de-
livery of the computer science curriculum, the block-based
drag-and-drop GUI supports ease of use, with the notches,
bumps and colours of blocks signifying how they interact
with each other [23].
Codetta builds on Scratch, placing the block-based pro-
gramming paradigm within the context of music creation.
The software aims to capitalise on the playful nature of
LOGO-inspired systems, whilst taking advantage of the learn-
ability of a block-based graphical interface. It is theorised
that the character of LOGO-inspired systems will allow chil-
dren to compose without needing to build traditional mu-
sical skills. Instead, children will intrinsically explore the
system and discover what works. A full epistemological dis-
cussion is beyond the scope of this paper, although, the
interested reader is pointed to [17].
Notably, one example of an explorable interface that has
successfully helped novices compose is Manhattan [14]. Man-
hattan uses the spreadsheet paradigm to embed high-level
formulas within a trackers low-level music editing system
and, thus, aﬀords a scalable challenge.
2.2 Related Design Methods
Many CCI researchers have explored various design pro-
cesses to develop educational technologies for creative dis-
ciplines. Some methodologies are discussed here with the
aim to simply emphasise the challenges of CCI research.
An in-depth critique is not intended.
Within computer science, Gomes, Falc˜ ao and Tedesco
[19] explored how the interaction elements of digital games
could contribute to childrens’ learning of programming con-
cepts. Notably, many of the games investigated followed
the block-based paradigm. Their method consisted of us-
ing unstructured interviews, semi-structured interviews and
participant observation, which successfully contributed
many design ideas. However, the generalisability of the
study is limited to the group investigated (four private school
groups, aged 5-7 years, living in Brazil), and a consider-
able commitment was required of both the children’s and
educator’s time.
Using the novelty of music to motivate the learning of
computer science concepts, Sonic Pi [1] is a domain speciﬁc
programming language that has been successfully
integrated into a creative pedagogy [2]. The language was
commissioned by the Raspberry Pi Foundation who, due
to their strategic ambitions, allocated only three-weeks for
development. Advantageously, this meant that less bur-
den was placed on the involvement of children and educa-
tors. On the other hand, many initial design decisions (such
as the ruby-based syntax) consequently coincided with the
developer’s current research and expertise, but not end-user
feedback.
In music education, Nouwen et al. [16] developed a par-
ticipatory design method for creating an educational digi-
tal music game, speciﬁcally focusing on singing pitches in
time with a given rhythm. Although many useful design re-
quirements were found, the development process was not
without diﬃculty: midway through development project
partners changed, shifting focus from ages 8-12 to 6-10.
3. METHOD
In developing Codetta, the aim was to devise an iterative
design process which placed the majority of the burden on
the researcher and did not require undergoing a lengthy
ethical approval process. However, the method must still
adequately provide insights that are relevant for designing
a child-friendly learnable system.
A qualitative approach was devised such that a (resource
eﬃcient) smaller-sample size could elicit rich and detailed
descriptive data. Two ﬁrst year BA(Hons) Primary Educa-
tion students were recruited following an advertisement at
the end of an introductory lecture on ‘Teaching and Learn-
ing’. They will be referred to as P1 and P2 throughout
this paper. Theoretically, both the participant’s knowl-
edge of taught degree content and experience from primary-
school placements would contribute valuable insight con-
cerning Codetta’s design, whilst the participants were
broadly more available than practising educators.
A brief questionnaire to gather information about the par-
ticipant’s prior musical and technical experience was con-
ducted. The participants were conﬁdent about teaching in
general, but not so conﬁdent in teaching music and even less
conﬁdent writing music. Additionally, the participants self-
doubted their musical experiences, adding comments un-
dermining their achievements. For example, P2 noted that
“it’s been a while” since they played piano.
In order to ensure that the procedure was mindful of the
student-teacher’s workload, four 45 minute iterations were
to be conducted at times organised with the participants.
The session length was agreed to by the head of the uni-
versity’s ‘Education and Childhood’ department prior to
recruitment. Additionally, a pilot session was conducted
before the student-teacher’s sessions, using two music tech-
nology students.
For each iteration, a process was followed triangulating
the think-aloud protocol, interviews and Stowell, Plumbley
and Bryan-Kinn’s DA method [20]. The process is sum-
marised here, with an overview shown in Figure 1. For
more precise detail about the individual steps of the DA
method, the reader is pointed to [20].

3.1 Think-Aloud Protocol
The think-aloud protocol was chosen for multiple reasons.
Firstly, by externalising their thought processes, a deep in-
sight could be obtained from the participants. The partic-
ipants burden was minimised also; they were only required
to perform tasks once whilst their interactions could be re-
played by the researcher at any time. Plus, the researcher
provided the equipment and controlled the environment,
meaning the participants did not have to prepare anything
beforehand.
For each session, the student-teachers followed a written
tutorial prepared by the researcher, focusing on a particu-
lar musical concept. Built into the software, each tutorial
ensured that any new developments to the program, or de-
vised hypothesis, were tested. Although no exact plan was
followed, the researcher’s background likely had a passive in-
ﬂuence on the devised didactic material. Furthermore, the
participants were isolated from one another and recorded in
a random order each time.
3.2 Interview
After the think-aloud, the researcher would also ask some
questions to probe any theories uncovered by the results
from the previous iteration. Thus, there is a further op-
portunity for the researcher to gather opinions on design
changes or hypothesises. The interviews were informal,
short and purposeful (lasting approximately 5 minutes).
3.3 T ranscription & Itemisation
The transcription of the think-aloud and interviews pro-
vided the raw text for the DA. By performing the full
transcription (including noting all visual detail), the
researcher advantageously immersed themselves in the
text [3]. Therefore, they also noted their immediate thoughts
after transcription (see ‘Free Association’ in [20]).
The Stowell, Plumbley and Bryan-Kinns’s DA method
[20] was chosen as it targets the evaluation of musical inter-
faces whilst, like the think-aloud, it provides a low cost in
participants’ time and resources. To put it simply, the DA
method required the researcher to break each ‘object’ down
into an itemised list, in order to identify the most common
occurrences in the text.
3.4 Reconstruction of Described W orld &
Examining Context
Finally (as in [20]), a reconstruction of each participant’s
world is written up as a text description, before being com-
bined into a single comparison (‘examining context’). Here
the aim is to provide enough detail to develop hypotheses
and software implementations for the next iteration.
4. RESUL TS
In this section, the highlights of the ﬁndings from each it-
eration are presented, alongside the goals the researcher set
for the iteration and the focus of the tutorial. A summary
of the key results and consequent design implications are
found in Table 1. As it is challenging to visualise the inter-
actions with Codetta from just this paper alone, the reader
is invited to view the video demonstrations1.
4.1 First Iteration (Pilot)
As shown in Figure 2, the ﬁrst prototype for Codetta con-
sisted of a basic drag and drop interface, where blocks could
be connected to one another, notated (using a click-based
music notation engine) and executed by pressing play (or

Figure 2: The initial interface used in the pilot
study.
cancelled using the stop button). A starting block is indi-
cated by a speaker icon, which needs to be connected to a
bar (containing music notation) in order to create sound.
The goal for this iteration was to test the devised method-
ology with pilot study participants (music technology
students). Towards this, the tutorial explored the ﬁrst steps
needed to create sound using Codetta and asked the
participants to recreate twinkle-twinkle little star, building
their notation skills.
The use of traditional music notation is somewhat
inspired by Manhattan [14], aiming to provide a low-level
editing mechanism, in order to support novice users. Hence,
notes are added to a bar by selecting the desired note length
from a pop-up menu (shown in Figure 3), and then the pitch
can be changed via two up and down arrows.
4.2 Second & Third Iteration
Figure 3: The second iteration’s design change for
the representation of note values.
The goal for the second iteration was to gather ﬁrst
impressions from the student-teacher participants, using the
same tutorial as in the pilot study. As outlined in Table 1,
initial usability issues were successfully discovered through
the DA. Notably, clues were drawn from participant’s body
language that were helpful in judging their conﬁdence lev-
els. Furthermore, it was found that P2 was much more
comfortable using numeric terminology, informing the re-
vised pop-up menu design (see Figure 3).
The third iteration provided an opportunity to investigate
a frequent behaviour exhibited by both P1 and P2. When
composing, the participants repeatedly directed their gaze
between the tutorial and the workspace. When asked about
this during the interview phase, both participants indepen-
dently agreed that this was not problematic.

Table 1: The findings for each iteration alongside the consequent design implications. 
Iteration Findings Design Implications 
1 (Pilot) 
The note lengths shown on the pop-up menu were hard to 
differentiate between. 
The pop-up menu size was increased.  
The tutorial was difficult  to read when positioned 
horizontally. 
The position of the tutorial’s viewport was moved to 
a vertical pane. 
2 
The p articipants spent lots of time darting between the 
tutorial and workspace. 
This was queried in the next iteration. 
Terminology was frequently misused. P2 preferred to use 
numeric terminology (such as quarter note or half note). 
The numeric fractions for note values were added to 
the pop-up menu. 
The participants continually disconnected and reconnected 
bars from the starting block, in order to compare different 
notes. 
 
The participant ’s b ody language suggested when they 
were struggling; P1 would frown or shake their head and 
P2 would occasionally purse their lips. 
 
3 
P2 praised the consistent use of mouse-based interactions 
as “you have no idea how much experience a kid will have 
[typing]”. 
 
The participants praised the ad dition of fractional values 
to the pop -up menu . Notably,  P1 suggested that the 
fractions could push stronger children “if they did not 
already know about these”. 
 
The participants found it difficult to distinguish between 
tempo-related blocks.  
One of these blocks was distinctly coloured orange. 
P1 praised the “little symbol” on the block that controls the 
global project tempo, suggesting  it helps to denote the 
block’s purpose.  
All of the instrument blocks implemented in the next 
iteration were given a “little symbol”. 
The participants still struggled with terminology. An info-bar was developed, displaying extra 
information for each of Codetta’s interactions. 
4 
The info-bar was praised by both participants.  
The colour of blocks helped participants avoid  having to 
use precise, specialist terminology. 
 
To change the global project tempo , both participants 
needed to follow a cumbersome sequence of interactions, 
starting with dragging a ‘global tempo’ block into t he 
workspace. 
The ‘global tempo’ block was replaced with a static 
widget in the top right corner of the interface. This  
made it clearer that one object contr olled the entire 
project tempo and minimised the number of clicks 
that were required. 
The participants were happiest when listening back to their 
creations, particularly when exploring different timbres. 
The play button was enlarged and made a brighter 
colour, in order to encourage the participants to use it 
more frequently. 5 
The task set was very challenging.  
The usage of terminology was much stronger in this 
session, with P1 faultlessly referring to time signatures by 
name (four-four, three -four). Codetta’s support for this 
commended was the use of colour, organisation of blocks 
and the info-bar. 
 
P2 often remedied their gaps in knowledge by using t he 
play button to continually confirm the results of  their 
tweaking. P1 also realised similarly that the play button 
was useful for checking music as it is entered. 
 
The participants still had some difficulty in distinguishing 
between the (yellow) tempo-related blocks.  
The global tempo widget and other tempo -related 
blocks were all coloured ‘honeydew’ , so that they  
were distinct, but also clearly related. 
The introduction of clefs was the most confusing concept 
so far.  
 
The global tempo widget was praised by P1 and P2.

Figure 4: The third iteration’s “little globe symbol”
(top - see Table 1), design changes for the time-
related blocks (middle) and info-bar (bottom).
Furthermore, the tutorial engaged the participants in
exploring time (tempo) in music. The ﬁnal task set was
to recreate Steve Reich’s Piano Phase as its simple process
yields impressive results with minimal eﬀort, providing mo-
tivation to early-stage learners [15]. Even without a prior
understanding of time-signatures or metre, the participants
were able to understand and practically apply such concepts
by tinkering with Codetta’s tempo-related blocks. However,
the participants found it hard to distinguish between the
diﬀerent time-related blocks. Thus, one block was distinctly
coloured orange (from yellow) (see Figure 4).
As alluded to in the previous iteration, using terminology
was a struggle for P1 and P2 throughout the process also.
Thus, an info-bar was added to the bottom of Codetta,
adding extra information to all interactions (see Figure 4).
4.3 Fourth & Fifth Iteration
Figure 5: The fourth iteration’s design changes for
both the playback and tempo controls (described in
Table 1).
For the fourth iteration, focus was placed on understand-
ing which elements of the interface the participants found
most engaging, whilst the tutorial focused on dynamic con-
trasts and diﬀerent timbres. The previous iterations had
focused on time and pitch, so timbre was an unexplored
dimension of music. It was found that the participants
were happiest when hearing their creations, particularly
when exploring diﬀerent timbres. P1 asked to try out more
instruments during the interview, and P2 exclaimed “Woah,
we have diﬀerent instruments now! That is so cool!” when
ﬁrst discovering the feature.
Figure 6: The ﬁfth iteration’s design changes for
the tempo blocks and info-bar.
In the ﬁfth iteration, the goal was to re-assess the par-
ticipant’s comfort with specialist terms. Both bass and tre-
ble clefs were also introduced in the tutorial, however, were
challenging for the participants to understand. It is possible
that such a concept is too disengaged from current child-
friendly pedagogies and more related to traditional music
theory. To remedy this, the info-bar was updated to dis-
play a recommended clef (see Figure 6). Furthermore, there
was still some confusion in distinguishing between the dif-
ferent time-related blocks; the colour of the tempo-related
UI features were consequently matched (see Figure 6).
5. DISCUSSION & FUTURE WORK
This paper contributes an iterative design method that was
used to develop Codetta: a block-based music system to
support children in composition. The devised method
triangulated the think-aloud protocol with DA and inter-
views, yielding useful design recommendations for educa-
tional musical interfaces via ‘proxy’ users. This was achieved
without obtruding on educator’s already challenging work-
loads, or undergoing a lengthy ethical review process.
The think-aloud protocol successfully produced rich and
detailed descriptive results, capturing both the participant’s
interactions and aﬀective responses whilst using Codetta.
Notably, facial expressions provided useful non-verbal clues
that would not have been captured by other methods (such
as data logging).
However, the iterative design method placed a large bur-
den on the researcher who had to not only transcribe and
analyse each think-aloud recording, but also develop the
software and accompanying tutorials within a single
iteration. This would be challenging to maintain over a
longer period, or with a larger number of participants.
Alternatively, each task could be spread across several re-
searchers and/or accelerated using data analysis software.
Furthermore, a lightweight alternative to the analytically
heavy DA technique may elicit just as useful results. The-
matic analysis (as in [3]), for example, is a faster and easier
to understand alternative, which has been successfully used
by researchers intersecting interaction design and music [5].
Although the ‘proxy’ design method avoids many of the
challenges present in CCI research, it does not encompass
the opinions of actual children, nor practising educators.
It is recommended that the method is applied in tandem
with other evaluative studies, in order to ensure the end-
user is still heavily involved in the development process.
Indeed, ongoing work with Codetta aims to evaluate its
real-world use in the classroom. The results of such work
aim to not just understand Codetta’s ability to support
child interaction in digital composition, but also validate the

eﬀectiveness of the iterative method presented here.
A further weakness of this work is that the proposed
iterative design process was applied to an already function-
ing base of a LOGO-inspired composition tool. Inevitably,
the researchers own background and opinions would have
(albeit passively) informed this design. Researchers adopt-
ing this method should bear this in mind and strive to be
as reﬂexive as possible. Moreover, directly applying this
method to the assumption that LOGO systems are a good
ﬁt for music education would strengthen this work.
Overall, the proposed method provides an eﬀective solu-
tion to developing software for child users, whilst avoiding
many of the barriers slowing the process of conducting re-
search involving children. If we want to nurture childrens’
creativity, why not ensure that, as developers/researchers,
we can use multiple eﬃcient techniques, in order to provide
children with the best creative tools?
