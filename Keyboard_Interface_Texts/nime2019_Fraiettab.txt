ABSTRACT
This paper presents the use of Stellarium planetarium soft-
ware coupled with the VizieR database of astronomical cat-
alogues as an interface mechanism for creating astronomy
based multimedia performances, and as a music composi-
tion interface. The celestial display from Stellarium is used
to query VizieR, which then obtains scientiﬁc astronomi-
cal data from the stars displayed–including colour, celes-
tial position, magnitude and distance–and sends it as input
data for music composition or performance. Stellarium and
VizieR are controlled through Stellar Command, a software
library that couples the two systems and can be used as
both a standalone command line utility using Open Sound
Control, and as a software library.

1. INTRODUCTION
Musical composition and performance inspired or based on
astronomy has been used in many cultures for millennia,
with many civilizations creating songs and dances based
on the astronomical calendar to reinforce the tracking of
seasonal activities; such as planting and harvesting of crops,
times of trade, and religious or cultural practices [33, 8, 25].
More recently, composers have used scientiﬁc data obtained
from individual stars to generate sounds and have created
compositions directly correlated to that data [14, 7].
The advancement of computing power has made the avail-
ability of planetarium software for both desktop and mobile
platforms very accessible to many people. These software
packages are not only used for scientiﬁc and research activ-
ities; such as astronomy, education and general stargazing;
they have also been used by artists in presenting multimedia
artworks and installations [39, 35].
This paper will introduce Stellar Command , a software
system that integratesStellarium planetarium software with

online astronomical data acquisition throughVizieR database
of astronomical catalogues [30]. Stellar Command can be
used as an interface mechanism for correlating music and
sound generation, allowing Stellarium to be used as both a
direct input interface for performance or composition, and
as a remotely controlled derivative multimedia display out-
put.
2. RELATED WORK
Many composers have used the cosmos as inspiration or
stimulus to their works, with many using scientiﬁc obser-
vations or data as input [18, 14]. The Quadrivium linked
astronomy, mathematics, geometry and music as a stan-
dard part of classical education up until the renaissance
[26]. Composers have been mapping mathematics and ge-
ometry to music since antiquity [20, 5]. Kepler stated “The
heavenly motions are nothing but a continuous song for sev-
eral voices, to be perceived by the intellect, not by the ear; a
music which, through discordant tensions, through syncopa-
tions and cadenzas as it were, progresses toward certain pre
designed six-voiced cadences, and thereby sets landmarks in
the immeasurable ﬂow of time.” [32, cited in 286]. This no-
tion inspired Rogers and Ruﬀ to compose The Harmony of
the World (1979), describing their work as “A Realization
for the Ear” [32, p. 286] of Johannes Kepler’s Astronomical
Data from Harmonices Mundi 1619. More recently, com-
posers have used measurements from online databases as
inputs to automata or as stimulus to performers.
Nick Ryan developed a musical instrument called Ma-
chine 9 that uses the location of 27,000 pieces of space junk
as input to an automaton [19]. The instrument is a large
cylindrical phonograph that maps space debris to sound as
it directly passes overhead. Each groove on the cylinder is
associated with a catalogued piece of space debris [1]. The
system accesses publicly available databases that provides
the telemetry data of space debris, which is then modelled
in real-time. When the telemetry data indicates that one
of catalogued items is overhead, the machine locates one
of the grooves on the cylinder and plays a mapped sound
mechanically through a record-player type stylus.
Another system based on astronomical catalogues was the
author’s own musical composition and performance inter-
face using naked eye and binocular astronomy [14]. A spe-
ciﬁc star was determined by calculating its azimuth and
height above the horizon–known as its altitude–using ac-
celerometer and magnetometer sensors, and calculating the
exact location of the star on the celestial sphere using the
sensor data, time and geographical location of the observer.
This calculation returns the star’s right ascension (RA) ,
which is based on its azimuth at Greenwich Meantime at
the vernal equinox, and its declination (Dec.), which is the
stars north-south position at the same time [10, 14]. The
resultant RA and Dec. are added as input to the VizieR
387
database of online catalogues, returning data about stars–
such as brightness and colour–within the deﬁned radius.
Various works were created using this interface. In one
performance, which was conducted in conjunction with the
Newcastle Astronomical Society on one of their ﬁeld view-
ing nights, members of the public were enticed into viewing
the night sky through high powered binoculars, while the
sound generated, which was based on data from the stars
they were viewing, was played through loudspeakers on the
ﬁeld [13]. Another set of performances was conducted with
an improvising ensemble that featured various astronomi-
cal photos displayed as a slide show where the astronomical
data was mapped as MIDI and functioned as inspirational
impetus for the performers [7].
Although both systems are innovative and impressive,
they have identiﬁable boundaries. First, Machine 9 exists
as an installation piece using unique piece of specialised
hardware [1]. Furthermore, a publicly available API to con-
vert the space debris to a musical transmission protocol like
MIDI or OSC [37] is not yet available for the wider com-
puter music community. Secondly, although the binocular
display has an awesome display–the actual night sky–“few
people ventured outside to the astronomical equipment”[14,
p. 50] because they were required to leave the room to look
through binoculars while the ensemble played in a room.
Furthermore, the work is severely bound by weather condi-
tions and a clear view of the sky. In one of the performances,
“the sky was completely covered with cloud and it rained,
so there was nothing to see through the binoculars. The
audience, however, enjoyed the ensemble performance with
the NASA image slide show with samples fed from stored
star tables.”[14, p. 50]. This weather constraint inspired
the author to use planetarium software as the input and
display mechanism as an alternative to binoculars.
Stellar Command enables composers to access astronom-
ical data as input to their software using a common API.
It also enables them to provide the audience an impressive
planetarium software display that runs on a laptop com-
puter without requiring the audience to leave the room.
Furthermore, it facilitates creation of interactive celestial
based installations. Stellar Command is available as open
source software through GitHub [16].
2.1 Stellarium
Stellarium is a software program designed to enable people
to create a virtual planetarium using their home computer
[40]. It runs on Windows, OSX and Linux/Unix, including
Raspberry Pi [40, p. 6]. Stellarium calculates positions of
the Sun, moon, stars and planets based on the time and
location deﬁned by the user, and renders them to the dis-
play. Stellarium is used by both amateur and professional
astronomers, and is used by the European Organisation for
Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere to fa-
cilitate distribution and sharing of visual data among sci-
entists [6]. Stellarium has a very high quality graphical
display, supporting spherical mirror projection that can be
used with a dome [27] and is used in many schools and
museums because it is both scientiﬁcally accurate and visu-
ally engaging [6]. Moreover, Stellarium can display con-
stellations from several diﬀerent cultures and has labels
translated to more than 40 languages, making Stellarium
both culturally aware and inclusive [6]. For example, Fig-
ures 1 and 2 display the same area of sky, however the ﬁrst
presents the constellations using the western sky lore while
the latter presents them in the Tukano sky lore 1 [31]. A

western region of Brazil [21].
comparison reveals that Scorpius and Crux are referred to
as the Fer-de-lance and the Tortoise. This feature can make
Stellarium an extremely useful tool in facilitating multime-
dia presentations for ethnomusicogy or composing in non-
western contexts.
Figure 1: Constellations displayed in Western sky
lore.
Figure 2: Constellations displayed in Tukano sky
lore.
Many astronomers use Stellarium to display a prediction
of the sky for a future time, such as organising a view-
ing night or planning an astro-photography session [4]. Ar-
chaeoastronomers also use the feature to generate an astro-
nomical display from a location for a period sometime in
the past [38]. Also, the landscape feature facilitates a con-
nection between landscape and skyscape, so one can map
the sky against a landscape for research or aesthetics [39].
Stellarium scripts are written in ECMAScript, also known
as Javascript, and enables the programmer to generate and
run an automated astronomy presentation, facilitating au-
tomation of all the functionality of Stellarium [40].
Stellarium has a Remote Control plugin that enables third
party programs to communicate with Stellarium via a REST
client. This feature was used by the author to create an in-
teractive spacecraft game using a sonic ball as a preliminary
test of Stellarium’s viability as a responsive performance
interface [17]. The plugin also allows clients to query the
status of Stellarium, including the area of sky currently be-
ing displayed. The exact celestial vector and ﬁeld of view
displayed are used as the input to the VizieR server in order
to obtain data about stars in that location.
2.2 VizieR
388
VizieR is an online database of high quality astronomical
catalogues collected by the Centre de Donn´ ees astronomiques
de Strasbourg (CDS), one of whose main goals “is to pro-
mote the usage of the reliable astronomical catalogues to
the astronomical community” [30, p. 25]. One of the ways
CDS ensures the reliability of their archives and catalogues
is to only collect data that has been published or accepted in
refereed scientiﬁc journals or literature. The number of cat-
alogues available has grown from 3000 in 1999 [30, p. 24] to
currently 18000 [3]. Catalogues can be selected by name or
based on the wavelength, mission and astronomy type [29].
Wavelength dictates the frequency spectrum of the data in
the catalogue, such as radio, infra-red, optical, x-ray, and
Gamma-RAY. The mission indicates the purpose for which
the catalogue was created or is used. For example, the pur-
pose of the Kepler Mission is to“detect Earth-size planets in
the habitable zone ... of solar-like stars... , determine their
frequency, and identify their characteristics.” [22, p. 2]; and
so catalogues created or used within this mission can be
speciﬁcally targeted. The type of astronomy indicates the
subject area of research that the catalogue belongs to; for
example, black holes, galaxy clusters, planetary nebulae,
red shifts, and photometry.
Once a user has selected the database criteria to search,
they must provide VizieR a search window that consists of
a target centre and area around that point to search. The
target centre is the point on the celestial sphere referenced
to a celestial equinox2, and can be deﬁned by object name,
RA and Dec., or by IAU-coordinates [2].
3. STELLAR COMMAND MODULE
Although it is possible to communicate directly to Stellar-
ium and VizieR directly through the HTTP interface, the
stellar position parameters between the two systems are dif-
ferent. Stellarium returns its position information as three
dimensional spherical points, with a separate query for the
ﬁeld of view; whereas, VizieR requires the data as a two
dimensional geometric point with a deﬁned radius. The
Stellar Command module abstracts this information from
the client software and removes the requirement to perform
these calculations by the client. Stellar Command directs
VizieR to query the Hipparcos catalogue because it provides
a “complete all-sky survey of astrometric and photometric
parameters for one million stars down to magnitude 11 ”
[36, p. 201]. An attempt was made using other photomet-
ric catalogues, however, it was diﬃcult to obtain consistent
results for all sky locations.
In order to simplify interfacing the two systems, querying
of the Stellarium and VizieR systems were separated into
separate modules. In addition to reducing coupling between
them, resulting in more robust code [23], the modules could
also be used independently for astronomical applications.
In addressing the diﬀerent target communities—artistic and
scientiﬁc–the code would be expected to run on multiple
operating systems, including Windows, OSX, and Linux.
Moreover, it was preferable to have a single executable ver-
sion of the software rather than having to conﬁgure and
build a separate program for each diﬀerent platform.
The interface required to control both Stellarium and
VizieR was HTTP based, so a language that provided net-
work functionality as a fundamental core feature was pre-
ferred. Also, it was imperative that third party users of
the library should not have to learn a particular program-
ming language, but instead, could easily interface with the
library using their preferred music package such as Max
MSP, SuperCollider or PD. Furthermore, it would be ad-

vantageous for users to be able to integrate the library into
the programming language of their choice, such as C, C++,
Python, Ruby, or Java.
Developing the system as a Java Archive (JAR) fulﬁlled
all these requirements. Using a JAR ﬁle allowed instantia-
tion from the command line, running as separate processes
and using OSC to communicate with other programs. Ad-
ditionally, many other programming languages can connect
directly to a JAR through the Java Native Interface (JNI)
[24].
3.1 Launching Stellar Command Module
The Stellar Command system, displayed in Figure 3, shows
how the diﬀerent systems interact with the Stellar Com-
mand module and with one another.
Figure 3: Stellar Command Use Case.
A performer is able to either control Stellarium directly,
for example using Stellarium’s keyboard commands or a
third party Remote Control client, or through the Stellar
Command module via an OSC or JNI client 3.
The Stellar Command module is instantiated by execut-
ing Java with the name of the JAR ﬁle and the required
program arguments that deﬁne communication, such as the
network port to send OSC messages to, and the OSC ad-
dress space. For example, to start the StellarCommand
module so it sends OSC messages on UDP port 1234 using
an OSC address space of /Stellar,4 one would execute the
following command:
java -jar StellarCommand.jar port=1234 \
osc=/Stellar.
When the server starts, it will open the ﬁrst available
UDP port, and notify the client of this port. For exam-
ple, if the command module opened port 4567, it will send
an OSC message /Stellar/osc 4567 to the client on the
localhost. Allowing the command module to ﬁnd its own
port number removes the probability of port clashes as each
client furnishes the other with a valid port number for com-
municating without requiring conﬁguration in the command
module. It is, however, possible to request the Stellar Com-

programming language and is outside the scope of this pa-
per.

same computer.

mand module try certain ports by adding the argument try-
port with a comma separated list of ports. For example,
the argument tryport=3333,4444,5555 will cause Stellar-
ium to sequentially try opening the ports listed, and if these
all fail, will then open the ﬁrst available port.
The OSC client and the Stellarium server do not have to
be on the same physical computer as the Stellar Command
module. For example Figure 4, shows three OSC clients
and a Stellarium server on a LAN, and a remote Stellarium
server accessible from the internet through myserver.com.
Figure 4: Remote Stellarium and OSC Clients.
Creating a connection between OSC Client 1 and Remote
Stellarium Server is eﬀected by adding adding the argu-
ments
client=192.168.0.5 and stellarium=http://myserver.com
to the command line. This will cause the Stellar Command
module to send OSC messages to “192.168.0.5” and Stellar-
ium commands to http://myserver.com on HTP port 80905,
eﬀectively acting as a proxy between the two. A typical se-
quence of events is shown in Figure 5.

mand module open its ﬁrst available port and notiﬁes the

OSC Client of this port so it knows which port to send OSC
to. 3). The OSC client sends a message to Stellar Command
to eﬀect a position or display change in Stellarium. 4). Stel-
lar Command decodes the message and sends an encoded
HTTP message to Stellarium. 5). Stellar Command then
sends a query to Stellarium to receive information about
position state. 6). Stellar Command queries VizieR and
obtains data about the stars displayed. 7). Stellar Com-
mand packs and sends the data to the OSC Client.
It is possible to instantiate multiple instances of the com-
mand module with diﬀerent program arguments, so one
could eﬀectively control any number of systems running
Stellarium on any number of computers, interfacing with
any number of OSC clients.
It is simple to create sudo conﬁguration ﬁles by creating
shell scripts for OSX and Linux or a batch ﬁle for Windows
with predeﬁned program arguments. For example, execut-
ing the following in a shell script will run the command
module with the port and OSC address deﬁned in variables
PORT and OSC:
#!/bin/bash
PORT="1234"
OSC="/Stellar"
java -jar StellarCommand.jar port=$PORT osc=$OSC
3.2 Decoding Stellar Parameters
The data received from Stellar Command by the client con-
tains all the data for the ﬁeld of view as a single event.
When using an OSC client, the messages are packed into
a bundle, with the column names in the ﬁrst OSC packet
with an address space of names while the data uses an ad-
dress space of value is used for the actual data values. For
example, if Stellarium was displaying 0.9 degrees at ACrux,
the data returned from the VizieR catalogue would approx-
imately be that shown in Table 1 6, the bundled packets
would be transmitted as below.
/Stellar/names RArad DErad Hpmag B-V
/Stellar/value 184.9737 -62.8541 6.8854 0.248
/Stellar/value 185.9260 -63.8700 7.4616 0.146
/Stellar/value 186.6497 -63.0990 0.6739 -0.243
/Stellar/value 186.8535 -63.7889 6.0467 0.052
The data in Table 1 represents less than a one degree ﬁeld
of view, whereas the skyscape shown in Figure 1 displays
a fourteen degree ﬁeld of view, which would return over
3000 stars. Although a user could ﬁlter these in the client
application, parsing and decoding an OSC bundle message
containing more than 3000 OSC packets would use a sig-
niﬁcant amount of resources. It is possible to reduce the
number of messages received by applying a ﬁlter inside the
Stellar Command module. For example, to retrieve data
about stars brighter than magnitude 6, one would send the
following OSC message to Stellar Command: 7
/Stellar/filter/Hpmagr/less 6
6RArad is Right Ascension, DErad is Declination, Hpmag
is Hipparcos magnitude and B-V is Colour index
7Brighter stars have lower magnitude values.
390
After receiving the command, Stellar Command will apply
the ﬁlter to all messages until the ﬁlter is reset. Also, the
server can be conﬁgured to only send a notiﬁcation that new
bundle of stars being available instead of sending thousands
of OSC messages every second.
It is possible to save VizieR tables to a ﬁle and access
them later. The advantage of this is twofold. First, the sys-
tem can be used when little or no Internet access is available.
Secondly, accessing the data from a ﬁle signiﬁcantly reduces
latency when used in a choreographed work.
4. COMPOSITIONAL EXAMPLE
When considering a method to demonstrate mapping astro-
nomical data with music, the challenge was to compose a
work that not only demonstrated the possibilities and ca-
pabilities of Stellar Command as a composition and perfor-
mance interface, but to compose a work whose subject cel-
ebrated the conference theme and location. The Brazilian
national ﬂag, shown in Figure 6, was chosen as the subject
because the author was not only able to blend art, science
and politics into a multimedia performance; the ﬂag also de-
picts a hidden astronomical event at a ﬁxed point in Brazil’s
history that can be veriﬁed and analysed in detail using
Stellarium.8 The ﬂag displays twenty-seven stars from nine
constellations as they would have appeared above the sky
of Rio de Janeiro at 8:30 a.m. on November 15, 1889, with
each star representing a diﬀerent state [9]. The audience is
taken for a cosmic tour of Brazil in that they are escorted
across the sky from one star on the ﬂag to the next, while
being presented scientiﬁc data, the state represented by the
star, and music that has been created from star data re-
trieved from the VizieR catalogues that have been mapped
to musical parameters. The idea of this work was inﬂuenced
by the author’s proposed musical tour of the Southern Cross
[14].
Figure 6: Flag of Brazil
The primary method of audio generation was through
the use of the HappyBrackets creative coding toolkit, which
facilitated granular synthesis of samples from recordings of
indigenous Indians of Brazil, complex digital signal process-
ing, and eﬀective quantisation of azimuth values to rhyth-
mic timing and altitude to pitches modes. The star colour
and magnitude were mapped to grain width and note du-
ration respectively. Communication between Stellar Com-
mand and HappyBrackets was eﬀected by directly interfac-
ing the Java library to the Java algorithmic composition

software, which in turn reduced ineﬃciencies inherent of
OSC decoding [28, 12, 11, 34]. Sending the data via OSC
would require allocation and decoding of the string param-
eters in memory, coupled with communication through the
localhost, whereas, using the Java event directly allowed the
system to pass the data structure by reference, signiﬁcantly
reducing valuable system resources. The complete details
of the composition and mapping strategies are too detailed
to be included in this paper and are presented in a separate
paper in these conference proceedings [15].
5. FUTURE WORK
Although the system is eﬀective for obtaining astronomical
data based on Stellarium’s display, it is bound in that it
requires Internet access to VizieR between composition and
performance. If for example, a composer wanted to create
a new work and they were in a remote location with no
Internet access, then they would be unable to continue. The
system could be improved by accessing the database used
by the actual Stellarium program. Moreover, this research
could be used to provide mapping and soniﬁcation of stellar
information in the Stellarium program in a future release.
6. CONCLUSIONS
This paper detailed a mechanism for correlating a display
from the Stellarium planetarium software and scientiﬁc data
from the Hipparcos astronomical database through the VizieR
database of astronomical catalogues. Furthermore, it pre-
sented the Stellar Command software package, which facil-
itates the correlation of the two systems into both a library
that can be called directly within other software programs,
and as a separate process that communicates through OSC.
The system is able to connect with multiple instances of
Stellarium on both local area networks, and remote net-
works through the Internet.
Finally, a brief description of how Stellar Command was
used to implement a multimedia composition based on the
Flag of Brazil.
