ABSTRACT
Based on the experience garnered through a longitudinal
ethnographic study, the authors reﬂect on the practice of
designing and fabricating bespoke, accessible music tech-
nologies. Of particular focus are the social, technical and
environmental factors at play which make the provision of
such technology a reality. The authors make suggestions of
ways to achieve long-term, sustained use. Seemingly those
involved in its design, fabrication and use could beneﬁt from
a concerted eﬀort to share resources, knowledge and skill as
a mobilised community of practitioners.

1. INTRODUCTION
The commercial music technology sector is rife with tools to
assist users in their creative pursuits. For instance, machine
learning algorithms assisting remix artists in music source
separation [8], or FFT analysis combined with gamiﬁca-
tion techniques, assisting musicians in learning their instru-
ments1. Some people face disabling barriers in musicking,
i.e. participation, in any capacity, in musical performance or
composition [18]. Access barriers can be overcome through
the use of commercial Accessible Music Technology (AMT)
devices, such as Soundbeam2. As disability is often unique
to an individual, bespoke technological solutions hold grea t
potential to address speciﬁc needs.
In order for technology to be successful in removing access
barriers, certain social, technical and environmental factors
need to be considered. Unfortunately, it is often the case
that bespoke AMT does not see sustained use [17]. Device

longevity is also problematic for new digital musical instru-
ments (DMIs) [10] and assistive technologies; studies have
found that users abandon up to 50% of assistive technologies
within ﬁve years [13]. The authors’ underlying assumption
is that factors contributing toward the short life-span of
these two types of technology are likely to be compounded
for bespoke AMT.
The Drake Music Project Northern Ireland (DMNI) is one
of several third-sector inclusive music organisations that us e
music technology to provide disabled people with access to
musicking. Other prominent organisations include Share
Music & Performing Arts3, Heart n Soul 4 and the OHMI
Trust5. The primary author of this paper spent two years
working as an Access Music Tutor with DMNI, developing
bespoke AMT. Based on his experience this paper explores
key factors aﬀecting the adoption and longevity of bespoke
AMT and suggests ways in which to achieve sustained use.
2. TERMINOLOGY
The termAssistive Technology describes technology, de-
signed to assist disabled people in various aspects of their
daily life. Screen reading software or computer access switches
are examples of assistive technology. Some prefer the term
Accessible Technology, arguing that all technology can be
said to assist its users to some extent [9].
Accessible Digital Musical Instruments(ADMIs), rather
than Assistive Digital Musical Instruments, is a term that
is gaining popularity, especially within the NIME commu-
nity. A shortcoming of this term is the omission of accessible
or enabling technological tools, used for musical purposes,
which are not necessarily musical instruments in their own
right. The Haptic Wave [19] is an example of such technol-
ogy, designed for audio engineers with visual impairments;
it provides a physical representation of audio waveform am-
plitude. Another example is Device One6, a USB MIDI
switch interface, pictured in Figure 1. Developed in a col-
laboration between DMNI and the primary author, it allows
control of music software by computer access switches. To
include technology of this kind, the authors have opted for
the termAccessible Music Technology(AMT). Furthermore,
as such technology could be operated by a musician, com-
poser or engineer the termartist is used to encompass all
three.
Do-It-Yourself Assistive Technology(DIY-AT), is a term
used to describe bespoke, accessible technologies. Often, th e
development of DIY-AT is done on behalf of the intended
user, making it a misleading term. Past research has oﬀered
DIY-for-othersas an alternative [12]. However, in being

somewhat of a misnomer, the authors have instead opted
for the termbespoke AMT.
3. ACCESS BARRIERS TO MUSICKING
The Social Model of Disability [21] describes disability as
a condition that arises through the organisation of society,
the attitudes it holds and the design of the environment in
which it exists. A person is disabled by factors external to
them, not by any particular impairment. A typical exam-
ple of this phenomenon is a wheelchair user, disabled from
entry to a public building through the omission of a mobil-
ity ramp. In this scenario, we can say that the person in
question faces anaccess barrier. There are many potential
access barriers to musicking, dependent on the speciﬁc task
or activity the artist is aiming to achieve and the nature of
their impairment. The complexities of overcoming access
barriers become clear when examining speciﬁc examples.
3.1 The Piano and The Wheelchair
In the context of musical performance. there is a require-
ment for musicians to have precise motor control. The piano
in a traditional setting is a useful example. Disregarding its
extraordinary inner workings, one might argue that the key-
boardinterface is conceptually simplistic, a series of keys
each producing a diﬀerent pitch when pressed. Early in-
teractions with a piano involve the novice player becoming
proﬁcient in targeting speciﬁc keys with speciﬁc ﬁngers of
one hand. Before long a second hand is introduced. The
player is soon using several ﬁngers to press several diﬀerent
keys simultaneously and rhythmically. The keyboard inter-
face demands a set of aﬀordances which may not be avail-
able to individuals with physical impairments, for example,
Cerebral Palsy, a life-long condition aﬀecting movement and
coordination [11].
The physical characteristics of the acoustic piano place
requirements on the player. The keyboard mechanism is
at a ﬁxed height; it cannot move higher or lower. Con-
vention dictates the player be seated on a speciﬁcally de-
signed stool. Their knees must be beneath the keyboard
mechanism, feet in reach of the pedals and arms extended
forward with ﬁngers resting on the keys. Figure 2 depicts
the average dimensions of an adult seated in a wheelchair
[7] alongside the approximate dimensions of a Yamaha U3
acoustic piano. On average a wheelchair armrest is 78cm
from the ﬂoor. The top of the U3 keys are 73.5cm from the
ﬂoor; this may hinder the wheelchair user from getting suit-
ably close to the piano keys. The comfortable reach of an
adult wheelchair user is approximately 18cm [6]. Although
somewhat of a generalisation, these factors could result in a
wheelchair user playing the piano in an uncomfortable posi-
tion or prohibit them from playing the instrument entirely.
Figure 2: Typical Dimensions of an Adult
Wheelchair User Alongside Dimensions of a
Yamaha U3 Acoustic Piano.
How does an individual, with interest in playing and learn-
ing a musical instrument, overcome disabling barriers such
as the ﬁxed dimensions of an acoustic piano? Part of the
disabling barrier in the above example lay in the design
of the instrument and wheelchair technologies. These de-
signs combined are imposing requirements on the musician.
Therefore, theoretically, the barrier itself can be partially
lifted through design. However, the critical challenge in
overcoming access barriers lies not solely in conceptual de-
sign, but in its realisation, and application in a real-world
context.
4. AMT LONGEVITY IN
NORTHERN IRELAND
The majority of bespoke AMTs developed by DMNI are a
result of short-term collaborative projects, such as hackathons,
involving disabled artists, Access Music Tutors and mak-
ers. In 2015, the ﬁrst of these events saw music technology
students from Queen’s University Belfast partnered with
DMNI artists [16]. Over three days, each pair collabora-
tively designed and fabricated bespoke AMT tailored to-
ward the music access requirements of the artist. Disabled
artist Mary-Louise McCord co-designed a gestural instru-
ment. Hand movements were captured and translated to
sound using custom software and hardware.
Due to the success of the hackathon, organisers planned
a second event the following year. Recognising the creative
potential of the bespoke AMT she co-designed a year prior,
Mary-Lousie decided that she would like to continue work-
ing on it. Unfortunately, this bespoke AMT no longer ex-
isted. The hardware had been dissembled and the software
lost. To develop the concept further, Mary-Lousie would
need to start from scratch. It seems like a waste of precious
time and resources to be required to reinvent the wheel.
Unfortunately, there is a shortage of longitudinal studies
into the broader use of bespoke AMTs [5]. As both Assis-
tive Technology and new DMIs face issues with longevity
[13] [10], our assumption is the short life-span of bespoke
AMT is likely a pervasive issue, aﬀecting inclusive music
organisations more widely.
To help better understand factors which contribute to-
ward the sustained use of bespoke AMTs, the authors de-
signed an ethnographic study. In similar fashion to past
hackathons, a DMNI artist would co-design a bespoke AMT.
In this instance the study would take place over six months,
providing an opportunity to monitor longer-term use of be-
spoke AMT. The study was divided into three stages, as
listed below, each stage two months in duration. The study
commenced in the Autumn of 2018.

tored.

4.1 Participatory Design
The Human Activity Assistive Technology model (HAAT),
is an approach credited with reducing the likelihood of aban-
donment due to poor design [1]. Prudence led to the appli-
cation of this model to the ethnographic study. The HAAT
model dictates that for accessible technology to be eﬀective,
we must consider the following four interconnected facets:
1. Human: What are the goals, skills and abilities of
the artist?
2. Activity: What is the nature of the planned activity?
3. Technology: What features does it have, and how
does one interact with it?
4. Context: What are the physical, social and cultural
attributes of the environment in which the three ele-
ments above exist?
Stage 1 of the study was pivotal in providing the primary
author with a robust understanding of all four areas. It is
essential to note an early lesson at this point. It can take
time to understand the subtleties of access barriers. Stage
1 of the study did not take two months as initially planned,
it took closer to six. Below we share the critical ﬁndings of
this process. The interconnected nature of the four facets
of the HAAT model becomes evident when attempting to
describe each in isolation.
4.1.1 The Human - The Artist
The disabled artist invited to participate in this study was
Eoin Fitzpatrick, an attendee at weekly DMNI music work-
shops since 2016. Eoin, aged 32, has an eclectic taste in mu-
sic, ranging from classic rock, through to Drum and Bass.
Eoin is a member of Wired Ensemble, an electronic music
outﬁt consisting of four disabled artists. Together, ensem-
ble members share the goals of composing and performing
original electronic music.
Eoin is a physically disabled wheelchair user. As in the
above example, Eoin is disabled from playing traditional
musical instruments. At the beginning of the study, Eoin
was primarily using two gestures for musical interaction,
identiﬁed by DMNI Access Music Tutors and Eoin’s family
through trial and error. The ﬁrst gesture consists of Eoin
moving his left forearm across an approximate range of 45
degrees, from the armrest of his wheelchair, to his chest.
Eoin would brush his left knuckle across the screen of a
face-down iPad, mounted on a microphone stand, control-
ling music Apps such as ThumbJam7. A shortcoming of this
mode of interaction is that Eoin cannot see the graphical
user interface of the Apps he is using. The second gesture
is that of Eoin moving his head from side to side. Eoin’s
comfortable resting position is with his head tilted down,
towards the left. Eoin can move his head from this position
around to the right by approximately 90 degrees. Eoin’s
mother fashioned a seamed cap featuring a frontal pocket
into which an iPhone would sit. Via the App GyroSynth8,
positional data transmitted wirelessly as MIDI messages
would trigger virtual instruments in Ableton Live9.

4.1.2 The Activity
Eoin wanted to play electric rhythm guitar. To help the
authors understand his goals, Eoin participated in initial
design-thinking exercises, for example, the creation of a
mood board. Eoin’s goals were captured inuser stories
and use cases, a typical approach utilised by user experience
designers to guide the design and subsequent development
process. Eoin’s user stories include the two examples below.
“As a musician, I would like to perform with elec-
tric guitar sounds in a live environment. I must
be in control of my instrument when performing,
and it must be comfortable for me to play.”
“As a composer, who works on new material reg-
ularly, I want my instrument to be relevant and
applicable to the music I am composing. I want
the instrument to integrate into my workﬂow.”
4.1.3 The T echnology
Eoin and the authors made an early decision to use digi-
tal technology to recreate the sound of the electric guitar
to reduce cost and potential mechanical complexity. The
authors assumed that Eoin’s left arm and head gestures
would be the best way for Eoin to play his instrument and
therefore explored these ﬁrst. Intertial measurement sensor
(IMU) breakout boards using an InvenSense MPU-605010,
were attached to a headset and wristband worn by Eoin.
The authors discovered that while Eoin can move his head
across a range of 90 degrees, it is diﬃcult for Eoin to keep
his head ﬁxed once he had moved away from his natural
resting position. Furthermore, Eoin demonstrated a ten-
dency to move his head back to its resting position when
moving his arm. Alternative controllers were tested, such as
a sip/puﬀ switch, using an NXP 5500DP pressure sensor11.
As Eoin would typically drink through a straw, sipping came
very naturally to him. Puﬃng was challenging for Eoin; he
would be inclined to puﬀ rapidly, sipping in-between puﬀs.
The authors explored ways of providing Eoin with vi-
sual feedback. An OLED display was attached to the IMU
headset and used to display chord symbols. Research sug-
gests disabled people have lower rates of literacy that non-
disabled people [20]. The authors soon discovered they had
incorrectly assumed that Eoin was literate, making this ap-
proach non-viable.
While there were caveats in the use of the interface ele-
ments described above, it was necessary to the authors to re-
member that given the opportunity, through practise, Eoin
had the potential to acquire new manual skills and knowl-
edge. Over-time, any dedicated musician may develop man-
ual skills as an instrumentalist, and acquire musical knowl-
edge; muscles can strengthen, sight-reading can improve.
The same is true of Eoin, and his bespoke guitar.
The design matured iteratively into a standalone device
with internal speakers that became known as Instrument
One (i1) as shown in ﬁgure 3. Together, Eoin and the pri-
mary author decided not to use an IMU to track head move-
ment. Instead, more accessible to Eoin, was the use of an
oﬀ-the-shelf access switch. Eoin operates the switch with
his chin to select, in a round-robin fashion, one of three pre-
conﬁgured chords. Eoin is given visual feedback to which
chord is selected through the use of multi-coloured LEDs.
The authors found that Eoin can move his right-arm across
a broader range, and is more consistent in its movement in

tual Guitar Instrument
comparison to his left-arm. A wristband on Eoin’s right-
arm transmits positional pitch data, wirelessly to the base
unit of i1, enabling Eoin to pluck the strings of his virtual
guitar. i1 is also capable of playing backing tracks, loaded
via a USB memory stick.
4.1.4 The Context
Eoin was keen to be able to use his instrument not solely
in DMNI music workshops but also at home, allowing him
to practise his instrument and develop as an artist. Eoin’s
dad Peter, a digital immigrant [14], is one of Eoin’s primary
carers. When Eoin uses technology at home, for example
when listening to audio-books via an mp3 player, its use is
facilitated by Peter. The prospect of facilitating the use of
bespoke AMT was daunting for Peter. The authors involved
Peter in the participatory design process to help understand
the carer’s requirements as well.
During DMNI workshops, Access Music Tutor Daniel Todd
facilitates the use of music technology. While Daniel is an
adept music technologist, he does not have experience in
software development or electronics. We needed to build
enough ﬂexibility into the device to ensure that the in-
strument could also meet Daniel’s requirements, without
the need to refactor code. Simultaneously the authors at-
tempted to shield Peter from the relative complexity of the
functions and features Daniel required. Consideration of
the broader context of use resulted in the inclusion of Daniel
and Peter as additionalhumans in the HAAT model. We,
therefore, conducted user experience tests with both Peter
and Daniel to improve usability and created user stories and
use cases to capture their goals and requirements.
4.2 Development
At ﬁrst glance, commercial AMT can seem expensive, per-
haps understandably as niche products cannot beneﬁt from
cost reductions gained through economies of scale. At the
outset of this study, it seemed as though a Raspberry Pi
Zero12, priced at a mere £ 4.50, could provide the function-
ality Eoin, Peter and Daniel required. In reality, techni-
cal design decisions made by the primary author, intended
to expedite the development process, placed additional de-
mands on the hardware. High-level open-source Python li-
braries were adopted to gain access to Bluetooth, Audio
and GPIO functionality. Ultimately a RPi 3 Model A+13,
priced at £ 35 provided enough processing power to use these
libraries simultaneously with acceptable latency. While not
12https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/
raspberry-pi-zero/
13https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/
raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus/
a signiﬁcant increase in itself, this was the beginning of
spiralling costs. To meet use case requirements, oﬀ-the-
shelf breakout boards provided high-quality audio output
and ampliﬁcation. A Teensy LC14 microcontroller board
scanned the user-interface and displayed information on an
Adafruit 1.3” Monochrome OLED screen15.
The IMU breakout board mentioned above proved to be
quite unreliable, producing inconsistent readings. A great
deal of development time was lost troubleshooting. This
breakout board was remarkably cheap; after some consid-
eration, the primary author began to suspect that it was
using a counterfeit sensor. An Adafruit BMO05516 was a
sophisticated, albeit more costly replacement. When cou-
pled with an Adafruit Bluefruit M0 LE17 microcontroller
board, implementation of the wireless wristband was un-
complicated.
The development stage was expedited further by using
an oﬀ-the-shelf access switch plus wheelchair mounts for
the access switch and the base unit of i1. While cost can be
reduced developing such items from scratch, there are time
implications in this approach. The authors were keen not
to rush the development stage of the study as in doing so
there was a danger of accruing unnecessary technical debt
[4]. It took approximately six months to develop i1, four
months longer than initially planned. Ultimately there was
a relationship between ease of development and material
cost, the latter totalling£ 330. As a result of the devel-
opment process the primary author realised that while the
manner in which Eoin interacts with i1 is bespoke, many of
the underlying technologies are not. The breakout boards,
open-source code libraries and new code under-the-hood of
i1 are likely to be useful in other bespoke AMTs.
4.3 Usage
A demonstration, given before hand-over, provided Eoin,
Peter and Daniel with an overview of i1’s features and func-
tionality, providing an opportunity for questions. The au-
thors produced a short manual, covering basic and advanced
operation. As the study progressed, Peter needed further
support to understand certain functions, such as how to play
backing tracks, suggesting some usability issues remained.
Danny demonstrated a higher degree of conﬁdence in the fa-
cilitation of i1. However, he struggled with implementation
quirks such as the ﬁle format and folder hierarchy require-
ments of the USB memory stick, used for backing tracks.
Over time, Peter’s conﬁdence and abilities grew, resulting
in him becoming the expert facilitator in the home envi-
ronment. However, when Peter was not available, Eoin was
not able to use i1; other carers did not have the requisite
knowledge to facilitate its use.
Eoin consistently used i1 at least twice a week at home,
during the majority of weekly DMNI workshops and at one
public-facing performance18. Multi-track recording tech-
niques were used in DMNI workshops to capture solo phrases,
often played over ostinatos or short chord progressions. Eoin
would practise his improvisation techniques at home over
original DMNI recordings. During the two-month period in
which Eoin used the instrument, both the primary author
and Danny noticed improved control in Eoin’s arm and head
movements, albeit anecdotally.

The authors expected to perform maintenance on i1 dur-
ing its use; ﬁxing bugs, hardware faults and adding fea-
tures. And that a failure to perform maintenance would
potentially have a detrimental eﬀect on the life-span of i1.
Interestingly neither Eoin, Peter or Daniel reported or com-
plained of any issues. The primary author recorded one
hardware fault (a loose screw!), and a single software bug
which caused an error in parameter values displayed. Daniel
suggested one feature; being able to adjust the release-time
of the guitar’s amplitude envelope.
Through observation, new use cases occurred to the pri-
mary author. For instance, on some days, Eoin’s arm move-
ments could be more restricted. Providing facilitators with
a way to easily adjust the range of movement required to
trigger the six guitar strings would add useful ﬂexibility. It’s
unclear at this stage if maintenance requests would origi-
nate from Eoin, Peter and Daniel if they were using the
instrument independently without regular contact with the
primary author. Despite the small number of new feature
ideas, due to time constraints, the primary author could
not expand the feature set during this phase of the study.
Altogether Eoin enjoyed using his instrument during these
two months and intends to continue using it in the future.
5. DEPENDENCY MODEL OF ACCESSING
MUSIC THROUGH TECHNOLOGY
Figure 4: The Dependency Model of Accessing
Music Through Technology.
Through the development of Eoin’s instrument, the au-
thors realised that there were dependencies which made ac-
cess to music through technology a reality for Eoin. These
weremonetary and resource, knowledge and skill and time
as depicted in ﬁgure 4. Such dependencies are intercon-
nected. For example, access to ample oﬀ-the-shelf resources
can result in access barriers being lifted quickly for an indi-
vidual. While these three dependencies are somewhat per-
vasive in the development of new music technology, it is
essential to draw attention to them in the context of inclu-
sive music to avoid assumptions being made that as low-cost
maker technology has the potential to remove access barri-
ers, this will naturally happen as a matter of course.
5.1 Monetary and Resource Dependencies
In order to use technology to remove an access barrier, such
a resource needs to be available to the person facing the bar-
rier, or they must have the means to acquire it. Eoin gained
access to bespoke AMT through the case study described
above. It is essential for academics involved in similar stud-
ies to consider how a participant might gain long-term ac-
cess to an enabling device outside the conﬁnes of a study.
Eoin has regular access to commerical AMT through DMNI
workshops. Soundbeam is one of the most prominent com-
mercial AMT devices. At an entry price of£ 250019, Sound-
beam is likely beyond the ﬁnancial means of many disabled
people within the UK [3]. Financial barriers may result in
relatively few disabled people owning AMT, using devices
at home and practising technique, as would a player of a
traditional instrument.
5.2 Knowledge and Skill Dependencies
A degree of specialist knowledge and skill is required to
utilise music technology to remove access barriers. In Eoin’s
case study, knowledge and skill dependencies existed at two
tiers; in the facilitation of music technology, and in its tech-
nical development. Facilitators may not necessarily posses s
the technical knowledge and skill required to develop and
maintain bespoke AMT, but will likely have a strong un-
derstanding of the artists they work with, their goals and
the access barriers they face in musicking. It’s vital for all
stakeholders involved in the use of bespoke AMT to share
knowledge through participation in the design process.
5.3 Time Dependencies
On a practical level it takes time to develop technology; to
write code and design circuits. In addition, it takes time
for the maker to familiarise themselves with the artist and
understand the requirements they might have of bespoke
AMT. To aid facilitators, ease-of-use was of crucial impor-
tance in i1. Tesler’s Law ofThe Conservation of Complexity
states that a degree of complexity is inherent in a process
[15]. Makers need to decide how to distribute complexity
between a user interface and the underlying system, which
can often be a time-consuming aﬀair.
6. COMMUNITY
The Social Model of Disability seeks to avoid a paternalistic
view where disabled people are framed as in need of help and
requiring support from others. The reality of digital tech-
nology use in a broader context is that any user, regardless
of disability, might require support from others. For in-
stance, when faced with a usability issue, or as a result of
experiencing a software bug or hardware fault. Companies
involved in the manufacture of music technology products
and services support their users through dedicated techni-
cal support teams with maintenance tasks factored into the
schedules of engineers. Just like the primary author, inde-
pendent makers may struggle to ﬁnd the time to work on
the maintenance of bespoke AMTs and support their use.
There is one potential solution to this, that of collaborating
with others in such projects.
e-NABLE20 is an online community, totalling some 3300
volunteers, dedicated to the design, fabrication and provi-
sion of low-cost 3D-printed prosthetics. The collaborative
eﬀorts of designers, engineers and occupational therapists
have resulted in sophisticated, standardised designs, capa-
ble of accommodating the needs of individual users through
customisation. The motivations of e-NABLE volunteers in-
clude that of learning new skills coupled with a desire to
have a positive impact on others [12]. The number of e-
NABLE devices distributed to date is approximately 800
[12]. How could a maker be encouraged to contribute toward
the maintenance of a bespoke AMT such as Eoin’s? One
might assume that an individual looking to volunteer their
time to project might be interested in helping the largest
number of people possible in the allotted time, a concept
known as eﬀective altruism [2].

There is an opportunity to standardise and modularise
the common underlying technologies of bespoke AMTs. John
Kellys’ bespoke guitar the Kellycaster21 uses a sophisticated
and comprehensive chord dictionary, which the primary au-
thor plans to implement in i1. Reuse of high-quality modu-
lar technical resources will likely improve the development
ease of bespoke AMTs. Following a modular structure in
hardware, software, and coding procedures can make it eas-
ier to ﬁx, update and expand DMIs [10]. If several people
are using one particular technology, makers may be more in-
clined to contribute their time towards its maintenance. Ini-
tiatives such as Drake Music England’s DMLab22 could play
a vital role in connecting the somewhat disparate makers of
bespoke AMT in a similar way to e-NABLED. Ultimately,
the sharing of resources, knowledge and skill between artists
using bespoke AMT, facilitators and makers will result in
our collective musical landscape becoming richer from the
inclusion all artists regardless of disability.
7. SUMMARY
The authors have described how bespoke AMTs are vital in
enabling disabled artists to gain access to musicking, due to
the unique way in which disability can present itself. There
are dependencies at play which make the successful design,
fabrication and use of such technology a reality. There are
diﬃculties in achieving the sustained use of bespoke AMTs.
The HAAT model can help makers nurture an understand-
ing of the users of bespoke AMTs (i.e. artists, facilitators
and makers), and its environmental context. To achieve the
sustained use of bespoke AMT, the provision of technical
support and ongoing maintenance is required. Rather than
following an industry model ofservice-based support, mak-
ers and those involved in the use of bespoke AMTs will likely
beneﬁt from the formation of a community of practice. Such
a community could work toward common goals through the
sharing of resources, knowledge and skill, forming a partic-
ipatory element of the broader musicking ecology.
