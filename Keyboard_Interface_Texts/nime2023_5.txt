ABSTRACT
Legatus is a three-legged audio and environmentally-reactive
soundscape augmentation artifact created for outdoor ex-
hibitions in locations without access to mains electricity.
Legatus has an approximate ingress protection rating of
IP54, is self-powered, and is easy to transport weighing ap-
proximately a kilogram while fitting within a 185 mm tall
by 110 mm diameter cylinder. With LED-based visual feed-
back and a cochlear loudspeaker-based vocalization system,
Legatus seeks to capture attention and redirect it to the
in-situ sonic environment.
Informed by related historical and contemporary outdoor
sonic installation artworks, we conceptualized and tested
four installation scenarios in 2021. Installations were pre-
sented following a soundscape-specific pop-up exhibition
strategy, where the exhibition venue and artifact placement
are determined by in-situ sonic conditions. Legatus artifacts
use high-level audio features and real-time environmental
conditions including ambient temperature, humidity, and
brightness levels to influence the timing and parameters
of sample playback routines, audio synthesis, and audio
recording.
Having developed and tested for nine months, Legatus
has emerged as a portable, rugged, affordable, adaptable,
lightweight, and simple tool for augmenting natural sonic
environments that can provide last-mile distributions of sonic
installation art experiences to places and communities where
these works are rarely exhibited.

1. INTRODUCTION
Legatus is a continuation of our work exploring the use of
electronic feedback technologies to augment soundscapes in
outdoor natural environments [15, 17]. While prior research
focused on mechatronic and LED-based feedback systems,
for the Legatus project, we develop a general-purpose sound-
scape augmentation artifact using loudspeakers that can be
easily adapted to novel installation scenarios that we cannot
currently realize using our existing systems.
Building on the foundation provided by this prior work,
this paper first examines a variety of music compositions
and sonic art installations produced in natural outdoor lo-
cations. This survey aims to contextualize the design, con-
struction, and exhibition of Legatus by observing successful
components and commonalities between works. Next, the
Legatus hardware, firmware, and physical characteristics
are introduced with a focus on the artifact’s audio record-
ing, playback, and synthesis functionality. This discussion
is followed by the introduction of four unique installation
use cases created to test adaptability to new installation
scenarios. An overview of initial findings and observations
is provided before concluding with examples of future work
facilitated by this research.
2. RELATED WORKS
2.1 Soundscape-Reactive Outdoor Music
Compositions
Creating art is often an exercise of discipline and control,
where the artist manages the development, presentation,
and final form of the artwork. However, within sonic arts
and music composition, there are salient works that em-
brace indeterminacy and stochastic mechanisms either in
their construction or to provide variations when exhibited.
Our research is interested in music compositions and sonic
installation artworks that are exhibited outdoors and which
concede the (typical) advantages granted by indoor venues
including control over the space’s physical size, layout, light-
ing, color, heating, and presence of organisms (e.g. visitor
capacity, absence of wildlife).
With the artistic goal to replace a location’s ambient
background noise to “take over the environment, putting a
new one in its place”, Frederic Rzewski’s Street Music(1968)
demonstrates awareness of the in-situ sonic environment as
the score instructs performers to “regulate the level of your
sound so that it seems to be slightly louder than that of the
sound you hear around you... you are always seeking the
softest sound.”
With a greater focus on supporting and harmonizing ex-
isting sounds, a portion of Pauline Oliveros’s composition
Environmental Dialogue (1974) reads, “as each person be-
comes aware of the field of sounds from the environment,
each person individually and gradually begins to reinforce
the pitch of one of the sound sources that has attracted
their attention” [12]. For Environmental Dialogue, perform-
ers highlight, support, and reinforce environmental sounds
instead of replacing them with new sounds as with Street
Music.
Taking a similar approach as Environmental Dialogue,
David Dunn’s score for PLACE: A Performance in Ten
Parts (1975) includes a segment that instructs a solo vo-
calist to “sustain pitches in response to pitches heard in
the environment. An attempt should be made to trigger
resonances in the environment and reinforce these through
selecting pitches” [6]. While also looking to the in-situ envi-
ronment as a source for performer actions, PLACE: A Per-
formance in Ten Partsadditionally prioritizes the venue’s
acoustic properties by encouraging performers to engage
with environmental echoes and reverberations.
Using environmental reactivity as a means of fostering
awareness of the in-situ environment, these example works
allocate a significant portion of their realizations to the cur-
rent performance venue. Rather than using any specific
notes written on a page, the musicians who realize these
works are influenced by real-time environmental conditions.
Among other artistic objectives, our research aims to take ad-
vantage of the human-driven environmentally-reactive prop-
erties demonstrated in these works in installation scenarios
driven by electronic devices that leverage environmental
sensors and loudspeakers in place of human performers.
2.2 Soundscape Relocation in Outdoor Sonic
Art
Sound art historian Alan Licht uses the termsrelocated sound
and relocated soundscapeto describe a popular strategy used
in sonic installation art where the artist mixes external audio
recordings and audio streams with in-situ sonic environments
to create hybrid listening experiences. Soundscape relocation
is often implemented using an offline strategy by playing back
a soundscape or sound recorded before the exhibit date from
a location different from the exhibition venue. For example,
Richard Serra and Philip Glass’s World Relocation Project
(1969) and Jim Green’s Talking Fence(2010) both used short
audio recordings of spoken words as source material for their
augmentations [10, 1].
Real-time streamed soundscape relocation can be observed
in works such as Benoˆ ıt Maubrey’sCellular Buddies (1996)
which allowed people to record audio for playback by calling
a phone number. Alternatively, Emekah Ogboh’s Lagos
Soundscapes (2008-) features an uninterrupted field recording
from a busy street in Lagos played through loudspeakers
in European cities [2, 11]. Adopting the relocated sounds
to his own artistic objective, Hans Peter Kuhn’s LICHT
(1999) relocates sounds over time but not space by playing
recordings conducted in the installation venue well before the
exhibit and when the space was used for different purposes
[7, 10].
Considering that our high-level research objective is to
design hardware systems that can be reused for several dis-
tinct installation scenarios, technologically supporting sound
relocation greatly increases the flexibility and reusability of
the Legatus platform. Therefore, by supporting this strategy,
there is the potential to reduce future project costs and time
overhead or enable the conceptualization and realization of
greater numbers of installation scenarios. While soundscape
relocation is common within sonic art installations, typically
the cochlear1 focus of these works is the sounds produced by
the artist instead of the in-situ sonic environment. Our re-
search aims to create installation scenarios where the artist’s
cochlear augmentations serve to highlight features of the
in-situ sonic environment and encourage in-situ listening to
sounds not produced by the artist.
2.3 Synthesis in Outdoor Sonic Art
Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, sonic artists have em-
ployed audio synthesis systems to provide real-time cochlear
content in outdoor sonic installation artworks. For example,
Stuart Marshall’s Usk (1969-70) mixes synthetic soundscape
augmentations with the natural world by focusing on Mar-
shall’s cochlear augmentations while ignoring the physical
properties of the sound-producing technology. This approach
is also demonstrated by works such as Max Neuhaus’ Times
Square (1977) which used a hardware-based stochastic gen-
erative synthesis system hidden from view whose sounds are
not directly related to environmental conditions [5].
While the installations Usk and Times Squareused nearly
continuous cochlear augmentations which mix with existing
sonic conditions to create augmented sonic environments,
other artists have incorporated silence into their installa-
tion scenarios to highlight in-situ sonic conditions or actors.
John Cages’s 4’33” (1952) provides a radical example of this
paradigm where the only cochlear content is the opening
and closing of the piano’s key cover and the turning of the
score’s pages [4]. Periods of cochlear inactivity can also
be observed in works such as Annea Lockwood and Bob
Bielecki’s installation Wild Energy (2014) which includes
extended interludes of cochlear inactivity to encourage listen-
ing to the site’s ambient sounds while comfortable outdoor
furniture is provided [10].
Instead of hiding their sound-producing mechanisms from
view, Jon Hassell’s Elemental Warnings segment of the in-
stallation series Landmusic Series“involved 20 miniature
oscillators, which beeped their way into the atmosphere on
helium-filled balloons one day in 1970” [8]. This exhibi-
tion strategy is strikingly similar to the pop-up exhibition
strategy we adopt with Legatus as both are conducted on a
single day and leverage the spatial distribution of several self-
powered, transportable, sound objects according to in-situ
environmental conditions.
Also operating in outdoor natural environments, the artist
Leif Brush created numerous influential works where the
system electronics are prominently featured as a visual com-
ponent of the installation. Brush’s Terrain Instruments
(1968 – 1970s) featured a centralized electronic system wo-
ven into the surrounding landscape using numerous wire-like
1We use the terms cochlear and non-cochlear as developed by
Seth Kim-Cohen in [9] where cochlear refers to the physical
experience of sound waves as they pass through the ear
and are translated into neural impulses, while non-cochlear
refers to the perceptual experience of sound as interpreted by
the brain, which includes cultural, social, and psychological
factors.
sensors wrapped around flora. The physical presence of
the sound-producing electronics as seen in these works by
Hassell and Brush has been observed to promote physical
exploration [8].
These works show synthesized cochlear soundscape aug-
mentation as a time-tested and consistently implemented
method for creating sonic installation artworks. While many
artists choose to hide the physical devices for artistic reasons
including the desire to focus attention on the sounds they are
adding to the environment, some sonic installation artists
including Leif Brush and Hassell prominently feature the
physical and visual qualities of their creations along with
the sounds their devices create.
To ensure Legatus has a high number of artistic and
technological capabilities so future research projects can
use it without requiring substantial hardware, firmware, or
physical changes the platform should support both of these
installation scenarios. Moreover, to support our artistic
motivations, Legatus should appear to be more of a sculpture
than a consumer-available outdoor speaker. Furthermore,
the artifact should maintain a small size and a high-gain
cochlear feedback system that allows it to be hidden from
sight when installation scenarios require it.
3. LEGATUS SOUNDSCAPE AUGMENTA-
TION ARTIFACT
The Legatus project is part of a larger series of outdoor hard-
ware and firmware systems optimized to provide real-time
soundscape augmentation. These artifacts are exhibited with
the common artistic objective to create installation scenarios
that encourage and promote in-situ environmental listening
in outdoor natural locations. Serving as an extension of
our prior work investigating non-cochlear soundscape aug-
mentation with Specul¯ ator [15, 14] and mechatronic-based
augmentation with Explorator [17], Legatus addresses artis-
tic and technological gaps identified in our prior systems by
using loudspeaker-based soundscape augmentations.
Legatus uses the soundscape-specific pop-up exhibition
strategy initially developed with the Specul¯ ator soundscape
augmentation artifact during field expeditions in 2019 [15].
The soundscape-specific pop-up exhibition strategy uses
in-situ sonic conditions to determine exhibition locations
and the specific placement of soundscape augmentation arti-
facts. After soundwalking to determine artifact placement,
installation facilitators document the installation and col-
lect subjective evaluation data to inform future exhibits.
Soundscape-specific pop-up exhibition prioritizes the in-situ
sonic environment over all other environmental or logistical
factors and is realized in short day-long installations that are
intended to expedite the artistic and technological iterative
design process.
3.1 Design Considerations
As Legatus is explicitly created for exhibition in outdoor
natural locations, self-power, robust electronic enclosures,
and transportability are primary design considerations. In
order to increase artifact adaptability and reusability, Lega-
tus needs real-time audio synthesis, audio recording, and
sample playback capabilities, and environmental sensors to
guide behavior. To summarize, the Legatus genus adopts
the following design priorities:
• Self-Power to support exhibition in remote natural
environments for 16 hours on a single charge.
• Transportable so multiple artifacts can be transported
by foot by a single person to installation locations.
• Environmentally reactive hardware and firmware that
can respond to in-situ conditions in real-time.
• Environmentally resistant with an approximate ingress
protection rating of IP54 to protect electronic systems
from exposure to adverse weather conditions.
• Adaptable loudspeaker-based vocalization2 system ca-
pable of audio synthesis, sample playback, and audio
recording.
3.2 Audio System
Due to the artifact’s use of battery power, the audio sys-
tem must demonstrate reasonable power efficiency while
also supporting the realization of synthesized and relocated
soundscape vocalizations. To support sample playback the
audio system must include non-volatile storage to store au-
dio samples and recordings between installations. A capable
DSP processor is needed to process audio files, manage ef-
fects, and control filtering. A codec is needed to encode
analog microphone voltages into a digital signal and decode
audio data from storage for the DSP processor to operate.
An efficient amplifier must then boost the signal strength
from line to speaker level while a fairly broad-spectrum loud-
speaker then must transduce electronic audio signals from
the amplifier to audible sound. From a technical perspec-
tive, we began the design process for Legatus taking into
consideration the following requirements:
• Common Considerations
– voltage regulator power conversion efficiency above
85%
– minimal external circuitry and PCB layout area
– compatibility with other hardware components and
systems
– support CD quality stereo recording, playback and
DSP at 44.1 kHz with 16-bits
• Codec
– encoding and decoding sample rate of 40 kHz or
greater to capture frequencies up to 20 kHz
– encoding and decoding bit-depth of 16-bits or greater
to support industry standard CD recordings and the
microphone bit-depth
• DSP
– buffer, read, and write stereo I2S audio stream to/from
non-volatile storage at a minimum rate of 10 MB per
minute to support recording and reading stereo .wav
files [13]
– audio rate polyphonic sine, triangle, square, and saw-
tooth wave production
– basic audio effects including equalization, echo, rever-
beration, and distortion
• Non-Volatile Storage
– minimum capacity greater than 7.2 GB to store 12-
hours of stereo recordings
– 10 MB/sec minimum read and write speeds
• Amplifier and Speaker
– minimum reproduction of frequencies from 160 Hz -
17 kHz within ±6 dB
– optimal reproduction of frequencies from 80 Hz - 20
kHz within ±6 dB
– less than 1.0% THD at 81 dB-SPL
2The term vocalization is used in the paper to describe
cochlear content produced by Legatus artifacts and to an-
thropomorphize the artifacts as electronic creatures. It is
not intended to refer to the human or animal voice or to
vowels, and is used in contrast to non-cochlear environmental
feedback produced by the LED feedback system.
3.3 Hardware Systems
Figure 1: Legatus hardware system integration.
Legatus incorporates findings and components from our prior
work creating outdoor soundscape augmentation artifacts
for its hardware, firmware, and physical construction. This
includes, but is not limited to, an array of onboard RGB
LEDs for non-cochlear visual feedback, a transparent acrylic
pipe electronics enclosure, a laser-cut acrylic body, three
adjustable legs, and 3D printed mounting hardware and feet
(Figure 1) [15]. As these related research projects share many
technological implementation elements due to the same high-
level artistic objective and soundscape-specific exhibition
strategy, this paper focuses on the newly explored Legatus
features of loudspeaker-based cochlear feedback and audio
recording.
Figure 2: Legatus PCB top side.
Legatus utilizes a single circular 86 mm diameter PCB that
houses all electronic systems including a Teensy 3.2 micro-
controller that serves as the DSP processor and conduit for
sensor and actuator control (Figures 2 and 3). Environmen-
tal sensors include an ambient light sensor and microphone
on each side of the PCB, a combined temperature and hu-
midity sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU).
Figure 3: Legatus PCB rear side.
User controls include a power switch, two potentiometers,
and six programmable switches which can also be accessed
using wire-to-board connectors. Ten NeoPixel RGB LEDs
are evenly spaced around each side of the PCB’s perimeter
while access to stereo audio output is provided on each side
of the PCB. Two LiPo batteries and a voltage regulator are
positioned onboard to power Legatus during installation.
While the use of solar power was briefly considered for
Legatus, its use was not pursued in favor of battery power
for several reasons. Firstly, the installations for the artifacts
are designed to be self-contained for a single day and require
no energy input during the installations. Additionally, the
use of solar panels would require the use of batteries to store
the energy produced, which would add to the cost of the
units and decrease their transportability. Moreover, solar
panels would limit the control over visual aesthetics and
increase the size of the artifacts. Lastly, if the artifacts were
reliant on solar power, they would only be functional when
light is present, which would limit their exhibition locations
and times3.

California on April 17 th, 2021

MIT license and can be found at https://github.com/
nathanshaw/Legatus
The physical design of Legatus consists of three primary com-
ponents: a rounded equilateral triangle body, a transparent
acrylic tube electronics enclosure, and three legs (Figure 4).
The body has a maximum cross-section of 127 mm while the
enclosure has a width and height of approximately 110 mm.
A 100 mm clear plastic speaker cone is mounted to the top
of the enclosure using screws and silicone sealant while the
bottom of the enclosure consists of a laser-cut bottom cap
with access to physical user controls. Three 8 mm diameter
stainless steel linear rod legs are attached to the body using
3D-printed PETG mounting brackets. A modular foot sys-
tem supports multiple foot materials, shapes, and colors to
accommodate different terrains.
Legatus artifacts weigh just under 1000 g, while the en-
closure provides an equivalent ingress protection rating of
IP54 equating to protection from water splashes from all
directions and the buildup of harmful particulates. Three
identical Legatus artifacts were constructed and exhibited
following a soundscape-specific pop-up exhibition strategy.
4. ARTISTIC REALIZATIONS
Figure 5: Legatus behavior for installation scenario 1: Relo-
cated Soundscapes.
Three Legatus artifacts were exhibited in four distinct instal-
lation scenarios in outdoor locations from May 2021 through
April 2021. Sharing the high-level artistic objective to high-
light and encourage listening to in-situ sonic conditions,
Legatus artifacts are programmed with several shared be-
havior characteristics in the installation scenarios. Among
the shared characteristics is the use of artifact “listening”
periods where Legatus ceases cochlear feedback while provid-
ing audio-reactive LED feedback. This strategy is adapted
from Lockwood and Bielecki’s Wild Energy (see 2.3) and is
intended to direct attention from the artifact to the in-situ
sonic environment. Another shared characteristic is the use
of ambient light, temperature, and humidity sensor data to
drive the length of these listening periods, the brightness
and color of LED feedback, and the length and parameters
of vocalization routines.
4.1 Installation Scenario 1: Spatially
Relocated Soundscapes
Figure 6: Legatus behavior for installation scenario 2: Tem-
porally Relocated Soundscapes.
As demonstrated by works such as Ogboh’s Lagos Sound-
scapes and Kuhn’s LICHT, soundscape relocation is a proven
strategy for augmenting sonic environments and promot-
ing cochlear and physical exploration. In actualization of
this augmentation strategy, the first installation scenario
augments outdoor in-situ sonic environments by relocat-
ing sounds over space and time (Figure 5). The samples
selected for playback aim to foster connections to the ex-
hibition venue by leveraging components of the location’s
history, culture, geography, and biological characteristics,
and include field recordings of industrial factories, natural
soundscapes, burning fires, and sewing machines. As can be
seen in publicly available video documentation [16], each of
the sample sets (industrial, nature soundscapes, fire burning,
etc.) produced drastically varied emotional undercurrents
to the exhibition locations.
4.2 Installation Scenario 2: Temporally
Relocated Soundscapes
Figure 7: Legatus behavior for installation scenario 3: Sus-
tained Pitches
The second scenario focuses on artifacts listening to the
in-situ sonic environment, recording loud and abrupt sounds,
and playing back its recordings at the location a short period
later (Figure 6). This installation scenario draws artistic in-
spiration from a social phenomenon called “the echo chamber
effect” [3]. With these inspirations, Legatus creates real-time
soundscape augmentations that amplify, repeat, exaggerate,
and distort audio recordings of the in-situ sonic environment.
Recording is engaged at the very start of the installation
so Legatus can capture critical sonic events and is only
stopped when the artifact is vocalizing. When Legatus
does not hear a response to its vocalizations, it repeats
its previously recorded sample at a slightly higher gain
until it gets a response from the sonic environment. If no
new sonic events are identified, Legatus repeats the same
sample at a higher and higher amplitude. After several
repetitions, the gain increases so high that the sample is
distorted beyond recognition. After a period of several
minutes, to ensure visitors are given the time and sonic
space to listen to environmental sounds, Legatus ceases its
normal vocalization routine to engage in a listening period.
4.3 Installation Scenario 3: Sustained Pitches
The third installation scenario tasks Legatus artifacts to
enact a part from David Dunn’s installation series PLACE:
A Performance in Ten Parts(1975) that instructs perform-
ers to “sustain pitches in response to pitches heard in the
environment”. To realize this installation scenario, real-time
pitch detection listens for the presence of a dominant fre-
quency in the sonic environment (Figure 7). The higher the
confidence that a pitch is present the higher the chance of
vocalizing. When vocalizing, Legatus harmonize with the
Figure 8: Legatus behavior for installation scenario 4: Feed-
back Chamber
identified pitch by vocalizing a tone randomly transposed
up or down by harmonic intervals.
4.4 Installation Scenario 4: Feedback Cham-
ber
The fourth Legatus installation scenario explores mapping
environmental sensor readings to influence the parameters
of an FM synthesis system while also following the portion
of Pauline Oliveros’s score for Environmental Dialoguethat
reads, “as each person becomes aware of the field of sounds
from the environment, each person individually and gradu-
ally begins to reinforce the pitch of one of the sound sources
that has attracted their attention” [12].
The realization of this portion of Environmental Dialogue
involves Legatus artifacts embodying the role of the “person”
by listening to the in-situ sonic environment, extracting
high-level meaning from the sounds it hears, and using its
analysis to determine its vocalization parameter (Figure 8).
This realization utilizes an FM synthesis engine and takes
advantage of audio effects such as echo and reverberation.
The frequency of the modular oscillator is determined by
ambient light, temperature, and humidity while the carrier’s
frequency is the dominant pitch identified by the artifact’s
pitch detection routine.
5. INITIAL FINDINGS
5.1 Transportability
Legatus’s light weight and relatively small size made it easy
for a single person to transport multiple artifact instances to
outdoor installation venues. By removing the artifact’s legs
during transportation they fit within a standard hiking pack
along with provisions and other soundscape augmentation
artifacts.
However, due to the use of acrylic as a primary building
material and the placement of the loudspeaker exposed on
the top of the electronics enclosure, Legatus can be damaged
if mishandled and must be protected when packed for air
travel. While conducting fieldwork, the setting up and
dismantling of Legatus artifacts was streamlined. The setup
time for each Legatus artifact was usually shorter than five
minutes, while artifact dismantling took significantly less
time at less than a minute per artifact. The majority of setup
time was spent choosing the appropriate feet, positioning
the legs, and adjusting physical user controls to optimize
microphone sensitivity and playback gain.
During the test installations, the ability to install multiple
artifact instances afforded larger augmented environments
and the ability to stage interactions between Legatus in-
stances by placing artifacts close to each other. While close
artifact placement can increase the artistic effectiveness of
some installation scenarios, such as with the Temporally
Relocated Soundscapes scenario, this strategy must be care-
fully managed, as on some occasions, the vocalizations of
multiple nearby Legatus artifacts clashed with the compar-
atively quiet in-situ soundscape to generate dissonant and
chaotic augmentations.
5.2 Environmental Reactivity
While the timing and quality of Legatus vocalizations during
exhibitions were directly influenced by light, temperature,
humidity, and ambient sound, for many installation scenar-
ios the mapping was too abstracted to easily be correlated
with changes in environmental conditions. While these map-
pings provide intriguing artistic implications that support
our objective to direct attention to environmental conditions,
future work could benefit from exploring alternate environ-
mental mappings which can more readily be identified by
visitors without prior knowledge of their existence. Future
realizations will additionally explore strategies such as di-
rectly mapping ambient light to vocalization amplitude for
optimizing artifact vocalization gain and behavior routines.
5.3 Non-Cochlear Visual Feedback
The LEDs distributed on the top and bottom of the PCB
combined with the transparent plastic building materials
used for the loudspeaker, enclosure, and body resulted in
a visual feedback system that was effective at directing at-
tention to the in-situ sonic environment [16]. If Legatus did
not provide visual feedback between its vocalizations during
its listening periods, it is reasonable for observers to assume
the exhibition is either concluded or taking a break. As
the purpose of these periods of non-vocalization is to redi-
rect attention to the natural sonic environment, the visual
feedback helped to transition attention from the artifact’s
vocalizations to the sounds present in the environment.
6. CONCLUSIONS
Legatus hardware represents an expansion of our prior explo-
rations with soundscape augmentation in outdoor natural

environments [14, 15] by recording audio, playing audio
samples, and synthesizing vocalizations. The Legatus sound-
scape augmentation artifact was introduced as a lightweight,
simple, adaptable, self-powered, environmentally reactive,
and environmentally protected device for creating sonic art
installations in outdoor natural environments. Four test in-
stallation scenarios were realized in-situ to test the artifact’s
cochlear feedback and audio capture systems. Through its
artistic and technological performance during this fieldwork,
Legatus demonstrates high artistic promise as a cost-effective,
easy-to-use, adaptable, soundscape augmentation artifact
capable of realizing sonic art installations in locations where
these works are rarely exhibited.
6.1 Future Work
To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact
of Legatus, future work will involve examining the expe-
riences of both the audience and artists. While valuable
observational data can be obtained from installation facili-
tators, feedback from the public and critical perspectives is
also necessary. However, due to COVID-19-related research
limitations, including limited exhibition options and fund-
ing, gathering non-biased feedback has been challenging. As
external restrictions gradually ease, future work will focus
on comparing the effectiveness of Legatus’s soundscape aug-
mentation strategies in promoting and encouraging in-situ
environmental listening to the strategies explored in prior
research projects.
In addition, exploring the potential for networking Lega-
tus devices could be an interesting area for future work.
Multichannel audio is often advantageous in sound instal-
lations, and Legatus devices could communicate with each
other to create a more immersive sonic experience. This
could entail integrating Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other methods
of establishing a network with each other or with nodes in
other locations, such as a laptop or command unit. By tak-
ing advantage of Legatus’s capabilities, a network could be
relatively cheap and low-power using ESP32 microcontrollers
instead of the current Teensy 3.2 microcontrollers.
Furthermore, Legatus has the potential to be used in other
disciplines, such as a monitor for computer music perfor-
mance or as an environmentally protected combined short-
term audio and environmental data collection device. The
artifacts’ ambient light sensors could trigger audio recordings
of sonorous dawn and dusk choruses, which could be com-
pared to temperature, humidity, and lighting data collected
during the same period using the sensor array. Legatus
was initially designed for outdoor soundscape augmentation;
however, there is no technological obstacle preventing it from
being exhibited indoors or in outdoor environments with
higher concentrations of people.
7. ETHICAL STANDARDS
This research was conducted in adherence with the ethical
standards of the Victoria University of Wellington, includ-
ing guidelines for the ethical treatment of animals and the
protection of the environment. The hardware and firmware
systems are open-source under the MIT license 4. To min-
imize potential negative impacts on the environment and
its inhabitants, we took careful measures during the design,
installation, and use of our hardware. Specifically, expedi-
tions were conducted for short periods of a day or less, with
a focus on leaving the environment cleaner than we found
it. We also ensured that our interactions with animals were
conducted in a responsible manner, and that the impact of
our presence was similar to that of a loud hiker or camper.
The installations were all installed legally on public land
or private property with explicit permission, and we made
a concerted effort to minimize the risk of environmental
pollution resulting from the use of our hardware by ensur-
ing all equipment is accounted for and transported out of
installation locations. Our research team remained vigilant
in ensuring ethical and responsible conduct throughout the
course of our work. We welcome further discussion on these
important ethical considerations.
