Abstract
Self-resonating vibrotactile instruments (SRIs) are hybrid feedback instruments, 
characterised by an electro-mechanical feedback loop that is both the means of sound 
production and the expressive interface. Through the lens of contemporary SRIs, we 
reflect on how they are characterised, designed, and played. By considering reports 
from designers and players of this species of instrument-performance system, we 
explore the experience of playing them. With a view to supporting future research and 
practice in the field, we illustrate the value of conceptualising SRIs in Cybernetic and 
systems theoretic terms and suggest that this offers an intuitive, yet powerful basis for 
future performance, analysis and making; in doing so we close the loop in the making, 
playing and conceptualisation of SRIs with the aim of nourishing the evolution of 
theory, creative and technical practice in this field.

amplified flow of vibrations, as their principle method of sound production and 
manipulation. These instruments typically employ an actuator and pickup (for 
simplicity we will use “pickup” to refer to any method of transducing acoustic 
vibrations to an electrical signal), coupled through resonant material(s), and connected 
in a feedback loop which invariably passes through analogue and/or digital  signal 
processing. As illustrated in Figure 1, numerous interaction affordances are created 
for the player, who can intervene in the signal flow at various points, or interface via 
the physically resonating material (e.g. strings, membrane, air) of the instrument; 
these interventions influence the structure of the instrument and therefore the sound 
production and behavioural response.  As acoustic-electronic/digital hybrids,  they 
offer the gestural, embodied, intuitive affordances of the resonant physical bodies of 
acoustic instruments, and the real-time programmable, reconfigurable possibilities of 
electronic and software instruments [1][2]. In offering feedback manipulation as the 
primary method of musician-machine engagement, they add to a growing coterie of 
NIMEs that challenge conventional top-down models of instrumental control and 
agency, and create new possibilities, as well as issues, in contemporary music, lutherie 
and instrumental practice.

Responding to the growing energy and excitement in this research field, the aim of this 
paper is firstly to unpack the emerging trends in lutherie and artistic practice, 
secondly to reflect on the experience of playing these instruments,  and finally, to 
expound a conceptual framework to scaffold future work; in doing so we hope to 
create a productive feedback loop to nourish the evolution of creative and technical 
practice in this field.  We start by locating SRIs within the wider historical landscape of 
feedback instruments;  we next consider the ways in which self-resonating feedback 
instruments are assembled, and the phenomenological experiences reported by those 
that are developing committed SRI performance practices. In order to try and 
understand the experience of playing these instruments in terms of their material and 
systemic characteristics we take a journey into the language and concepts of early 
British cybernetics, systems theory and contemporary neuroscience; these concepts 
are not new in experimental music discourse, but we suggest that these are rich tools

to add to NIME cultural compendium, offering both rich imagery to guide us in 
performance time, and precise analytic tools to help us better understand and make 
the next generation of instruments. We close by reflecting on the value of feedback 
musicking as complexity tutors. 
Feedback Musicianship
SRIs follow a long tradition of instrument design and artistic practice that uses 
feedback as a creative material and method of engagement. Electroacoustic feedback 
was first characterised by Larsen [3], as convergence to a pure tone in a system with 
positive loop gain.  The Larsen effect might be seen as problematic to instrument 
designers, for example in the early development of electric guitars.  However, 
musicians soon began to develop techniques for manipulating the Larsen effect 
musically. Early examples are Guitar Slim’s  hollow-body guitar feedback in the early 
1950s,  and Jimi Hendrix’s virtuosic use of guitar-amplifier feedback [4].  Beyond the 
world of guitar music, early experiments with feedback took a variety of forms: Eliane 
Radigue’s early work with microphones and tape machine feedback [5];  Nicolas 
Collins’ use of microphone and room acoustics in Pea Soup; David Tudor’s 
assemblages of actuated objects,’ Roland Kayn’s cybernetic synthesis systems; and 
works from Lucier, Reich, Cage, Mumma, Ashley, and many more (see [6] for an 
excellent summary and analytic framework).   
More recent examples of burgeoning feedback musicianship encompass ecosystemic 
approaches (Di Scipio [7]), non-linear dynamical (Mudd [8] , Sanfilippo [9]) and 
interactive software systems (de Campo [10]),  analogue synthesis (Watson [11]), no-
input mixing [12], and the particular niche we focus on here, SRIs.  While there are 
many ways to cut across the variety of forms in feedback instruments, we carve this 
division of SRIs based on how musicians engage with these instruments through 
embodied, vibrotactile interaction, and by locating them within the contexts of ongoing 
research in NIME on augmented and hyper-instruments.
Feedback and Self-Resonating Instruments
We see research in this area emerging in the 2000s with instruments such as the Feed-
Drum, Bower’s and Sander’s Long String (described in [13]) and early halldorophones. 
 Sanfilipoo and Valle’s 2013 review of feedback systems [6] draws together underlying 
principles and historical artistic practice.  Our list of examplar instruments in (ref?) 
shows increasing recent activity in the development of new SRIs.  We attempt to 
describe SRIs by looking at their characteristic design patterns and principles, the

varieties of primary resonant materials used, the ways in which luthiers and 
performers experience these instruments, and the ways in which SRIs can be 
conceptualised based on common understandings of feedback musicianship, rooted in 
cybernetics and complex systems.
Making and Interacting with SRIs
In terms of fabrication SRIs make use of the same traditional handcrafting, modern 
prototyping and fabrication techniques, or some combination thereof as other NIMEs. 
Setting SRIs apart however is the nature of primary sound production mechanism, 
namely self-resonance through electro-mechanical feedback. This self-resonance 
through feedback is the core design pattern that distinguishes SRIs from other 
resonator instruments on the one hand (such as McPherson’s Magnetic Resonator 
Piano [14]) and non-resonating feedback instruments on the other (such as Hendrix’s 
guitar). As with traditional acoustic instruments, the resultant sound quality and 
behaviour of the instrument is intimately influenced by the resonant qualities of the 
constituent materials, the design and craftsmanship of assembleage, unlike other 
excellent software feedback instruments that have similar non-linear, complex 
dynamics (e.g.[7][8] [9] [10]).
Feedback musicianship originally evolved through exaptation (wherein a feature is 
utilised for a different function than originally intended): Musicians’ use and abuse of 
amplification led to the closing of a loop, creating feedback, an acoustic feature not 
originally intended by the designer(s) of the pickup/amplification system [4]. However, 
contemporary SRIs are a new species of feedback instruments in which  designers and 
luthiers consciously and deliberately incorporate feedback loops as a central design 
principle to create self-resonance. We see this as an emerging track in the research 
field, and are excited by the possibilities of sound production and modes of interaction 
it affords.
Definition 
We define self-resonating vibrotactile feedback instruments in terms of the following 
qualities:
1. A feedback loop is created between a pick-up and an electro-mechanical actuator via 
resonant material(s) (e.g. strings, membranes etc.) causing  self-resonation. This is 
the primary sound producing mechanism; the  properties of the resonant materials 
colour the vibrations, influencing the resultant acoustic properties of the instrument.

Such vibrotactile playing incorporates direct and ongoing / sustained haptic 
interaction between performer and instrument, creating multiple modalities of 
embodied interaction for feedback musicianship affording rich musical expression and 
engaging performance. 
 (ref?) gives a representative but non-exhaustive list of the core examples of SRIs.  The 
Parameter and Variable columns describe ways in which the player can influence the 
behaviour of the instrument; see below for further explication.
2. The self-resonating system is intimately sensitive to physical interaction by the 
player, creating the potential for vibrotactile interfaces through which the musician 
can influence the behaviour of the instrument.

We can also make a grouping of these instruments through their primary resonant 
materials, which also define their main sonic and expressive affordances.
Strings and Springs
These instruments typically use one or several exciters to vibrate a surface which 
vibrates a string. For example, the halldorophone and family of feedback string 
instruments (including cellos and basses) vibrate an acoustic body through a mounted 
speaker which in turn vibrates their strings. The Fjaerlett slightly differs by directly 
vibrating its springs.  The player can then engage with the instrument directly by 
touching, exciting or damping the strings or body.  Electromagnetic pickups transduce 
the mechanical vibration of the strings into an electrical signal which is processed and 
amplified.
Air and Tubes
In these instruments the air column is resonated by a speaker; players engage with 
them through touch (valves or keys) or by altering the shape of their mouth cavity 
which extends the instrument body;  tactile perception of the vibrations in the 
instrument body plays an important proprioceptive role.  These instruments take 
varying approaches to transducer placement; in the most played version of the 
thranophone the feedback is created between a microphone in the player’s mouth and 
a speaker mounted in the bell of a tuba; varying position of the speaker creates a 
further expressive interface. The feedback trombone reverses this arrangement, and 
the feedback clarinet uses multiple microphone placements throughout the system.

Membranes and Surfaces
These instruments use piezo contact microphones to pick up surface vibrations either 
mounted directly on the surface, or in the special case of Brandtsegg’s polycarbonate 
plate, mounted on the finger, such that the finger becomes part of the vibrational 
pathway of the instrument. The Piezothing and C-Bow are both portable and surface-
agnostic, allowing manipulation through device placement and surface damping or 
excitement.
Assemblages
Many of these instruments could be classed as assemblages; others are primarily 
characterised as being such. Stapleton’s Volatile Assemblage (VOLA) includes a 
resonant metal chamber, vibrated with an exciter, and with different materials and 
devices that can be introduced into the actuated feedback loop (string, balls, rods).
Signal Processing 
Many of these instruments use gain control besides manipulating physical resonances 
as the main point of interaction, while others take varied approaches to signal 
processing. The thranophone (as played by Ingi Garðar Erlendsson) optionally includes 
an array of guitar pedals, and the Fjaerlett offers analog equalisation. Others afford 
digital signal processing allowing for system state analysis and manipulation; the FAAB 
has embedded DSP on a Bela board, the Feral Cello is routed through Max/MSP and 
the Feedback Cello can switch between algorithms in SuperCollider.  These external 
processes are manipulated either by on-body controls (e.g. the halldorophone) or 
external devices (foot pedals, mixers, laptops), principally using scientific 
instrumentation style controls and/or GUIs. In the case of CoFlo [33], signal processing 
is directly intended to shape instrument behaviour as well as sound.
Experiencing SRIs
Examining the qualities of playing SRIs compared to that of musical instruments where 
input has a more predictable, consistent output, we find a commonly reported theme of 
having to dialogue with the instrument. This resonates with ongoing discussions in 
contemporary music that question conventional assumptions of top-down, linear 
performance models [34][35][36]. In the words of composer and thranophone player 
Ingi Garðar Erlendsson [37]: 
“For a composer it's amazing that I cannot trust the instrument being the same today 
as it was yesterday… 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Self-resonating Vibrotactile Feedback Instruments ||: Making, Playing,
Conceptualising :||
12
Interviewer: How do you feel about that? 
Ingi: I think that's great! I'm enjoying the instrument more and more. I like that I can't 
be sure if the instrument is always going to be the same. Also my composition is such 
that I'm always re-inventing the method, and I really like that, having an instrument 
that forces me to continually re-discover it.”  
There is also a sense of having to engage SRIs in a fundamentally different way to the 
acoustic instrument it is based on (when applicable), as for double bass player Adam 
Pultz Melbye when playing the FAAB: “The adaptive and often nonlinear behaviour of 
the instrument imbues it with a sense of autonomy that, on the one hand supports 
exploration, and on the other, resists the traditional notion of instrumental mastery”  
[38].  
SRI players can become emphatic about the joy of negotiating a responsive  but 
chaotic instrument, as Úlfarsson found in interviews with long term users of his 
halldorophone; this is encapsulated beautifully by composer (and performer of her own 
music) Hildur Guðnadóttir: 
“You need to be a 110% present physically, if you even move your knee or something 
he might decide to stop and I find that thrilling. How you have to adjust your whole 
approach to the instrument and how conscious I have to be of my whole body...” [39] 
This focusing of attention is reported by Paul Stapleton, who describes the experience 
of the instrument in the language of complex systems: 
“Playing with self-resonating feedback instruments demands that I pay close attention. 
The most satisfying feedback music seems to be at the thresholds and breaking points, 
and these are rarely stable. And this is a good thing, because stability (or equilibrium) 
actually means death, where uncertainty, chaos and contingent connections are the 
realm of the living.” [40]
In fact there is anecdotal evidence from the work of Snyder et al to suggest that 
players feel quite disappointed when the characteristics wildness of SRIs is dialled 
down. In their research, a parameter was introduced to use the feedbacking 
mechanism primarily as a method to drive accurate note generation. The reported 
that: 
“The performers liked the wildness of the feedback mode, but actually found very little 
sonic difference between “synthesis mode” and “feedback mode” when the Q of the 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Self-resonating Vibrotactile Feedback Instruments ||: Making, Playing,
Conceptualising :||
13
bandpass filter was high enough to force near instantaneous changes between partials. 
A very high Q on the filter and a quantized stepping between cutoff frequencies were 
both settings on the instrument that increased the pitch accuracy of “feedback mode”, 
but the resulting gain in stability was accompanied by a loss of what was 
characteristically exciting about the feedback sound. This suggested that in order to 
make the feedback mechanism worth implementing, certain elements and artifacts of 
that sound needed to be preserved, such as the characteristic struggling timbral shift 
as feedback breaks from one partial to another.”[27]
Comments from performers suggest that these SRIs are approached as somewhat 
lively beasts and render obsolete the classical interaction metaphors of musical 
instruments both acoustic and digital: learned and fixed sensory motor contingencies 
which underly virtuosity in the classical sense are out the window: control and mastery 
gives way to a sense of following a path as it unfolds [41].  But the path also changes. 
The job of the performer in SRIs is not to inject energy into the system and completely 
control the instrument (as in classical string, wind or percussion instruments), but to 
navigate along, intervene in,  negotiate or even argue with the pre-existing flows of 
(vibrational) energy. In other words: Feedback performance is quintessentially 
processual: It is the antithesis of what Ingold describes as Hylomorphic Making — the 
Aristotelean concept of imposing a predetermined  form (morphe) on matter (Hyle) 
[42]: rather than deciding first and then acting, in playing SRIs decisions unfold within 
ongoing actions.
SRI players, all comment on the appeal of these uncontrollable, unpredictable  
systems, often ascribing them musical agency. Metaphors are useful in performance, 
but as engineers how can we understand the origins of this agency? can we relate 
performance phenomenology to systemic structure, material properties? can we infer 
and therefore evolve design principles? 
Conceptualising SRIs
“We start by assuming that we have before us some dynamic system … We wish to 
study it” - Ross Ashby Design for a Brain [43] p.13
Many musicians are drawn to using cybernetic language, often sprinkled in discourse 
with other poetic language of that ascribes agency, autonomy, and/or composerly 
control to their instruments or performance systems. These perspectives are 
complementary to other more symbolic conceptualizations of instrumentality, as 
exemplified in Magnusson's work [44], in focusing on dynamic and behavioral 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Self-resonating Vibrotactile Feedback Instruments ||: Making, Playing,
Conceptualising :||
14
processes. The language of dynamical systems theory and cybernetics is a rich source 
of poetic metaphor which perfectly captures the behaviour we experience in these 
instruments; but it is also a precise technical language allied with mathematical 
analysis tools and this has been less well explored. The desire to understand the 
relationship between formal system structure and resultant behaviour lay at the heart 
of the early cybernetic enterprise.  We see at least three reasons therefore why it is 
useful to adopt these terms formally when working with SRIs. Firstly, the aim of 
systems thinking in general is to describe the behaviour of a system irrespective of the 
materials in which it is constituted (mechanical, biological etc.) - this helps to focus on 
general design principles rather than specific examples. Secondly, we are interested in 
better understanding what it is about these instruments that invite attributions of 
agency, but to use language that ascribes intentionality to the instrument is circular:  
we want to understand the qualities of the instrument behaviour that as players we 
perceive to take an active role in the musical dialog. Cyberneticians like Ross Ashby 
were concerned with understanding the origins of adaptive behaviour in terms of 
system structure, so similarly withheld from teleological descriptions. This language is 
both poetic, and precise; it meets our needs as musicians and makers.
Thirdly, we are interested in analysis for the sake of future synthesis - to keeping 
iterating around the loop of making, playing, reflecting and to complement musical 
experimentation with empirical experimentation. But our instruments are too complex 
for standard analyses:  For example, if we want to better understand the relationship 
between the physical structure of a violin body, the sound it makes and the experience 
of playing it, we can do experiments like modal testing. But SRIs are typically more 
and less tightly knit assemblages of a variety of different materials, often in dynamic 
relationships, such that they defy traditional methods of acoustic/ mechanical analysis 
just as they defy classical metaphors of musical interaction.  Cybernetic terms were 
created precisely for describing and analysing dynamic, complex systems, where 
traditional analysis (conceptual and technical) fail. Language and concepts that help us 
better conceptualise, discuss as well as analyse the behaviour of the instruments can 
support the next iteration, generation or species of SRIs.
In defining dynamic systems, Ashby starts with variable which he defines as “a 
measurable quantity which at every instant has a definite numerical value” ([43] p 14). 
In digital instruments, every variable is declared and defined by its musician-coder 
creator (perhaps mediated by a neural network or other statistical model) this is 
deeply familiar; in the acoustic and analogue components of feedback instruments, we 
cannot specify every variable, but we are learning which are the most influential (such 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Self-resonating Vibrotactile Feedback Instruments ||: Making, Playing,
Conceptualising :||
15
as micro-settings on DSP).  A system then is simply “an arbitrary selected set of 
variables”, which are nominated by the experimenter. We draw the system boundary to 
suit our concerns; in Figure 1 we consider the player and instrument as separate but 
coupled systems, so that we can better understand how the structure of the SRI gives 
rise to its characteristic dynamical behaviours. At other times it might be valuable to 
consider sub-systems of the instrument. For example, Fig 2. shows phase portraits of 
each of the strings of a Feedback Cello (FBC).  In other cases we cannot sensibly 
separate performer from instrument, as in the thranophone where the pickup (cardioid 
microphone) is placed inside the player’s mouth and their mouth cavity completes the 
acoustic chamber within which the primary resonant medium (air) vibrates.
The state of the system is described by the values of its variables at a specific instant. 
For example, we can describe the state of strings on a FBC by measuring the 
amplitude of the signal on their respective pick-ups. A line of behaviour is specified 
by a trajectory between states. This formal definition of behaviour aligns well with our 
intuitive use of the term: the FBC behaves differently when we bow it or strike it. 
The behaviour of an oscillator is cyclical; such simple behaviours can be described 
mathematically, but most short and long term SRI behaviours defy such description 
and are better represented in phase-space. A phase portrait is an N dimensional plot 
of N variables against each other (imagine a system composed of 2 variables, then its 
state can be represented by two numbers and its line of behaviour can be plotted for 
all the states it passes through). Phase portraits of higher dimensional systems can 
also be generated from time-series data using embedding methods. We can infer the 
behaviour of the strings by recording the signal from the pick-ups and generating a 
phase portrait for each (Fig 2). This analysis gives insight into how the cross-coupling 
between strings is dependent on their tuning and alters the behaviour of the whole 
instrument system and complements intuition and experimentation in choosing 
appropriate tunings (aka system parameters)

Fig 2. Phase space reconstructions using time-delay embeddings provide portraits for 
each of the four main strings on a feedback cello in action. Axes denote relative 
amplitude.
As an example of putting these concepts into play: If we plotted a phase portrait for 
each string for every possible state of every other part of the feedback cello, we would 
gain insight into the system’s field - the phase space containing all the lines of 
behaviour found by releasing the system from all possible initial states. This is known 
as a field of attractors in complexity science. The SRI player will discover attractors 
through exploration of resistances and confluences of the instrument, and can play the 
instrument by attempting to navigate trajectories between attractors. They might also 
experience a ‘golden-zone’ where a delicate balance of multiple attractors offers a rich 
though transient landscape.  
Finally, a variable not included in the system is a parameter. As Ashby describes “A 
change in the value of an effective parameter changes the line of behaviour from each 
state.” (p 72) It follows then that a change in the value of an effective parameter 
changes the field of behaviours. In performing with SRIs, actions through which we 
navigate attractors, can also effectively re-parameterise the system, such as detuning a 
string-based SRI, such that attractors can shift or disappear. 
These basic terms that Ashby takes pains to clearly define for his investigation of the 
origins of adaptive behaviour provide a convenient frame to understand the 
relationship between the structure of our instruments and their possible behaviours. 
For example, understanding phase space in terms of number of variables formalises 
intuitions and experience that these SRIs afford greater musical complexity than the 
naked Larsen effect between a speaker and a mic in the open air. There are a greater 
number of variables in play, so also a larger state space and wider field of possible 
behaviours. When designing or preparing for performance, decisions over setting of 
high-level gains, filter coefficients, tightness of transducer screws, material properties 
of primary resonators, tube length or string tuning, are all parameters which define 
the set of possible behaviours. 
These helps us differentiate the parameter settings which define the range of 
behaviours (field) - main gain setting, string tuning, changes to length of thranophone 
with hosepipe - versus those performance-time changes that perturb the system within 
the lines of a given behaviour; we might also reconfigure parameters in performance 
time and then we are faced with a new instrument.

“Being a composer it's amazing that I cannot trust the instrument, that it is the same 
today as it was yesterday, that it is the same in one space or another. Although usually 
it's quite similar.” - Ingi
We tentatively suggest a core design principle of SRIs is to create systems with 
multiple attractors, as opposed to the vanilla Larsen effect or single string system 
which is itself complex in the technical sense, but always settles to the same single 
point.
Having understood this basic relationship between parameters, variables and 
behaviours, wider Cybernetic and systems thinking can help us understand the 
particular alluring, uncontrollable characteristics. The recursive feedback at the heart 
of these instruments creates a circular causality [45]:  cause and effect - origin and 
consequence - cannot be distinguished. Circular causality in turn creates non-
linearity (see [46] [47] for a full explanation in terms of superposition). Non-linearity 
means that small changes (at any point in the system -  Fig 1) can have a profound 
effect on system behaviour.
As well as small parameter changes creating changes in the behavioural state space, 
this non-linearity creates the fundamentally and delightfully unpredictable behaviour 
that is characteristic of feedback instruments: the familiar gesture-sound producing 
mapping of the acoustic cello is not only radically disrupted, but as predictability 
decreases, expectation and control become less viable performance strategies. 
Interface-acoustic mappings are not only non-linear but rapidly and at times 
unpredictably reconfigured: any learned sensory-motor contingencies may (or may not) 
be redundant. 
Beyond simply unpredictable, many musicians intuitively use language that ascribes 
musical agency to SRIs. How can we similarly understand this experience? Sitting at 
the intersection of music, aesthetics, engineering and philosophy, agency, or perhaps 
more simply, autonomy can mean a wide variety of things: mathematics (ordinary 
differential equations which does not explicitly depend on the independent variable) 
politics (self-governance),  robotics (the ability to self-recharge), biology 
(organisational closure); as a lively, but not living system and sharing an interest in 
practical applicability, we find the Artificial Life approach useful. Here autonomy is 
defined in terms of the degree of self-determination of a system [48]. More recently in 
Neuroscience, Seth has amplified Bertschinger and colleagues’ definition [49] to 
understand autonomy as a system that is not fully determined by it’s environment [50], 
whilst noting that a random system should not have a high autonomy value. As above,

following Ashby, the environment of the feedback instrument consists of both the 
performer (including body and cognitive system) and the ambient space within which 
its signals flow (typically a spatially extended room).
This concept of self-determination captures Feedback musician’s descriptions of the 
experience of performing with SRIs: “When things are going well, playing VOLA’s 
feedback and resonances feels like dancing with another partner. My training, 
decisions and actions matter during performance, but they clearly don’t exclusively 
determine the resulting music.” - Paul Stapleton  [51]
The degree to which a system is determined by its environment can also be measured 
using time-series causality measures (e.g. [52] , [53]). This provides an analysis tool 
with which to better understand the experiential affordances of particular parameter 
settings, material or systemic changes in instrument design, so better informing the 
iterative design and practice loop.  We might sensibly question whether the 
instruments are really unpredictable, or whether we just haven’t done enough practice 
yet. Under this definition we can check. Systems language therefore is not only a 
productive creative metaphor but a critical analysis tool in supporting our iterative 
cycle of making and playing new musical instruments. 
Finally, Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety is useful in helping us understand the role 
of performance practice, not in ‘mastering’ the instrument in terms of absolute control, 
but in maintaining musically-viable and interesting behaviour. We noted above that a 
larger state space afforded a wider range of behaviours. The Law of Requisite Variety 
states that: “The larger the variety of actions available to a control system, the larger 
the variety of perturbations it is able to compensate” [43] . In other words, the state 
space of the ‘control’ system has to be at least as large as the state space of the 
physical system it’s controlling (if you want to balance a broom on your finger, you 
need to be able to move left and right as well as forwards and backwards). If it isn’t, 
then the physical system can get into states that the control system won’t be able to 
deal with. Increasing complexity of the components of SRIs increases the musical 
possibilities by creating richer variable space - and therefore state space and space of 
musical possibilities: but this requires practice and a new form of mastery - the 
musical technique to dance with the instrument along the lines of behaviour as they 
emerge. This need is already recognised and expressed in the first generation of 
feedback experts:
“But it really is a monster now because you have so many options for playing. Which I 
don't think people recognized in the beginning, because it's basically just feedback so I

don't think people recognized how rich it can be. The perception was that it is too 
primitive. But taking it from there if you, hmm, take care, if you practice the system, 
the instrument, if you develop a performance practice and work through [technical] 
problems that come up it's cool.” - Ingi 
Summary and Conclusion
We have sketched out the feedback path that defines the SRIs and attempted to tell a 
circular story that couples material and schema, experience and formal principles. 
Through the lens of contemporary instruments, we have examined design patterns, 
concepts, and principles in making SRIs; we have shared experiences of performers 
and makers and dove deep into cybernetic and systems principles in order to explore 
whether  the language we intuitively use of autonomy, complexity and attractors is 
formally defensible and accurate, and more imporantly productive and generative. 
Taking a journey into the careful conceptual definitions and language of Ross Ashby, 
together with wider systems thinking we have shown that this language does indeed 
help us conceptualise and analyse our SRIs, providing formal insights that align with 
experiential reports which begin to point to guiding heuristics, if not design principles 
for future SRIs. These formal and conceptual tools support out intuitive performance-
time experiments, informing future instrumental practice and feedback musicianship. 
We find  that, through making, playing with, contemplating and conceptualising these 
instruments they are first grade complexity tutors: in assembling them we come to 
understand how complexity emerges from the interaction of simple components, in this 
case coupled together with feedback; and in playing them we come to learn that life is 
not necessarily most fun when we are in control.
