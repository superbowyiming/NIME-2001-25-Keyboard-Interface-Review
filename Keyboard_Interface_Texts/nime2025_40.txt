Abstract
The Aquapella is a hand-held gestural instrument for exploring
the unique relationship of liquid turbulence and musical expres-
sion. The device consists of eight conductive water-level sensors
in a custom 3D printed container. As a musician moves the de-
vice, it generates a chaotic flow of water within the container and
translates the motion into real-time midi signals for audio-visual
interpretation. In our initial performances and tests with the
Aquapella, we have focused on turning the flowing characteris-
tics of the device into ambient and glitch soundscapes that move
between noise and harmonics. We present the primary findings
in developing the Aquapella including related works, description
of the project development, and ideas for future iterations.

1 Introduction
The Aquapella is a hand-held gestural instrument for exploring
the unique relationship of chaotic physics and digital art within
musical performance. A musician holds the device in one or
more hands, tilting and swirling the water in various ways. The
internal sensors pick up and translate the turbulent flow of water
into MIDI signals that produce a wide variety of sounds when

connected to a digital audio workstation (DAW). The Aquapella’s
weighted feel, hand-held ergonomics, and immediacy provide
a uniquely expressive computer interface that we are using for
musical performance. The attached static camera observes the
surface of the water with a circular light from above, enabling a
tightly coupled visual component for live audio-visual display.

The following provides an examination of related works, what
makes the Aquapella unique, the development process, relevant
findings, and future applications and possible iterations of our
work.
2 Related Works
While developing this device, we drew inspiration from prior
research involving gestural NIME’s that map motion, sensory
dynamics, or malleable material to sound, often in a hand-held
form. Additionally, we reviewed and were inspired by multiple
NIME’s that involve the use of water directly and indirectly,
or that use gestures to manipulate live voice input. Finally, we
elaborate on a few selected artworks and performances that have
motivated our work with water and speak more to the aesthetic
and psychological undertones of chaotic liquid propagation.
2.1 Hand-held Gestural devices
There is something particular about how human hands can map
to musical expression, and there is no shortage of hand-held
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Lettang et al.
examples that forerun or prefigure the Aquapella. Within the
NIME conference itself, we find direct examples of hand held
instruments such as Eric Singer’s classic Sonic Banana[18], the
T-Stick[6, 10, 14], and Thales[17] that map the movement of a
device in hand to sonic abstractions of various kinds. Orba[ 1]
is a commercial example that we have spent time with. Other
hand devices (outside of the traditional data glove) that correlate
finger gestures to acoustic impressions, but are also informa-
tive, are David Wessel’s Hands On[ 20], Pardue et. al’s Hand-
Controller[15] and Lane-Smith et. al’s Hapstrument[9].
2.2 Gestural interfaces as Sculpture
Many acoustic instruments are more than just the sound they
make. They have a presence and formal aesthetic akin to sculp-
ture, and we take special appreciation of hand devices that convey
an aesthetic through texture, weight, and material such as Han
et. al’s ParaSampling, which allows performers to hold an inter-
face against a rotating magnetic head[5], and Tate et. al’s Hand
Turned Synthesis device that allows one to rotate a crank to make
sound using basic electronics[19].
In many respects, the Aquapella looks like a futuristic tam-
bourine, but it is mostly non-percussive and better geared for
generating ambient backgrounds or "bending" signals. Playful
devices such as the rummaging noise box example in Bower et.
al’s research[3] speak to the ludic background atmospherics we
intend to create with the Aquapella.
2.3 Water based interfaces
Traditionally, water is an unusual medium for music making,
especially in the NIME world where water and electronics go
together like fingernails and chalkboard. However, there is some
indirect precedence in the many liquid-based or underwater de-
vices by Steve Mann that function like woodwinds but use water
instead of air.[11]. Another example is the Symbaline[2], an ac-
tive instrument comprised of several partly-filled wine glasses
excited by electromagnetic coils. The Mocean[ 12] installation
apparatus allows participants to swirl and move water in a tank
and have that translated to sound from pipe organs. Tangible
Sound[21] implemented an installation that modifies sound based
on how a user’s hand shapes the water flow from a faucet to a
drain. More direct, but also abstract, references for our project
are "The Argus Project" and Zack Poff’s "Pond Station" where a
natural body of water serves as a complex resonant space and is
reframed as an instrument in itself[7, 16]. In our case, the body-
of-water-as-instrument is hand held and portable, like an ocean
in a bottle.
2.4 Water and Art
Water is a medium that speaks multiple languages between the
drowning of floods and the calmness of floating. Besides sig-
nalling life, it signals human experience in many invisible di-
mensions. Our project takes inspiration from water based art
works such as those by Anne Hamilton, Joshua Kit Clayton, and
Christina Kubisch that have based art and performances on the
presence or interaction with water. In "Songs of Ascension" by
Meredith Monk at Anne Hamilton’s tower on the Oliver Ranch,
performers and audience members alike act on the long spiral
staircase leading down to a pool of water, reflecting and rever-
berating within the tower all at once [ 13]. Kit Clayton’s 2006
performance at ISEA saw the artist push his own face into a glass
pool of water, recorded from below, as the video component

Aquapella.
of a live AV electronic performance [4]. In Christina Kubisch’s
"Marine Mix", participants walk and move in a large shallow
pool of water in order to hear pre-recorded maritime sounds on
headphones as an experiential mix [8]. While this paper presents
the Aquapella in instrument form, our goal is to develop perfor-
mative situations like the above that speak to larger ecological
issues around water, but within similar artistic frameworks.
3 Project Description
Compared to works cited previously, the Aquapella is unique for
its hand-held, fluid container experience. Sound is generated via
controlling the height of the water at various points around the
container’s perimeter. Moving the container through a gesture
generates chaotic force in the water, and tosses it against the
walls. This turbulent flow, captured by sensing varying water
levels, produces disparate and chaotic sounds through a digital
audio workstation attached via USB.
3.1 Human Interaction
Playing the Aquapella is a tactile experience. Once the Aquapella
is filled with water just below the sensors as seen in Figure 3 (a),
the user can hold it with two hands on either side of the container
and make gestures. These gestures are primarily broken down
into three categories:
(1) Tilting - Tilting the Aquapella in any direction will cause
the water to move towards the side of the container that is
being tilted towards. This movement of water will cause
the sensors on that side of the container to read a higher
water level as scene in Figure 3 (b) and (c).
(2) Swirling - Swirling the Aquapella in a circular motion
will cause the water to move in a circular motion inside of
the container. This motion will cause the water to slide on
the walls of the container through centripetal force and
sequentially activate sensors in a clockwise or counter-
clockwise manner.
(3) Reverberating - Reverberating the Aquapella is taking
advantage of current momentum and motion of water to
bounce water off the walls of the Aquapella. This motion
could be seen as a rapid tilt or circular motion at just the
right speed to keep natural flow of water moving.
Aquapella NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia
While there could be a seemingly infinite amount of gestures
possible with the Aquapella, we gravitated towards these three
as we found they had the best results with our performances.
The Aquapella is designed with a splash guard, but it does not
have a lid. You can’t really shake it or produce wild splashing
within it. This open-top format limits the device to some degree,
but was a design trade-off. In this iteration, we prioritized the
ability to see the water over a fully contained cavity that would
allow wilder, more ecstatic, kinds of water motion.

lateral water movement.

b. Container tilted to the right and the water flows right
c. Container tilted far to the left while the water flows left
reaching the top of the sensor.
3.2 Sensors
Since the height of the water level at various points along the
container’s walls is the control for the sound generation, choosing
an appropriate sensor and ensuring its readings were accurate
was a priority. The primary trade offs to contend with were
form factor, price, accuracy, resolution, and speed. Water level
sensors also vary in methods of measurement, and generally fall
into one of three categories: capacitive sensing, optical sensing,
and conductive sensing. To make the instrument hand-held and
intuitive, we preferred a smaller sensor that could output readings
in real-time (or as close as possible).

merged at different levels and ways.

b. Water level sensor half submerged
c. Water level sensor fully submerged
d. Water level sensor with an askew water level
In our tests of various water level sensors, we found the best
commercial sensor for this iteration proved to be conductive sen-
sors as seen in Figure 4. These sensors are affordable, compact,
low-latency, and intuitive to use, and determine water levels by
measuring the conductance between two nodes on a printed cir-
cuit board (PCB). Since water has a relatively high conductance,
the more the sensor is submerged, the higher the measured value,
allowing it to provide a relative indication of the water level. Nev-
ertheless, the conductive sensors presented several challenges,
including non-linear behavior, water adhesion, and drift.
Electronically, these commercial sensors work by inducing a
small current between two electrodes submerged in water which
biases a bipolar junction transistor (NPN BJT). When only a
small amount of current is biased, the sensors are in active mode,
exhibiting a fairly linear response. However, we observed that
towards the top of the sensor, the voltage response becomes satu-
rated, resulting in a non-linear response to the water level. While
the transistor has an active mode with a linear voltage response,
it also has a saturation mode where the voltage response is loga-
rithmic. A visualization of this voltage response can be seen in
Figure 5. In order to match a performers expectation of a direct
reading from the sensor, we linearised and calibrated the sensors
to map the bottom of the sensor to the top with MIDI values from
0 to 127 for a more intuitive response.
The water’s adhesion – its behavior of clinging to the sensor
surface – often left residue on the sensor, causing it to either
report a false water level or to roll off too slow. We mitigated
these false readings in two ways. First, as a part of the calibration
curve, we added an initial threshold. As seen in Figure 5 the
largest jump in sensed voltage is from water being below the
sensor to barely touching it. By calibrating to this threshold small
droplets of water sticking to the sensor don’t make much of a
difference if the water is not submerged at all. Second, to decrease
overall water adhesion, the printed circuit boards were coated
with silicone spray. This coating encouraged the water to slip off
the sensor without impairing its ability to accurately measure
the water level. Interestingly, compared to control as found in
Figure 5, the silicone coating also increased the voltage response
of the sensor, which made the sensors more effective.
Even with calibration and a silicone coating, these commercial
sensors experienced drift and statistically inconsistent readings.
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Lettang et al.
For instance, when the sensor was submerged at the same water
level for a long time the output value would gradually decrease.
We also found that these sensors seemed to exaggerate quick
readings of water levels, turning a quick splash into an exag-
gerated spike in the sensor readings. While both of these made
true consistency with the instrument impossible, we worked
these known behaviors into how we developed the sound. Future
versions of an Aquapella could utilize other, more customizable
water level sensors to optimize the instrument.

sensor at various heights, showing how different sprayed
materials affect the voltage response.
3.3 The Container
The Aquapella was originally imagined as a permanent instal-
lation where a user would splash the water around in a large
aquarium. During a proof of concept design phase, we veered
away from this instillation mode and towards a hand-held per-
formative mode with more musical intention and variability.
The first prototype of the Aquapella was built in a generic
plastic food container. This rectangular container was easy to
hold and transparent, which made it intuitive to interact with and
fascinating to see under specific lighting conditions. For example,
when lit from above, the clear plastic allowed the audience to see
capillary wave patterns in the light refraction. The rectangular
container made lateral movement of the water between the walls
of the container easy, but performing smooth circular motions
was a challenge.
In our next iteration, we used a shallow circular container that
encouraged cyclical movement with the water (as seen in Figure
7). Ultimately, the short walls meant that this iteration didn’t
hold enough water in the container for the liquid to maintain any
lingering momentum. Also, since the sensors reached the bottom
of the container, the sensors lost a lot of reactivity and never read
neutral. Lastly, the opaque red plastic of the container made the
water more challenging to see and visually uninteresting.
We combined the best from previous designs into a custom,
3D printed, octagonal container. The design features a built-in
housing for the water level sensors, set at a height that allows the
sensors to sit above the resting water line while also accommodat-
ing enough space for the water volume to create reactions in the
sensors. This enables the operator to engage in circular motions
or tilt the water into a specific octant for a higher resolution of
control. The flat walls of the container also made calibration of
the sensors much easier.

rectangular container.
Figure 7: The shallow circular Aquapella prototype.
The octagonal form of the final container of the Aquapella
enables the operator to engage in circular motions, or tilt the
water into a specific octant for a higher resolution of control. The
flat walls of the octagonal Aquapella allow water to "bounce" and
reverberate around the container similar to the rectangular first
iteration of the Aquapella.
3.4 Device Firmware
The Aquapella, in its current state, does not produce sound in-
dependently. Instead, it requires a microcontroller to interpret
and calibrate sensor data, which is then sent as MIDI to an audio
device as seen in Figure 10. We used an Arduino Pro Micro that
supports up to eight analog inputs for sensor measurement and
functions as a generic MIDI device, enabling communication with
any DAW or MIDI-compatible program.
The Pro Micro supports eight channels of analog input, trans-
forming the readings to align with a linearised calibration curve
of MIDI values ranging from 0 to 127. This calibration, which

Figure 9: Mechanical drawing of the Aquapella showing
all sides of the Aquapella.
is hard-coded into the microcontroller, ensures consistent and
normalized readings across all eight sensors. The calibrated data
is transmitted via MIDI as Continuous Controller (CC) values
whenever its respective sensor reads a change. This is similar
to how a MIDI fader device only transmits when it moves posi-
tions. CC MIDI was chosen for its flexibility, allowing users to
map Aquapella’s MIDI data to control parameters such as ampli-
tude, EQ, ambisonics, modulation, or any other MIDI-controllable
feature in a DAW.
In the Aquapella’s current state, the MIDI channels and values
sent by the Aquapella are fixed in the microcontroller’s code
and cannot be changed without reprogramming. However, in
the future, we plan to implement a system to configure MIDI
mappings from an interface on the Aquapella to make it more
adaptable to a variety of performance setups.
3.5 Audio Experiments
As a gestural interface for a computer rather than a stand-alone
sound-producing instrument, the Aquapella offers numerous

tem featuring water level sensors, microcontroller, and
USB camera.
ways to map its movements into sound. While there is still more
to do, we conducted extensive experiments to determine aesthetic
mappings that harmonized the chaotic, natural motion of water
with imagined acoustic outputs. We found that flowing and am-
bient sounds paired best with the Aquapella’s character, leading
us to focus on ambient, noise, and glitch aesthetics that meander
around moments of harmony. For this phase of development, we
focused our experiments on Max/MSP, Pure Data, Strudel, and
Ableton Live, producing sounds in both stereo and quadrophonic
setups.
3.5.1 Spatialization. One natural behavior of the Aquapella is
the tilting and swirling of water within the container. The ini-
tial approach mapped the device’s tilt directly to sound location
within a room. For example, tilting west positioned the sound on
the west side of the room, and tilting north moved it northward.
Since the device lacks elevation detection, spatial mappings were
confined to a 2D plane. This mapping was done by each sensor
having a "weight" that pulled an ambisonic source in its direc-
tion proportionally to its water level. This successfully created
dynamic effects where sounds "reverberated" across the room,
mimicking the water bouncing off the container’s walls.
In other experiments involving spatialization, the sounds were
rotated in space while using tilt to control additional parameters.
For instance, in looping experiments, multichannel Max objects
were employed to pan sound across a quadraphonic setup, using
gestures to modulate dynamics, synthesis, and voice parameters
while the panning occurred in the background. While the panning
was not directly controlled by the user of the Aquapella, it added
an immersive element to the sound.
3.5.2 Octet. The Octet experiment highlights the Aquapella’s
capabilities by assigning each sensor to control the amplitude of
a synthesizer. Gesturing the Aquapella changes the water level of
all sensors and transforms the synthesizers into a flowing octet
controlled by water. When leveraging the water’s cyclical and
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Lettang et al.
reverberating motion, this mapping creates dynamic effects with
any sound source.
The shape of the Octet causes some idiosyncrasies. At rest,
the water level of the Aquapella sits flat just below the sensors
, as in Figure 3(a). However, when tilting around the container
and moving the water slowly, the octagonal form along with the
water depth forces three sensors to be hit with water at the same
time. This effectively means that the Aquapella’s octet is formed
from a series of trios whose volume flowed with the turbulence
of water.
An initial instinct of how to map the pitches of the octet
was to choose eight notes in a scale (repeating the tonic at the
octave), one for each sensor. However, this led to the "trios" of
the octet only being whole steps or half steps apart making an
unpleasantly dissonant cord. In a more successful mapping, we
assigned pitches within a circle of thirds, fourths, and fifths which
spaced out each sequential sensor/note with at least a third. This
mapping allowed for relatively easy programming while also
producing pleasing ambient chords.
We found that the most successful outcome of the octet, how-
ever, was when water was swirled in a cyclical pattern quickly
around the container. This created a flowing circle of notes that
would be extremely reactive to the speed of the circular gesture.
3.5.3 Spaceship. This sound experiment mainly features two
sounds. The first is a rhythmic chirping sound that changes it’s
location in an ambisonic spatialization based on the tilt of the
Aquapella. The chirping was chosen because of how clearly de-
fined the sound is when panned across the room or over head-
phones. The second sound is a theremin-like synthesizer that
changes frequency based on water level across all sensors. This
generally means that the more the water is moved around across
the sensors, the higher the frequency of the theremin sound.
When combined, these sounds create a soundscape that is remi-
niscent of being in an otherworldly spaceship.
3.5.4 Ocean Wind. Ocean Wind is a soundscape featuring white
and pink noise that is transformed with different envelopes to
emulate the sound of an ocean shore. All eight water level sensors
are used to directly control a filter affecting the loudest of the
emulated "ocean wave" adding a low pass filter that makes the
user feel as though they have been submerged in the wave. When
this sound is explored quickly, the white noise emulates more of
a quick gust of wind blowing past the user.
In the background of this soundscape are many quieter sources
of white noise that are constantly oscillating and randomly change
based on the input of the Aquapella. While these sounds are not
directly controlled by the Aquapella, they are in a constant mo-
tion that will always sound different while interacting with the
Aquapella.
3.5.5 Patterns and Euclidean Rhythms. While the Aquapella isn’t
struck like a drum, its tilt and movement lend themselves to
unique interactions that could manipulate percussive sounds.
Experiments with controlling Euclidean rhythms, altering sam-
ple scrubbing speeds and locations, and generating metronome
patterns, achieved varying degrees of success.
We attempted to implement peak detection that would give
timing and velocity to a splash against any of the sensors. The
idea being that rhythmic sounds could be driven by dynamic
splashing water movements in the container. However, with the
sensor’s inconsistencies leading to extremely inconsistent peak
measurements, this experiment proved to be unsuccessful in this
iteration of the Aquapella.
Our best example in generating a rhythmic sound from the
Aquapella featured two percussive sounds with the same rhythm.
The Aquapella would shift the phase of one of these sounds
leading to a completely different final output of rhythm. The
circular shape of the Aquapella lends to an intuitive mapping of
a cyclical concept such as phase shifting.
3.5.6 Voice loopers and Autotune. We also used the Aquapella’s
tilt and motion to modulate vocal and spatial audio. A performer
records their voice either in real-time or through stored buffers
and moves the device to manipulate pitch, shift, and modulation
through gestures. In one setup, a MIDI foot pedal controlled
eight recorded loops, rotating them around the room using Max’s
multichannel objects. Another experiment combined Pure Data
with a microphone and MIDI foot pedal to create heavily auto-
tuned vocal modulations tied to the Aquapella’s movements.
3.6 The Camera
Figure 11: Aquapella camera view with contrast filter.
We built a detachable USB camera mount in the device in order
to experiment with a tightly coupled audio-visual experience. As
the camera is statically fixed to the device, it features the water’s
movement, not the container’s. This USB camera also features a
ring light around the lens that projects a glowing circular orb on
the water’s surface. From the webcam’s perspective (see Figure
11), the ball of light is disrupted with any change to the water’s
surface, and when the water is tilted around the inside of the
Aquapella, the ball of light seems to move with the direction of
tilt.
This provides an interesting synaesthetic dimension that em-
phasizes the connection between visualized water motion and
sound. Our plan is to potentially use two or three Aquapellas
together for a stereo or triadic wide-view display in performance
settings. We may also add physical objects in the water such as
beads or glitter to create analogue VJ’ing capabilities. Addition-
ally, we plan to collaborate with VJ’s who can use the MIDI signal
to modulate the visuals in parallel to sonic activity.
4 Discussion and Future Work
There are a few points of discussion we’d like to highlight regard-
ing the Aquapella that focus on the use of liquid turbulence in
Aquapella NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia

its own USB cable separate to the microcontroller.
sound making, the combination of physical and computational
media, gestural audio interfaces based on water, and performance.
4.1 Liquid Turbulence and Sound
The Aquapella demonstrates a novel way to interact with fluid
dynamics through sound, offering a tactile yet flowing medium
of engagement. Unlike fully contained and controlled hydraulic
systems, the Aquapella embraces the inherent unpredictability of
water while monitoring it in detail. This balance between control
and chaos makes the device uniquely interactive, capturing the
erratic nature of water and translating it into a form that can be
intuitively understood and experienced through sound.
4.2 Combination of Physical and
Computational Media
The Aquapella exemplifies the synergy between physical and
computational interactions. Physical interactions are inherently
engaging, but challenging to quantify and interpret in real time.
Computational interactions offer vast possibilities, but often lack
a tangible, kinaesthetic quality. By merging these two media,
the Aquapella augments interaction with the physical world
while grounding the experience in the digital realm. This fusion
enhances both the intuitive understanding of fluid dynamics and
the creative potential of digital sound design.
4.3 Liquids as a Gestural Audio Interface
The novelty of this research lies in using water as a gestural
interface where the device’s direct motion leads to indirect and
dynamic acoustic outcomes. Nearly identical inputs generate
unique outputs due to the chaotic nature of the water. Further-
more, the Aquapella’s gestures are contextually dependent and
driven by flow. The momentum of water carries over from one
gesture to the next, creating sustained effects. This residual mo-
mentum introduces an "aftertouch"-like quality, where the physi-
cal properties of water extend and transform the sonic output in
nuanced ways.
Interestingly, we found that most people who used the Aquapella
for the first time had an intuitive understanding of the capabili-
ties of the device. While this needs more research, it suggests that
people have a natural understanding of how to interact with wa-
ter in a container and different ways that water is moved through
gesturing with the container. This is perhaps because people
interact with containers of fluid on a daily basis and turning one
into an instrument is a natural extension of that interaction.
4.4 Performance with the Aquapella
Performing with the Aquapella has some challenges due to its
inherent inconsistency. Distinguishing between inconsistencies
caused by the water’s chaotic nature and those resulting from
calibration issues proved difficult. This variability can make pre-
cise musical performance challenging, particularly for artists
seeking consistent outputs. However, embracing the fluid and
unpredictable nature of the Aquapella opens up endless creative
possibilities. For performers, the sensation of feeling the water’s
weight shift within the container, while simultaneously hearing
the corresponding sound move through the room, is uniquely
satisfying.
The Aquapella also offers immense audio-visual potential. The
mounted camera provides a visual representation of the water’s
movement, allowing the audience to share in the fascination of
elemental dynamics and observe how gestures shape the chaotic
fluid into expressive soundscapes.
4.5 Future Work
In future work, we want to explore custom sensors, use in ed-
ucation, various container shapes, feedback systems, new peak
detection, chemical changes, and future performance concepts.
4.5.1 Custom Sensors. The commercial sensors, while sufficient
for the current system, present a limitation in terms of accuracy,
durability, and adaptability. We believe we can custom build more
robust and accurate sensors that are tailored to the Aquapella’s
needs. Custom sensors offer greater precision, longer lifespan,
and flexible form factors, opening up possibilities for further iter-
ative changes and enhancements to the device. While our current
sensors are based on conductance, we are interested in exploring
capacitive sensors where integrated circuits could be used with
exposed wire in the water, copper plates that measure water level
from the outside, or conductive 3D printed filament. Capacitive
sensors would likely prove to be less finicky and require less
calibration than the conductive sensors we are currently using
4.5.2 Container Shapes. The shape of the container significantly
influences the personality of the instrument and its gestural in-
teractions. Future iterations could explore a variety of container
shapes to expand the range of possible gestures and sounds. For
example, long containers like tubes or gutters could function as
low-frequency oscillators (LFOs), while fully enclosed spherical
containers could enable dynamic performances, such as hold-
ing and moving the device while dancing. Pendulum-mounted
containers could add another layer of motion-based sound ma-
nipulation. A collection of diverse container shapes could also
create versatile and visually captivating performance setups.
4.5.3 Feedback Systems. Incorporating auditory and visual feed-
back into the Aquapella could greatly enhance its interactivity
and aesthetics. For instance, an underwater speaker could pro-
duce waves of sound within the water, creating a feedback loop
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Lettang et al.
where the instrument responds to its own output. Similarly, in-
tegrating LEDs that change based on sensor readings or visual
inputs from the camera could add a dynamic glitch aesthetic to
the visuals. These feedback systems could deepen the performer’s
connection with the instrument and provide audiences with a
more immersive experience.
4.5.4 Peak Detection. We have implemented a peak detection
feature in the Aquapella’s hardware that sends MIDI note-on
and note-off commands based on detected peaks in the sensor
readings. This allows the Aquapella to function as a traditional
MIDI instrument, capable of interfacing with other electronic
MIDI instruments.
When a sensor detects a significant peak, the Pro Micro sends
a note-on command with the peak value as the velocity. Once
the sensor reading falls below a certain threshold, a note-off
command is sent. This enables the Aquapella to work with MIDI
instruments and samplers that have their own ADSR envelopes.
While this mode abstracts the flowing nature of water, it al-
lows for more traditional MIDI interactions. However, we aim
to refine this functionality as the current peak detection algo-
rithm does not feel very responsive. We believe that improving
the algorithmic detection of peaks and allowing the Aquapella
to change MIDI notes without reprogramming the device will
enhance its performance.
4.5.5 Chemical Changes. Experimenting with liquids other than
water or chemically altering the liquid mid-performance could
introduce new dimensions of interaction and sound generation.
Adding salt could increase conductivity, cornstarch could change
viscosity, and colored oils could add visual richness. These changes
could be dynamically reflected in the instrument’s output, allow-
ing performers to explore a broader range of auditory and visual
effects.
4.5.6 Future Performance Concepts. The Aquapella lends itself to
exploring water in various social, aesthetic, and physical contexts.
We imagine future performances with the instrument to explore
psychological or political themes around water. For instance, one
interest of ours is something known as the Diving Reflex which
describes a series of physiological changes that occur when an air-
breathing vertebrate holds its breath underwater. As an example,
when a person submerges their face in water, their heart rate
slows down immediately. We are also interested in developing
compositions that address water rights and conservation.
4.5.7 Education. While designed as a performance instrument,
the Aquapella also has educational applications. Its interactive
nature could serve as a tool for teaching physics concepts such as
acoustics, resonance, and wave dynamics. By engaging with these
principles through sound and movement, students could develop
a more intuitive understanding of complex physical phenomena.
4.5.8 User Study. At this time, no formal evaluation has been
conducted with the Aquapella. We have only conducted informal
user studies to help gauge the general usability of the device. In
the future, we plan to conduct a more formal study with a variety
of musicians and user groups to assess the expressiveness and
capabilities of the Aquapella in a variety of hands and scenarios.
5 Conclusion
The development of the Aquapella, a water-inspired gestural
device for musical expression, showcases the innovative intersec-
tion of chaotic physics and digital art in musical performances.
This novel instrument harnesses liquid turbulence to generate
dynamic soundscapes, offering a unique perspective on the in-
terplay between liquid motion and sound. By leveraging compu-
tational technology to report the real-time state of a liquid to a
digital audio workstation, the Aquapella creates opportunities for
exploring this relationship in ways that were previously difficult
or less-direct.
While more conventional methods exist for capturing ges-
tures and translating them into sound, the Aquapella provides
a distinct, tangible, and kinaesthetic experience. It bridges the
physical and auditory worlds, allowing users to manipulate and
interact with both in a deeply kinaesthetic way.
Future applications of the Aquapella lie in innovative perfor-
mances that study the complex relationship between gesture,
turbulence, and music. These explorations could further uncover
the potential of this instrument as both an artistic and educational
tool. Additionally, experimenting in custom sensors, container
shapes, feedback systems, and chemical changes could signifi-
cantly enhance the Aquapella’s capabilities, making it a versatile
and powerful instrument for a wide range of creative applica-
tions.
