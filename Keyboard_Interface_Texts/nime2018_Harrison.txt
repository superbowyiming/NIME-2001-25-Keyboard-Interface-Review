ABSTRACT
The design of traditional musical instruments is a process
of incremental reﬁnement over many centuries of innova-
tion. As a result, the shape and form of instruments are
well established and recognised across cultures. Conversely,
digital musical instruments (DMIs), being unconstrained by
requirements of eﬃcient acoustic sound production and er-
gonomics, can take on forms which are more abstract in
their relation to the mechanism of control and sound pro-
duction. In this paper we consider the case of designing
DMIs that resemble traditional instruments, and pose ques-
tions around the social and technical acceptability of certain
design choices relating to physical form and input modal-
ity (sensing strategy and the input gestures that it aﬀords).
We designed four guitar-derivative DMIs to be suitable for
performing strummed harmonic accompaniments to a folk
tune. Each instrument possesses a combination of one of
two global forms (guitar-like body and a smaller tabletop
enclosure) and one of two control mechanisms (physical
strings and touch sensors). We conducted a study where
both non-musicians and guitarists played two versions of
the instruments and completed musical tasks with each in-
strument. This study highlights the complex interaction
between global form and input modality when designing for
existing musical cultures and varying levels of expertise.

1. INTRODUCTION
Within the NIME community ‘instrument-like’ controllers,
or DMIs that resemble traditional instruments, have been a
persistently popular area of exploration [29]. Similar trends
can also be seen in the commercial world where many novel
instruments and controllers resemble traditional instruments
[22]. It is often suggested that a reason for this focused en-
ergy is that it allows the re-use of playing techniques from
traditional instruments and hence oﬀers a route to faster

uptake. However this viewpoint leaves out important fac-
tors related to an instrument’s social acceptability, and we
should ask ourselves whether the popularity of DMIs emu-
lating traditional instruments comes more from their control
characteristics or from their physical form.
Therefore there is a question of what it means to be
‘instrument-like’: does it mean sharing interaction modal-
ities or does it mean having the cultural appearance that
stands in for a traditional instrument? In this study we
sought to disambiguate the two by deliberately testing con-
gruent and incongruent pairings of design cues of a guitar-
like DMI. We designed four instruments which mix and
match from two physical forms (guitar shaped and tabletop)
and two interaction modalities (strings and touch sensor),
seen in Figure 1. Every participant played two of the four
instruments, either a congruent or incongruent pair. Our
particular interest is in the incongruent case where peo-
ple have to choose between something which preserves ei-
ther the interaction modality or physical form. Our aim
was to interrogate which design cues made the DMI more
instrument-like and more enjoyable to play: physical form
or interaction modality.
2. RELATED WORK
Of primary importance to the design of digital musical in-
struments (DMIs) are the techniques used to capture the
movement of a performer, namely, the sensing strategy [23],
and how this is mapped to a sound engine [13]. Increasing
importance is being given to the physical form and tangi-
ble qualities of an instrument which carry cultural conno-
tations that inﬂuence the musical gestural language a per-
former uses [2]. Essl and O’Modhrain [10] introduce the
enactive approach to instrument design as a means of pre-
serving the coupling between sensorimotor perception and
our understanding of the physical properties of tangible ob-
jects. By utilising ‘familiar sensorimotor experiences’ map-
ping can become less of a digital question and more of a
physical one. Many of the physical aspects of DMIs are
deﬁned by the demands of the sensing strategy but stud-
ies into the inﬂuence of physical form in instrument design
have demonstrated how simple modiﬁcations to the mate-
rial, form and dynamic behaviour of an input device can
have great implications for how a performer interacts with
an instrument [18, 6]. In this paper, we discuss a group of
DMIs which embody aspects of the enactive approach, al-
lowing us to explore similar concepts of sensorimotor famil-
iarity, by utilising two sensor topologies designed explicitly
for strummed or plucked string instrument performances.
2.1 Technical Role of Instruments
Baily [1] proposes acoustic musical instruments as move-
ment transducers: as the performer makes contact with the
‘active surface’ of the instrument it converts patterns of
299
body movement into patterns of sound. Acoustic instru-
ment design focuses on how this transduction takes place
by shaping how the performer’s body ﬁts to the instrument,
and how the mechanism eﬃciently converts this into sound.
Dobrian and Koppelman [9] emphasise the importance of
relating DMI design to its acoustic ancestry as an exam-
ple of a relationship between gesture and sound is at once
intuitive and complex.
With DMIs the translation of action to sound is not di-
rect but rather relies on a complex chain of mediation -
the sensors involved in capturing movement and the type of
movement that the sensor encourages, the rate and ﬁdelity
at which movement is captured, the mapping of this reduced
representation of movement to sound parameters, and the
quality of the sound generation and its reﬂection of the per-
formers’ movements. Control intimacy is a concept intro-
duced by Moore [24], and further explored by Wessel and
Wright [30], as a means of talking about the richness of this
translation of movement to sound. Acoustic instruments of-
ten display high control intimacy: instruments such as the
voice, violin, sitar, allow the micro-gestural movements of
the performer to create a wide range of aﬀective variation of
musical sound, whereas with DMIs this is highly dependent
on design choices.
In DMI design relating control strategies to those of acous-
tic instruments can be a method of leveraging existing ex-
pertise, although exactly which design elements are respon-
sible for this remains unclear: as Cook points out “copy-
ing an instrument is dumb; leveraging expert technique is
smart” [8]. Approaches to this have included preserving a
sense of energy transfer in digital system of an instrument
[20] and building upon everyday tangible interactions [10].
2.2 Social Role of Instruments
In his theorisation of tangible user interfaces Horn points
out that the evocation of cultural forms can tap into users’
existing cognitive, physical and emotional resources, acti-
vating existing forms of social activity [12]. For Rojas, as
a performer becomes acquainted with a particular musical
instrument they gain an understanding of a musical topo-
graphical space that maps out, not only the coupling of ac-
tion and sound, but also how the engagement of performer
and instrument relates to aesthetic, ecological, and techno-
logical threads contained within the instrument’s structure
[26]. This understanding echoes Small’s notion of ‘musick-
ing’ [27] which deﬁnes music as something that we ‘do’: an
activity that is surrounded by a set of strict behavioural
laws that are imposed on both performers and perceivers.
Much ethnomusicology is dedicated to the study of the cul-
tural speciﬁcity and importance of musical practices, and
how they relate to these behavioural laws. A particularly
relevant example comes from Bates who, when reﬂecting on
the materiality of musical instruments, oﬀers the following
statement on the social life of musical instruments:
Much of the power, mystique, and allure of mu-
sical instruments [...] is inextricable from the
myriad situations where instruments are entan-
gled in webs of complex relationships between
humans and objects, between humans and hu-
mans, and between objects and other objects.
Bates [2, p. 364]
Bijsterveld and Schulp [7] discuss tensions surrounding
innovation in traditional instruments, through discussions
with instrument manufacturers who have employed inno-
vative approaches in their designs. A key example is the
Pellegrina viola, a radical redesign of the traditional form

wise from top left: Strings-Guitar (SG), Strings-

allowing performers to access higher positions on the neck
without risk of injury or discomfort. The Pellegrina’s strik-
ing, asymmetrical shape led to initial shock amongst other
orchestra players and garnered substantial press attention.
Lubet [19] cites the ‘highly standardized’ performance re-
quirements of classical musicians as a disabling factor for
musicians with impairments, but also acknowledges that
disability status can shift across musical cultures: an ex-
ample being Django Reinhardt, whose impaired left hand
would prevent him from performing classical guitar pieces,
but who nonetheless became a highly proﬁcient jazz soloist.
Benford [5] refers to the ‘social demands of musical eti-
quette’ when describing the aversion to technology during
folk sessions in Irish pubs. Despite the ubiquity of technol-
ogy during the preparation for the sessions (predominantly
the use of the web and social networks), members upheld
an appearance of tradition by eschewing technology during
the sessions themselves. Bell [3] posits the guitar’s ‘high
value in cultural capital’ as a factor in the explosion of Gui-
tar Hero games during the previous decade, suggesting that
such games allow entry into a ‘musical experience that is
enmeshed in popular culture’. Bell also cites the guitar’s
cultural value as a compelling argument for improving the
accessibility of the guitar and its associated pedagogy to
disabled musicians and beginners, an argument that is re-
inforced in the design philosophy of the KellyCaster 1, de-
signed by John Kelly, a musician with access needs, and
Drake Music2. The requirement for an instrument that car-
ries the same cultural weight (not to mention interaction
techniques) as a guitar was paramount in its design.

factors relating to guitar playing. We also aimed to dis-
cover whether musicianship and familiarity with the guitar
would inﬂuence participants’ reasoning and playing tech-
niques. The musical tasks described below relate to the
speciﬁc focus of this paper. A secondary aim of this study
was to look in more detail at the behaviour of the stringed
instruments, the results of which are presented elsewhere
[15].
3.1 Instrument design
We developed four guitar-derivative DMIs with varying com-
binations of overall form (guitar-shaped vs. tabletop) and
interaction modality (plucked strings vs. touch sensor).
The resulting instruments can been seen in Figure 1 and
are herein referred to as SG (Strings-Guitar), ST (Strings-
Tabletop), TT (Touch-Tabletop) and TG (Touch-Guitar).
Our intention was to create a series of ‘technology probes’
[14] which were created in order to serve three goals: the
social science goal of understanding the needs and desires
of users in a real-world setting, the engineering goal of ﬁeld-
testing the probe, and the design goal of provoking users to
reﬂect on their interaction with the probe. In relation to
musical instruments this is an approach that has identiﬁed
interesting behavioural patterns in previous studies [11, 16].
3.2 Physical construction
A single enclosure for the ‘Guitar’ instrument was com-
missioned for this study. The enclosure is constructed out
of hardwood with a sculpted neck with six push-buttons
roughly at the position of the lower frets. The buttons are
arranged in two rows of three, set to chords I, IV and V in
the key of G on the top row, with their relative minors on
the row below. The body is hollow, allowing the sensor(s)
to be swapped between the string modules or touch sensor.
We designed two similar enclosures for the tabletop in-
struments, which were intended to reﬂect design cues from
boutique tabletop music hardware, such as modular synth
controllers. The push-buttons were placed in the lower left-
hand corner, with the strumming area placed at a 45 de-
gree angle, which was found to be a comfortable method of
strumming on a tabletop.
The string instruments feature six short lengths of .040
gauge bass guitar string held over a ‘strummable area’ of
about 10 cm. At one end, the strings are terminated over a
block of felt-covered foam, with six individual bridge-pieces
at the other with integrated piezo disc sensors, and held to
a low tension using adjustable zither pins. This provides a
signal similar to the attack of a guitar string when plucked.
The thick strings and low tension produce a short decay and
fewer resonant properties than a typical guitar string.
The touch instruments use a capacitive touch slider de-
rived from the TouchKeys keyboard overlay design [21] to
detect ﬁnger position. Six ‘string areas’ are equally spaced
along the sensor. We applied several layers of paint in thin
strips to the surface of the sensor, to provide tactile cues as
to the location of each string area. We chose this type of
sensor for its ‘swiping’ and ‘tapping’ aﬀordances - gestures
commonly associated with touchscreen interfaces but which
have a direct analogy to strumming and ﬁnger-picking.
We used an implementation of the Karplus-Strong plucked
string algorithm [17] to simulate six virtual strings which are
excited in real time using signals from the piezo and touch
sensors. An excitation waveform was recorded by plucking
one of the strings and recording the audio signal directly
from the piezo. For the string instruments, a peak-detection
algorithm is used to detect peaks in the amplitude of the
piezo sensors output, and trigger the excitation waveform
each time a peak is reached. For the touch sensor, the ex-
citation waveform is triggered when one of the six string
areas is tapped or swiped across.
3.3 Study design
We recruited 32 participants: 16 ‘competent’ guitarists, and
16 non-musicians. Participants were asked to self-identify at
the recruitment stage using the following statements: ‘you
are comfortable strumming and playing along to a tune’
(competent guitarists) and ‘you have no or very little ex-
perience playing an instrument’ (non-musicians). In or-
der to account for within-group variability in musical skill,
we asked participants to complete the self-report question-
naire section of the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication In-
dex (GoldMSI) test battery [25].
Participants were given one of two combinations of in-
struments, either the congruent pair SG-TT (Strings-Guitar
and Touch-Tabletop) or the incongruent pair ST-TG (Strings-
Tabletop and Touch-Guitar). An equal number of guitarists
and non-musicians were given each combination, resulting
in four groups of 8 under test. Within each group, the order
of presentation of the two instruments was reversed for half
the participants.
3.3.1 Musical tasks
The participants were presented with the ﬁrst instrument
without seeing the second. They were asked to improvise
and explore with the instrument for 7 minutes. They were
then given a further 7 minutes to rehearse and perform an
accompaniment to a record of a folk song performed on ﬁd-
dle and electric bass. We chose folk for this study due to
the role of fretted string instruments as rhythmic harmonic
accompaniments which are often strummed, allowing for a
relatively accessible musical task to be set up, as well as to
provide some cultural context to the task. We recorded a
piece taken from the folk-RNN songbook [28] for this pur-
pose. The recording had added percussion to allow partic-
ipants to follow the beat. The chord structure of the song
used chords I, IV and V in the key of G. We added coloured
stickers to the buttons to indicate these chords and printed
a colour-coded score for participants to follow while playing.
We also produced a video ﬁle displaying the chord colours
and positions on screen as they appeared in the score, in a
similar manner to the Guitar Hero games. Participants were
allowed to use either or both of these methods to follow the
backing track but were encouraged to use the printed score
if they felt comfortable to do so. The buttons and score are
presented in Figure 2. Both the improvisation and score-
following tasks were repeated with the second instrument.

3.3.2 Structured interview and questionnaire
Following the musical tasks, we asked participants to ﬁll
out an on-screen questionnaire, providing ratings for each
instrument on factors split into technical, social, and general
preference subgroups. The questionnaire and results are
presented in Section 4.2. Following the questionnaire, we

conducted structured interviews with questions relating to
techniques used with each instrument, and general thoughts
on their experiences with the instrument.
4. FINDINGS
We shall now report the ratings given by each participant
group in relation to the instrument pairs and summarise the
reports from the structured interviews.
4.1 Participant data
19 participants were male (13 guitarists and 6 non-musicians),
and 13 were female (3 guitarists and 10 non-musicians).
Participant age ranged from 18 to 62 with an average 32
years old. The average GoldMSI score for each group were
89 (SD = 11, minimum = 72) for guitarists and 55 (SD =
11, maximum = 70) for non-musicians.
4.2 Ratings
Figure 3 displays participants’ questionnaire responses, which
indicate preference for either instrument. We have divided
the questions into those that relate to technical factors (ease
of use, naturalness of playing, responsiveness, and proﬁ-
ciency with the instrument), social factors (preference for
playing in diﬀerent environments, similarity to a guitar,
how the sound met expectations) and general preference
(how fun each instrument was to play, overall preference).
These results are summarised as follows (unless otherwise
stated, responses were given by placing a continuous slider
on a horizontal plane, with ‘Instrument 1’ on the left and
‘Instrument 2’ on the right):
Technical
•Which instrument was easier to play?whereas
on average the non-musicians rated TG as easier to
play in comparison to ST, guitarists varied in their
responses for this pair. For the SG-TT pair guitarists
rated the SG as easier to play, with the non-musicians
showing no preference for this combination.
•Which instrument allowed you to play in the
most natural way?Guitarists strongly rated strings
as more natural on average, non-musicians diﬀered in
their response. No noticeable eﬀect of global form.
•Which instrument was most responsive to your
style of playing?Guitarists rate string more respon-
sive in both pairs, non-musicians diﬀered in response.
•How well did you play the accompaniment on
each instrument?(Two 5-point likert scale normalised
to 0-100 by making 0 indicate performance is better on
instrument 1, 100 indicate performance is better on
instrument 2 and 50 represent an equal rating)Gui-
tarists rated themselves as playing much better on SG
and ST, non-musicians are undecided.
Social
•Which instrument would you prefer to play
at home? Guitarists generally prefer strings, non-
musicians tend towards the guitar form.
•Which instrument could you imagine playing in
a folk session?Both groups strongly prefer the SG in
comparison to TT. For the ST-TG combination non-
musicians preferred ST, Guitarists split in opinion.
•Which instrument was most similar to a gui-
tar? In the case of SG-TT there is strong agreement
between groups that SG is more similar. In the case
of ST-TG both groups do not reach an agreement.
•Did the instrument sound like you expected?
(Two 5-point likert scale normalised to 0-100 by mak-
ing 0 indicate instrument 1 is more expected, 100 in-
dicate instrument 2 is more expected, and 50 repre-
senting an equal rating)In the case of SG-TT the SG
meets expectations of both groups. In the case of ST-
TG neither groups display a preference.
General
•Which instrument was more fun to play?No
agreement between guitarists, non-musicians rate touch
sensor as more fun to play in both combinations.
•Which instrument did you prefer to play?Non-
musicians prefer the guitar form. No agreement be-
tween the guitarists, wide variation on a participant
by participant basis regardless of group.
4.2.1 Trends across all participants
To further cluster the responses of all the participants into
related groups we performed a principal component factor
analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation (Kaiser Normalisa-
tion). Two components with an eigenvalue greater than 1.0
were found (the component loadings are shown in Table 1).
Component 1 includes the factors related to the partic-
ipants’ reported enjoyment and preference for a particular
instrument. Component 2includes factors relating to the
instrument’s playability and relationship to a guitar.
4.2.2 Structured interviews
The structured interviews were transcribed and the responses
thematised using thematic analysis. We present in Table 2
paraphrased quotes from both groups in relation to the in-
congruent pair ST-TG, organised into the key themes that
emerged from the thematic analysis. Additional quotes are
employed in the discussion.

5. DISCUSSION
Results from the questionnaire show the eﬀects of the con-
gruent vs. incongruent pairings as they relate to form and
input modality. The SG-TT combination represents a con-
gruent relationship: it is clear what the guitar form with
strummable strings is designed to do and this was reﬂected
in both groups rating of ‘guitar-likeness’ and their com-
ments. The ST-TG combination introduces an incongru-
ence between form and modality. The result was that par-
ticipants were less clear on which was more guitar-like. In
general for this pairing we saw a greater diﬀerence between
the two participant groups: non-musicians gave higher rat-
ings to the TG instrument, which shared the physical form
of a guitar but lacked strings, whereas guitarists gave higher
ratings to the ST instrument that had physical strings but
a compact tabletop form. An exception was the ‘folk ses-
sion’ rating, for which non-musicians tended towards the
ST instrument.
5.1 Input modality
In general, trends related to input modality concerned sens-
ing strategy and the reinforcement of the participant’s con-
trol through the physicality of the input device.
Guitarists: This group generally gave higher ratings to
the stringed versions of the instruments regardless of the
global form. From the structured interviews there were re-
ports of the strings feeling more natural to play and allowing
the use of existing techniques that they had from the guitar.
The tactility of the strings was mentioned as an important
factor as this provided a physical support for their gestures.
Criticisms of the touch sensor from this group repeatedly
focused on the lack of an anchor, or reference point that
would tell them where their hand was positioned. Their
hands would often drift away from the sensing area if they
were not visually monitoring it.
Non-musicians: There were diverse reports of preference
from this group with a relatively even split between the two
input modalities. Many in this group commented positively
on the presence of the strings mentioning that when they
saw the strings they knew what to do, whereas with the
sensor it was less clear what gesture was expected.
For the string instruments there was an increase in un-
conventional techniques reported in the structured inter-
view (tapping on bridge pieces, tapping and pushing down
stings, ﬂat rolling of ﬁngers to trigger strings). This group
was more inventive in their interpretation of the strings than
the guitarists. The touch sensor input modality was rated
as more fun to play than the strings by the non-musicians
regardless of global form. This suggests that the novelty of
this interaction could have advantages with this group.
The diﬀerence between the groups highlights an interest-
ing point about design that echoes Benford et al.’s expected,
sensed, desired framework [4]. There are often gestures that
fall outside of the category of expected and desired yet are
chosen by participants due to their eﬃciency in producing
sound. Although the strings represent a certain canon of
musical gesture this is easily completely side-stepped when
the performer has no knowledge of this canon.
The strings input modality also seemed to act as a strong
social cue: the tabletop instrument with strings was still
compared to a guitar, preferred for folk performance and
reported as more natural. This suggests that the strings
are strongly associated with ‘authentic’ guitar performances
even when global form is radically diﬀerent.
5.2 Physical form
The social aspects at play that are inﬂuenced by the phys-
ical form are complex and varied with each individual and
their experience, but we observed some interesting trends:
Guitarists: In the ST-TG pairing we still observed gui-
tarists siding with the string version of the instrument re-
gardless of global form. This held across the majority of
the quality ratings aside from guitar-likeness and suitabil-
ity for a folk session, where there was no consensus in the
group. Perhaps this suggests that the guitarists consider
a guitar-like instrument to be most socially acceptable in
a folk context, but do not agree which instrument is in-
deed most guitar-like. Two guitarists in the ST-TG group
reported preferring the TG to ST: the ergonomics of the
guitar form, in terms of positioning of the right hand and
being able to hold the instrument like a guitar, were given
as reasons. Their solution with the ST instrument was to
lift it up or place it on their lap to make it easier to play.
Non-musicians: Global form had more of an inﬂuence
on this group than the guitarists. In the case of the ST-TG
instrument pairing the guitar form was generally preferred.
This could suggest that this group placed importance on
embodying the gestural language of guitar playing.
We attempted to treat global form and input modality as
separable concepts, however in practice this is not neces-
sarily the case. Each input modality has their own visual
cues which contribute to perceived social acceptability. The
stringed instruments were more readily accepted as a folk
instrument, while the touch sensor elicited comparisons to
game controllers and MIDI devices. The results in Table
1 reﬂect this: while the relationship between factors for
component 1 is clear (‘play at home’, ‘preference to play’,
‘fun to play’ and ‘ease of use’ relate to overall enjoyment of
playing the instrument, regardless of social acceptability),
component 2 contains factors relating to both social cues
(‘play at a folk session’ and ‘guitar likeness’) and techni-
cal (‘responsiveness’ and ‘naturalness’). Perhaps a common
theme amongst these factors is the ‘instrument-like’ qual-
303
ities of the instrument, which have less to do with over-
all enjoyment but might relate to a perceived authenticity.
In terms of designing new DMIs for existing musical cul-
tures, an authentic instrument might be described as one
which encompasses both the ‘macro-level’ social cues and
the ‘micro-level’ interaction of existing instruments.
6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper we have tried to address the following question:
which is more important to a performer’s impression of an
instrument, global form or input modality? Whilst agree-
ment amongst all participants was strong for the ‘congruent’
strings guitar and touch sensor tabletop group, there was
less parity across and between groups for the ‘incongruent’
touch sensor guitar and strings tabletop group. The re-
sults hint at a preference for the technical familiarity of the
stringed instrument amongst the guitarists. Non-musicians
tended to prefer the touch guitar instrument, which could
be due to the relative ease of use of the touch sensor, or the
‘cultural load’ of the guitar form.
