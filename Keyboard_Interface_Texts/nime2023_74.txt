ABSTRACT
This paper introduces the T-Patch, a software application
that streamlines the use of T-Stick Digital Musical Instru-
ments (DMIs). It offers a user-friendly interface for gesture
extraction, mapping, signal conditioning, sound synthesis,
and sequencing with cues, enabling composers to create mu-
sic without programming, therefore lowering the entry fee
associated with the use of the T-Stick. Our main contri-
bution is two-fold: (1) providing a versatile software solu-
tion to address the current lack of music-making support
for T-Stick DMI, and (2) highlighting the importance of
demonstration content, such as a video, to showcase the in-
strument’s capabilities and inspire new users. The T-Patch
provides an accessible and friendly way for using the T-
Stick, while offering a shared software solution for various
music-making scenarios.

1. INTRODUCTION
Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) [9] have the poten-
tial to revolutionize the way we create and perform mu-
sic, but the longevity of these instruments is often uncer-
tain. The lack of performers and technical issues can make
these instruments disappear quickly. Ferguson and Wander-
ley claim that “The current scene is peppered with unique
and fascinating digital instruments with a performer base
of one” [2]. McPherson and Kim have identified the prob-
lem of the “second performer,” in which a new instrument
becomes extinct as its inventor/designer stops using it [10].
Adnan and Juan suggest that the prolonged use of a DMI
can be achieved through musical pedagogy that focuses on
both the development of the instrument/interface and its

use in musical performance [7]. Fukuda et al. argue that
the existence of compositions that are idiomatic to a new
instrument is crucial in achieving its long-term usage [3].
These statements highlight that the generation of reper-
toires through widespread usage of the new instrument is
critical in achieving instrument longevity. An important
part of the issue is the substantial barrier faced by one will-
ing to start using DMIs, as formalized by Wessel and Wright
when mentioning the need for a “low entry fee with no ceil-
ing in virtuosity”, stated another way: “Getting started with
a computer-based instrument should be relatively easy but
this early stage ease-of-use should not stand in the way of
the continued development of musical expressivity” [12].
To address these challenges, the T-Stick Music Creation
Project (TMCP) was launched. The project includes work-
shops, mentorship, and technical support to help participat-
ing composers generate new compositions for the sopranino
T-Stick DMI—a cylindrical musical interface that includes
a 9-DoF inertial measurement unit (IMU), Force-Sensing
Resistors (FSR), capacitive sensors and a tact push button,
shown in Figure 1. While TMCP has succeeded in generat-
ing five new works for the T-Stick, it has also revealed the
need for a dedicated software application that allows com-
posers to easily try various playing techniques to generate
sounds [3].
Figure 1: Sopranino T-Sticks.
The T-Patch is an educational software application that
addresses the problem of the lack of a software applica-
tion. Providing non-technical users with functionalities for
receiving OSC data from the T-Stick, gesture extraction,
mapping, signal conditioning, sound synthesis, sequencing
with cues, and GUI, this application aims to lower the en-
trance effort for using T-Sticks and welcomes novice users
such as composers who have minimal computer program-
ming skills.
The paper is organized as follows: first, we present our
motivation, followed by a description of the design and im-
plementation of the T-Patch. Second, we introduce our
early observations on user experience, and our findings and
implications. Finally, we discuss limitations and future work.
2. MOTIV ATION
The T-Stick is a family of gestural controller interfaces that
utilizes various sensors [6]. These interfaces allow musi-
cians and composers to control sound and music generation
through physical gestures, making them a powerful tool for
creative expression. However, despite a robust communal
effort to ease the use of this DMI such as embedding ges-
ture extraction algorithms into its firmware [8], there is still
an obstacle for users who have minimum technological ex-
pertise in programming: the lack of dedicated software ap-
plication allowing for immediate use of the interface. The
conventional T-Stick package includes a simple diagnostic
Pure Data patch that displays the data from the T-Stick
interface without any sound generation capabilities.
This limitation presents a challenge for composers who
are not proficient in programming, as there is a lack of a
universal and shared software implementation that allows
composers to try playing techniques to generate sounds. In
the past, composers such as Stewart [11] have addressed this
issue by developing patches customized specifically for their
compositions. However, this approach is not feasible for
composers with limited programming skills. To fully lever-
age the creativity of composers with minimum technological
skills in an educational context, and to overcome this ob-
stacle, we have developed the T-Patch application. Its goal
is to make the T-Stick more accessible and user-friendly for
composers and musicians of all skill levels, and to contribute
to the longevity and widespread use of the T-Stick.
3. DESIGN
The design of the T-Patch strikes a balance between flex-
ibility and usability for composers with limited technical
expertise. We acknowledge that high flexibility in software
can often lead to a complex design and a steep learning
curve for users. To address this challenge, we have devel-
oped a GUI-based software for T-Stick. Users can simply
set parameters to achieve their desired output without the
need for programming, allowing for ease of use and minimal
effort to get started.
Figure 2: GUI of the T-Patch main window
The T-Patch offers a comprehensive set of functionalities
that allow users to easily create and perform music with the
T-Stick. These functionalities include OSC receiver, gesture
extraction, signal conditioning, mapping, sound synthesis,
and sequencing.
3.1 OSC receiver
The OSC receiver functionality receives and processes OSC
data [13] from the T-Stick. The T-Stick sends sensor and
gesture data in OSC format, which the OSC receiver con-
verts into usable data. The receiver’s GUI allows users to
set the T-Stick model number and port number.
Figure 3: GUI for the OSC receiver
3.2 Improved Gesture extraction
The gesture extraction functionality detects the “jab” ges-
ture, which is a common and important gesture for com-
posers such as [11]. The current T-Stick firmware already
detects several gestures such as “touch” “rub” “brush” and
“shake” from the raw sensor data, however, the “jab” ges-
ture detection algorithm has not yet been embedded. By
including this feature in the T-Patch, composers can take
full advantage of the T-Stick’s capabilities. No GUI is pro-
vided for this functionality since there exists no changeable
parameter.
3.3 Signal conditioning
The T-Patch includes a feature we call signal conditioning,
which allows users to modify sensor and gesture data to
create musical information. This includes modules such as
smooth, function, scale, randomization, and arithmetic op-
erations like addition, multiplication, absolute, and modulo.
These conditioners are modular, allowing users to combine
and chain them in any order for maximum creative control.
They provide users with a wide range of options to modify
data.
In addition, the signal conditioning functionality includes
the use of 32 bus channels (see Section 3.4), which allows
users to chain multiple conditioners in both serial and par-
allel ways. This added flexibility allows users to tailor the
T-Stick to their specific needs. For example, a user could
create a chain of smooth, function, scale, and randomization
conditioners, or a chain of smooth, function, scale, addition,
multiplication, and absolute conditioners to modify the data
in various ways.
In contrast to the Digital Orchestra Toolbox [4], which
provides a set of Max abstractions for signal conditioning,
the T-Patch integrates the signal conditioning functions into
its software, eliminating the need for programming skills.
Signal conditioners like the addition and multiplication
conditioners are essential for creating many-to-one map-
pings. These conditioners take in two input sources, for
instance, one serving as the multiplier and the other as the
multiplicand in a multiplication conditioner, making them
particularly useful in scenarios where multiple signals con-
verge in a many-to-one mapping (as depicted in Figure 4).
3.4 Mapping
The mapping functionality enables users to try different
mapping types, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-
Figure 4: The figure illustrates the GUI for the multiplication
signal conditioner.
one, and many-to-many mapping. The software provides 32
bus channels that allow users to transfer data between the
different signal conditioners (see Section 3.3) in a desired
order. This flexibility allows for a wide range of creative
possibilities and allows users to tailor the T-Stick to their
specific needs. For even more advanced mappings, libmap-
per can be utilized [5].
3.5 Sound synthesis
The sound synthesis functionality of the T-Patch allows
users to generate a wide range of sounds with the T-Stick.
The software includes 2 granular synthesis modules and 2
sample playback modules, each with a variety of customiz-
able parameters such as on/off, grain rate, pitch transpo-
sition, onset time, grain size, loudness, pan, window type,
and sound file import. These parameters can be set directly
using the preset layer in the sequencing functionality (intro-
duced in 3.6), or they can be mapped to sensor or gesture
data, allowing for dynamic changes in sound based on sensor
input and gesture detection. The granular synthesis mod-
ules and the sample playback modules allow users to import
their own sound samples and manipulate them in real time,
offering a wide range of possibilities for sound generation.
Figure 5: The figure illustrates the GUI for a granular syn-
thesis module. The GUI includes parameters for mapping
input sources and parameters for synthesis. These settings
can be saved as presets and recalled later, but will be over-
written if the module is receiving input values from a speci-
fied channel.
3.6 Sequencing
The sequencing functionality allows users to create dynamic
mappings and create music whose response to their gestures
changes over time. It consists of two layers: the cue layer
(figure 6) and the preset layer (figure 7). The cue layer al-
lows the user to specify which presets should be recalled at
a certain time, enabling transitions between presets. The
preset layer stores the settings of various parameters, such
as mapping, signal conditioning (e.g., multiplier value), and
sound synthesis (e.g., transposition and onset values), al-
lowing users to flexibly design a sequence of musical events.

ality

tionality
3.7 Scaled Values
To ensure flexibility in mapping and signal conditioning, all
sensor and gesture data values are scaled to a range between
0 and 1. This allows for interchangeable use of different
gesture types within the T-Patch and enables users to easily
switch between different gestures.
3.8 Implementation
The T-Patch was implemented using the Max visual pro-
gramming environment, which is a commonly used tool in
the digital music field. To simplify the user experience and
ensure compatibility, the software does not require any ex-
ternal dependencies such as libraries or Max objects. The
package also includes a launcher that automatically sets the
file path, making it easy for users to import the T-Patch ab-
stractions. T-Patch was optimized for both Windows and
Mac and works with the sopranino T-Sticks.
The T-Patch’s modular design makes it simple for instru-
ment designers to adapt it to other interfaces such as the
Karlax1 and the eigenharp 2. For instance, to use the Kar-
lax with the T-Patch, the designer only needs to modify
the OSC namespace and the setting of the scale Max ob-
ject, converting the Karlax sensor values (0 to 127) to the
T-Patch’s required scaled value range (0 to 1) as mentioned
in Section 3.7. This adaptability of the T-Patch increases
productivity for DMI designers.

4. TUTORIAL VIDEOS
The T-Patch comes with accompanying tutorial videos that
guide users through the setup and operation of the T-Stick,
as well as the creation of custom mappings between sen-
sor/gesture data and sound parameters. These tutorials
aim to provide a quick and easy way for users to familiarize
themselves with the T-Patch application and start creating
music with the T-Stick.
Figure 8: The figure depicts the tutorial video.
5. EARLY OBSERV ATIONS ON USER EX-
PERIENCE
In a series of weekly workshops, three students with no pro-
gramming skills and no prior experience with digital mu-
sical instruments were introduced to the T-Patch and the
T-Stick. They were given the option to compose using ei-
ther the T-Stick or the Karlax DMI. At the time of writing
this paper, the workshops have only been held five times
and the project is still in its early stages.
The T-Patch software application was developed and in-
troduced to composers with an elementary level of technical
expertise during a series of weekly workshops. The early
observation implies that, although its impact on music cre-
ation is still an open question, the application significantly
reduces the entrance effort for testing the T-Stick.
Along with the in-person introduction to the software,
video tutorials were provided to explain how to set up the T-
Stick, produce sound, and map gestures to synthetic param-
eters. Initial observations showed that the students were
able to successfully set up and play the T-Stick and create
their desired mappings.
6. DISCUSSIONS
However, the results of the workshop series indicated that
the three students favored the Karlax over the T-Stick for
their compositions. This choice was driven by the require-
ment that their compositions be performed by other musi-
cians, who preferred the form and mechanism such as the
keys of the Karlax, and the saxophonist and guitarist they
asked to perform for them were more familiar with it. Ad-
ditionally, one student reported difficulties in producing the
desired sound on the T-Stick due to its unique shape and
sensor configuration, which differs from traditional acoustic
instruments.
The preference for the Karlax highlights the need for a
performance demo video of the T-Stick. The lack of ded-
icated T-Stick performers and demonstrations showcasing
the instrument’s capabilities in actual compositions made
it challenging for the students to envision how to compose
for the T-Stick. While the video tutorial that demonstrated
playing techniques and sounds helped to lower the barrier
of entry for new users, there is a need for videos that il-
lustrate the T-Stick’s potential in compositional contexts,
especially for an instrument that requires a different per-
formance practice from existing acoustic instruments. This
insight resonates with Perry’s Principle 5, which suggests
to prioritize creating a music composition over building an
instrument or controller [1]. In retrospect, showcasing exist-
ing compositions for the T-Stick at the start of the workshop
series would have given the composers a better understand-
ing of how to perform the instrument.
7. LIMITATIONS
The T-Patch project is not without limitations. Firstly, to
use the T-Patch effectively, a certain amount of learning is
required. The developers have attempted to minimize the
learning curve for users by providing in-person workshops
and instructional videos. However, users still need to invest
time and effort in learning the software. Secondly, the soft-
ware is implemented in the Max environment, which may
cause compatibility issues if the Max version is updated. To
address this limitation, the development team is exploring
options to compile the T-Patch as a standalone application
to ensure compatibility and minimize disruptions.
In terms of functionality, the T-Patch is specifically de-
signed for the sopranino T-Stick and is not compatible with
other T-Stick variations such as soprano, alto, and tenor.
Additionally, the T-Patch currently only offers granular syn-
thesis and sample playback modules for sound synthesis,
limiting the creative options for users who might want to ex-
periment with other synthesis techniques. Furthermore, the
T-Patch only supports preset recall through button presses
and does not currently allow for changing presets using ges-
tures.
Lastly, the T-Patch package, as an educational tool, lacked
a video that demonstrated the instrument’s potential in a
compositional setting. This was noted as a shortfall after
the workshop series, where the three composers ultimately
chose to compose using the Karlax instead of the T-Stick.
The lack of a video showcasing the compositional possibili-
ties of the T-Stick may have contributed to the composers’
decision. To address this, we now recognize the importance
of including a video that demonstrates the T-Stick’s com-
positional capabilities.
8. FUTURE WORK
Future work aims to evaluate the accessibility of the T-
Stick with the T-Patch application. Three factors will be
investigated: (1)the motivations for composers choosing the
Karlax over the T-Stick, (2)the extent to which T-Patch has
reduced the entrance effort for using the T-Stick and (3)the
impact of T-Patch on the users’ creativity. To identify the
composers’ motivations, the project envisions an interview
with them after the end of the workshop series. To mea-
sure the users’ experience, the project will conduct question-
naires to gather feedback on the ease of use of T-Patch and
T-Stick. To understand the limitations of T-Patch in terms
of sound creation, the project will compare the versatility
of gesture-sound mappings between a group using T-Patch
and another group creating their own patch. Additionally,
a comparative study with lib mapper-compatible mapping
interfaces is within the scope. Combined with qualitative
research analysis, these approaches will facilitate to reduc-
ing the researchers’ biases.
T-Patch will be expanded to meet the needs of composers.
More functions will be added to enhance the signal condi-
tioning functionality, such as a quantizer that can convert
sensor values into pitches on musical scales. The sound syn-
thesis capabilities will be expanded by incorporating more
synthesis techniques, allowing for a wider range of sounds
and textures. Audio effects, such as filters and reverber-
ation, will also be added. The possibility of making the
T-Patch compatible with other T-Stick models, such as so-
prano and tenor, will also be explored.
Support and workshops for T-Patch users will continue to
be provided, along with improved documentation and tuto-
rials. Redesign of the GUI from the spreadsheet paradigm
will be considered to make the interface design more in-
tuitive and enhance the learnability of the software with
or without our guidance. A data-logging feature will be in-
cluded to allow users to record and save their performances.
Demonstration videos will be created to illustrate the map-
ping between playing techniques and sounds, providing per-
formers and composers with a comprehensive understanding
of the instrument’s capabilities and potential.
The goal is to continue to improve the T-Patch and make
the T-Stick more accessible to a wider range of users. The
project aims to provide a flexible software application that
addresses the lack of music-making support in the existing
T-Stick package and inspire new users.
9. CONCLUSION
The T-Patch addresses the lack of dedicated software for
the sopranino T-Stick by offering a user-friendly GUI and
programming-free controls. This allows users to easily ad-
just and fine-tune the T-Stick to achieve their desired sound
and expression, and opens up new creative possibilities for
composers. The signal conditioning functionality, with mod-
ules for smooth, function, scale, randomization, and arith-
metic operations, provides users with a wide range of op-
tions to modify sensor and gesture data in ways that are
idiomatic to the T-Stick. The use of 32 bus channels for
chaining multiple conditioning functions in both serial and
parallel ways enhances the expressiveness of the instrument
and allows users to tailor it to their specific needs.
However, our early observations of the users indicate the
need for demonstration content, such as a video, to show-
case the instrument’s possibilities in a compositional con-
text and inspire new users. This is especially important
for performers who are accustomed to playing acoustic in-
struments, as there are currently few dedicated T-Stick per-
formers. To make the T-Stick more accessible and versatile
for musicians, we recommend that educational packages for
DMIs include hardware, software, tutorial, and demo video
content. We hope that the T-Patch will contribute to the
longevity and widespread use of the T-Stick, making it a
valuable tool for composers and musicians alike.

11. ETHICAL STANDARDS
There is no funding source for this research and are no ob-
served conflicts of interest. Composers’ comments on why
they chose to compose for the Karlax rather than the T-
Stick were stated in a voluntary manner during the work-
shops in their knowledge that the feedback might be used
to improve our research.
