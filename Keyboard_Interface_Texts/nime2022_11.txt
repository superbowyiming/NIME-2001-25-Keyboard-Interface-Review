ABSTRACT
Music technology ensembles—often consisting of multiple laptops as the performers’ 
primary instrument—provide collaborative artistic experiences for electronic 
musicians. In an effort to remove the significant technical and financial barriers that 
laptops can present to performers looking to start their own group, this paper 
proposes a solution in the form of the Norns Shield, a computer music instrument 
(CMI) that requires minimal set-up and promotes immediate music-making to 
performers of all skill levels. Prior research centered on using alternative CMIs to 
supplant laptops in ensemble settings is discussed, and the benefits of adopting the 
Norns Shield in service of democratizing and diversifying the music technology 
ensemble are demonstrated in a discussion centered on the University of Texas Rio 
Grande Valley New Music Ensemble’s adoption of the instrument. A description of two 
software packages developed by the author showcases an extension of the 
instrument’s abilities to share collaborative control data between internet-enabled 
CMIs and to remotely manage script launching and parameter configuration across a 
group of Norns Shields, providing resources for ensembles interested in incorporating 
the device into their ranks.

Introduction
Music Technology ensembles provide group performative experiences for musicians 
who look to electronic instruments as their primary vehicle for sonic expression [1]. 
Often centered in academic programs, the trend that began in 2005 with Princeton’s 
PLOrk has grown into an international movement, with similar groups consisting of 
homogenous setups centered on laptops as the primary instruments. Previous research

has stated the benefits of outfitting each performer with a laptop: the range of 
methods for interlinking ensemble members to share collaborative control data 
between one another, the deployment of virtual instruments hosted in any number of 
creative audio platforms, the modern digital signal processing horsepower afforded by 
such a machine, and the ease of troubleshooting software issues across similar devices 
[2]. 
While these affordances make laptops a natural choice for music technology 
ensembles, they are not without issue. Groups whose leaders or members have little or 
no previous experience performing with computer music instruments (CMIs) can 
encounter significant technical barriers during their rehearsals and performances. The 
monetary investment required to outfit multiple performers with their own laptops can 
present a financial barrier to many music technology programs as well as to the 
students asked to provide their own personal machines to fill out an ensemble’s ranks. 
Additionally, the wide range of software options available for music performance on a 
laptop can leave burgeoning electronic musicians feeling overwhelmed, and few of the 
most popular choices make it easy for beginners to jump right to the music-making 
process. Dynamic coding environments such as Max and Pure Data and DAWs tailored 
for live performance such as Ableton Live provide immense potential to computer 
musicians but require a considerable time investment to learn the skills necessary for 
building bespoke digital music instruments or becoming comfortable with the 
platform’s layout and workflow. Students in academic programs are privy to the 
tutelage of their courses and teachers to guide them through the digital music 
instrument (DMI) development process and some global community workshops are 
available to those outside of academia. In either case, the near-unlimited potential to 
build complex sound generators with dense user interfaces in these platforms can lock 
ensembles comprised of novice performers into a pattern of spending their rehearsal 
time focusing on learning the requirements for making music with a particular tool [3]. 
Presenting newcomers with experiences that circumvent the dense managerial tasks, 
financial boundaries, and overwhelming interaction methods previously described can 
provide ensemble directors and members alike with an easier path to starting their 
own ensembles, both in and beyond university settings.
This paper presents a solution in the form of the Norns Shield, a laptop alternative 
with appeal to performers of all skills levels that was adopted for use in the University 
of Texas Rio Grande Valley New Music Ensemble. The following sections discuss prior 
approaches at democratizing the music technology ensemble through the use of mobile 
devices and single-board computers, the affordances provided by the Norns Shield and

a comparison to similar “tabletop” CMIs, and the creation of new software used to 
remotely manage multiple Norns Shields and provide enhanced telematic collaboration 
options between performers. 
Prior Approaches
Smartphones and Tablets
In the spirit of democratizing and diversifying the music technology ensemble, 
previous research has explored concerted efforts to build ensembles around CMIs 
other than laptops. The ubiquity of smartphones and tablets presents ensembles with 
the option of using an instrument that its members are likely to already own, avoiding 
the need to source start-up funding [4]. The portability of mobile devices provides 
opportunities to move beyond traditional concert environments, and their inherent 
networking capabilities open the door to cultivating interactive experiences between 
performers and audiences [5][6].
Universal adoption of smartphones as ensemble devices can present groups with 
unique challenges. Developing custom applications [7] or converting preexisting 
software creations [8] can be required to extend the pool of virtual instruments 
compatible with each device’s specific operating system.  While the WebAudio API 
serves as a cross-platform option for generating new tools, the process of designing 
graphical user interfaces and audio processing engines can be daunting to first-time 
coders despite the existence of helpful JavaScript libraries [9][10][11].  
Single-board Computers
Single-board computers (SBCs) such as the Raspberry Pi and the Bela [12] are low-
cost alternatives to laptops for ensembles to consider [13] [14]. These devices can be 
flashed with a customized OS helpful for developing and running software instruments 
[15], and they share a laptop’s ability to connect to a wired or wireless network, 
making collaborative networked musical performances possible on a smaller, more 
affordable machine. The inclusion of compact soundcards and/or sensor “hats” allow 
performers to interact with software instruments through sonic, tactile, or motion 
input.
 While the move toward SBCs lowers the financial barriers of starting an ensemble, 
their adoption poses issues in the form of practical usability for novices.  Reaping the 
benefits of an SBC’s cost, portability, and small form factor means sacrificing screens, 
keyboards, and trackpads, thereby removing graphical user interfaces and the ability

to easily navigate through the OS. On a laptop or mobile device, these features provide 
intuitive means for interacting with virtual instruments and launching/switching 
between software during performances. The act of writing shell scripts or 
communicating with each instrument through a remote terminal connection to launch 
and modify the software is a common workaround, but these techniques can be 
daunting to those without prior programming experience, and off-putting to those who 
wish to begin performing immediately.
A Solution through Tabletop CMIs
In recent years, a slew of portable, “tabletop” computer music instruments built with 
SBCs at heart (such as the Critter & Guitari Organelle,1 the OWL programmable 
pedal,2 and the Daisy suite of instruments3) have sprung onto the marketplace. These 
devices add integrated audio I/O hardware and tactile control elements into the 
equation and their physical form factors mimic existing electronic instruments such as 
guitar pedals and synthesizers, providing users with intuitive designs and familiar 
performance interfaces. Mimicking a laptop’s versatility, a single device can switch 
roles with ease. To program these instruments, users simply “drag and drop” sketches 
that have been built in platforms such as Max, Pure Data, or written in C++ onto the 
instrument over a USB connection. Libraries of pre-existing patches and scripts 
developed by community members provide a valuable resource for ensembles whose 
members are reticent or unable to program their own software instruments.
The Norns Shield
 The Norns Shield was chosen as the ideal CMI for introducing students in the UTRGV 
New Music Ensemble to the experience of group performance with technology. 
Developed by Monome, the Norns Shield: A) narrows the options of musical tools to 
choose from to simplify and expedite the act of making music, B) offers a low barrier of 
entry for beginners looking to explore CMI performance due to its price and familiar 
interface elements, and C) provides a pathway toward expanded use of the device 
through scalable education resources for software development, opening doors to 
those who wish to collaborate and create in a “low floors, high ceilings, and wide 
walls” environment [16]. The Norns Shield is a single PCB add-on board for a 
Raspberry Pi Model 3b adding a 128 x 64-pixel screen, three rotary encoders, three 
buttons, audio I/O circuitry, and 3.5mm jacks to the popular pocket-size computer.  At 
the time of publication, a Norns Shield cost approximately $330 USD, putting the 
instrument  at a higher cost than some bespoke SBC setups4 but at a competitive price 
point when compared to the majority of laptops used in music technology ensembles.

 Popular in the Eurorack and boutique synthesizer communities, the Norns Shield’s 
prominence on social media and in global electronic musical circles places it in a 
unique position to entice newcomers, and the instrument provides a number of 
benefits to users who are new to performing with CMIs. The instrument’s minimal 
operating system streamlines the means of managing its script collection, writing 
preset configuration files, assigning MIDI controller and audio system configurations 
on the fly, and storing and creating media files for use in performance. Users interact 
with the Norns Shield OS through the onboard encoders and keys and are presented 
with a graphical user interface displayed on the built-in screen. These methods of 
interaction are intuitive for those who have limited experience with embedded 
systems, empowering users to make alterations to their instrument without requiring 
the use of a command-line interface or the addition of an external monitor, keyboard, 
and mouse. 
As is the case with the tabletop CMI platforms mentioned previously, the Norns Shield 
behaves as a musical chameleon; users launch applications referred to as "scripts" by 
scrolling through an on-screen list, and each new script changes the core functionality 
of the instrument. While it boasts fewer physical interface elements in comparison to 
devices like the Owl pedal or the Organelle, multiple options exist for incorporating 
custom controllers due to the Norns Shield’s four USB ports, Wi-Fi connectivity, and 
global Open Sound Control (OSC) access to any script’s parameters.

Operating System and Software Development Opportunities
The Norns Shield OS is designed to run applications that follow a rigid system 
architecture, a notable caveat that limits its flexibility for virtual instrument 
developers. For each script, audio processing/synthesis is handled by either a provided 
SuperCollider engine or Softcut, Monome's custom sample recording and playback 
software. Interactivity with the underlying audio process is handled through a Lua 
script that interprets and passes data to and from the Norns Shield hardware. This 
results in a narrow means of developing software to run on the instrument which could 
be a hindrance for ensembles hoping to build applications in platforms such as Max, 
Pure Data, the Web Audio API, or C++ and run them on all ensemble instruments 
uniformly. 
While the SuperCollider and Lua script format presents certain limitations, there are 
benefits to the existing infrastructure. The device’s creators promote the Norns Shield 
as both an instrument and a scalable educational platform aimed at democratizing the 
process of musical software development. New users and ensembles can gradually 
extend the role the device plays in their creative sandbox, first performing with the 
default library of synthesizer and digital signal processing scripts before gradually 
exploring the process of creating their own scripts. Through extensive tutorials and 
reference documentation provided by Monome5 and workshops led by developers in 
the global community, the Norns Shield is designed to help first-time programmers 
wade into the development process, and the large collection of user-created scripts 
available through online community-driven repositories6 provide new virtual 
instruments to those looking to focus solely on performing. Furthermore, these 
resources and support systems serve as accessible opportunities for creative audio 
programming education outside of traditional academic institutions.
Utilizing The Norns Shield in an Ensemble 
While the Norns Shield excels as a flexible CMI, certain limitations presented the 
opportunity for improvement. In early tests, UTRGV ensemble members encountered 
issues that limited the potential of the instrument to provide networked, collaborative 
performance opportunities and concert management tasks. By default, sharing control 
data between co-located performers is limited to sending OSC or MIDI messages, and 
interaction over a telematic network was only available through a single script at the 
time of this paper’s writing: norns.online, developed by Zach Scholl [17]. Relying on 
OSC limits the performer’s ability to collaborate telematically without establishing and 
maintaining their own remote server, and the remote performance opportunities

provided by norns.online are limited by that script’s use of a web browser interface for 
controlling a single Norns Shield in a 1-to-1 interaction topology. In regards to 
managing multiple Norns Shields in a concert or rehearsal environment with the goal 
of saving time and minimizing errors navigating the menu-dense OS, no preexisting 
script provided the ability for a single user to carry out tasks such as loading and 
switching between scripts, setting a shared tempo and clock source, and recalling 
parameter presets globally across multiple devices.
To extend the Norns Shield’s abilities to communicate between internet-enabled 
devices and other CMIs across local and remote networks and manage higher-level 
system functions across multiple instruments, two new scripts—CH-Norns and 
Ensemble—were developed for the ensemble. The following sections detail how these 
scripts work and the benefits they offer to users interested in integrating multiple 
Norns Shields into networked music performances.
CH-Norns
CH-Norns [18] is a software package that enables Norns Shields to send and receive 
control data across a wireless network in multiple interaction topologies. Built with the

Collab-Hub framework [19], CH-Norns gives an ensemble the ability to create 
collaborative performances by linking their device with laptops (i.e. software 
instruments built using client packages available for Max and Pure Data), mobile 
devices (through a JavaScript library for web browsers), and custom 
instruments/interfaces built with Wi-Fi-enabled microcontrollers. Collab-Hub offers 
users options to use either their remote cloud-based version of their server or to run a 
local instance of the server to take advantage of low-latency transmission speeds 
during co-located performances.
The CH-Norns package consists of a customized version of the Collab-Hub OSC client-
end server and the primary Lua script. The script serves as a utility for performers to 
connect to the network, set and modify their username, join or leave subgroups of 
users known as Rooms, and manage data sent and received between other ensemble 
members. Performers start by setting their username and intended Room from the 
Connect page and then launch the server with a single button press, establishing a 
connection to the Collab-Hub network over Wi-Fi. Once the background server is 
running, performers can navigate away from CH-Norns, load any script from their 
library, and have its performance parameters remotely modified by a fellow ensemble. 
In the background, CH-Norns passes data between the currently loaded script and 
other connected clients by first converting it to and from OSC messages. Performers 
can navigate Back to CH-Norns’ Send page to transmit control data tagged with the 
header of their choice.  Data received from users that is not tagged with a header 
specific to the currently loaded script’s parameters can be mapped from the Get page.7

CH-Norns presents opportunities to adjust interaction topologies dynamically without 
the need to stop and modify the server when changes are made. Additionally, control 
and event data sent through the network can come from any number of sources—
tangible hardware interfaces, autonomous data-generating bots, or software GUIs—
providing a range of methods for mediating intended performance control over a 
Norns Shield.
Ensemble
The Ensemble [20] script was created to eliminate the script selection, clock settings, 
and preset modification process for the performer, allowing a single user to remotely 
launch scripts and configure audio engine parameters across a group of Norns Shields 
and reducing the time spent menu diving during performances and rehearsals. The 
core functionality of the script was modeled after automation systems such as the 
Laptop Orchestra of Louisiana’s GRENDL  [21] and a similar ensemble management 
process practiced by the Raspberry Pi Orchestra at Virginia Tech [22].
Ensemble makes use of the Collab-Hub OSC Client-end server from the CH-Norns 
collection. On launch, each user designates their role as either a Performer in the 
group or as the Conductor before connecting to the Collab-Hub server. The Conductor 
Norns UI provides two pages of controls for managing ensemble members: Concert 
Program controls and Concert Clock controls. The Concert Program page allows the 
Conductor to move through a pre-programmed Concert, a pre-loaded file containing 
pairs of piece titles and performance data packets to be sent out to each Performer 
Norns.8

At the press of a key, the Conductor transmits data from the Concert document as the 
rehearsal or performance progresses. Performance data packets contain the name of 
the script to load and the preset collection file name to recall, and any specific data to 
pass to the script's audio engine that isn't mapped to a pre-coded parameter. In the 
following example from a Concert document, all Performer Norns are told to load the 
Awake script, load the "DMaj_Jam" preset file, and set the length of Sequence Pattern 
2 to seven for the first piece on the Concert1 program:
"Concert1": { 
 
    "opener": [ 
 
      { 
 
        "script": "awake", 
 
        "presets": "DMaj_Jam", 
 
        "messages": [ 
 
          { 
 
            "type": "control", 
 
            "header": "two_length", 
 
            "val": 7 
 
          } 
 
        ] 
 
      } 
 
    ] 
 
  }
The Concert Clock page displays controls to set the tempo and start the transport on 
each Performer Norns simultaneously. This option is only available when connecting to 
a locally-run Collab-Hub server and requires Ableton Link to work.
Only one Norns Shield can be designated as the Conductor at a time, and Performers 
are blocked from sending out script-loading calls. Once connected to the network, the 
role of each ensemble member is fixed until they log off from the server. These 
protocols were enacted in order to avoid any accidental disruption of a rehearsal 
session or concert performance as well as to provide a necessary step granting consent 
before a user’s instrument can be manipulated.

Conclusion and Further Directions
Use of the Norns Shield in the UTRGV New Music Ensemble’s rehearsals and 
performances has shown encouraging signs of the device’s ability to serve as a laptop 
alternative. Both novice and experienced music technology users in the group have 
embraced the creative tools provided by preexisting scripts, and the development of 
the CH-Norns and Ensemble scripts has streamlined managerial tasks and presented 
ensemble members with a platform for designing networked musical performances. To 
aid members of the global Norns development community in their own ensemble-
centered projects, both of the aforementioned scripts have been published online as 
open-source software.9
In addition to its expanded use in future performances, the ensemble plans to host 
multiple outreach events centered on the Norns Shield at local high schools and 
performing arts academies. These events will take the form of workshops and concerts 
that promote the device’s use as an entry-level instrument for those interested in 
starting music technology ensembles in their own schools and communities.
