ABSTRACT
One of the reasons of why some musical instruments more
successfully continue their evolution and actively take part
in the history of music is partially attributed to the existing
compositions made speciﬁcally for them, pieces that remain
and are still played over a long period of time. This is some-
thing we know, performing these compositions keeps the
characteristics of the instruments alive and able to survive.
This paper presents our contribution to this discussion with
a context and historical background for idiomatic composi-
tions. Looking beyond the classical era, we discuss how the
concept of idiomatic music has inﬂuenced research and com-
position practices in the NIME community; drawing more
attention in the way current idiomatic composition prac-
tices considered speciﬁc NIME aﬀordances for sonic, social
and spatial interaction. We present particular projects that
establish idiomatic writing as a part of a new repertoire for
new musical instruments. The idiomatic writing approach
to composing music for NIME can shift the unique charac-
teristics of new instruments to a more established musical
identity, providing a shared understanding and a common
literature to the community.

1. INTRODUCTION
Some musical instruments successfully continue their evolu-
tion in the history of music. Whereas social, technological,
sonic, physical and tangible features could have equally im-
portant roles in the survival of musical instruments, build-
ing and maintaining a repertoire for them reﬂects a histor-
ical practice to make this happen. In accordance with the
history of music, the ways and means of practicing music

compositions with an idiomatic approach have provided a
ground for instruments to evolve in form and sound quali-
ties as well as a mutual pedagogical method, a shared un-
derstanding and a common literature [29]. Moreover, these
existing compositions made for them remain and are still
performed over a long period of time allowing these id-
iomatic practices build up a shared performance practice
and musical experience within a community, keeping the
characteristics of the instruments alive, not disappearing in
history [25]. Arriving at basic foundations of such musical
identity that is more in line with the unique characteristics
of new instruments is essential to the NIME community;
as discussed in the NIME 2016 keynote, common practice
is that new instruments often reﬂect “short-lived expression
of individualism ” rather than a design for a broader audi-
ence [18]. Idiomatic composition practice is an appropriate
approach to develop dedicated repertoire for a NIME, re-
ﬂecting the sonic and interaction aﬀordances of new musical
instrument and encouraging other practitioners to perform
compositions written for that NIME.
In this paper we present a context and historical back-
ground for idiomatic writing as well as some grounds for in-
teresting discussions regarding idiomatic writing practices
in which a NIME’s aﬀordances for interaction have been
considered to be contextualised as part of idiomatic com-
position. In particular, we present three projects in detail
that establish idiomatic writing as a part of new repertoire
for new musical instrument.
2. IDIOMATIC WRITING AND ITS HISTOR-
ICAL BACKGROUND
The term ‘idiomatic’ or ‘idiomatic music’ rarely leaves room
for interpretation. The largely accepted deﬁnition seems to
be that a composition language deﬁned as idiomatic is “a
style appropriate for the instrument for which particular
music is written,” as stated in the Harvard Dictionary of
Music [20]. However, the further implications and cultural
impact of idiomatic writing can be a controversial topic with
divergent opinions. In the same dictionary deﬁnition, it is
suggested that “the quality of (a) score is judged largely
by the degree to which the various parts exploit the tech-
nical and sonorous resources of the instruments without
exceeding them”. Nonetheless, it is also pointed out that
a closer analysis of J.S. Bach’s music questions this aﬃr-
mation. For instance, the E-major Fugue from The Well
Tempered Clavier, vol. ii is not particularly suitable for the
physical properties of the harpsichord nor the clavichord. It
calls to the attention that Bach would write a non-idiomatic
piece for harpsichord given his status as a recognised “con-
certising virtuoso” of keyboard music [33]. Moreover, if we

determine whether the spiralling ornament on top

deﬁnition of ‘well-temperament’[15]
approach ‘idiomatic style’ focusing on exploring a physical
property of an particular instrument, The Well Tempered
Clavier (WTC) is indeed a seminal example of idiomatic
writing (Figure 1): The WTC was the ﬁrst collection of
pieces in history traversing all 24 keys in a single keyboard
instrument, imposing a new milestone in the possibilities of
the instrument [1].
Quite often in the past, idiomatic writing also pushed
the boundaries on how a performer approaches an instru-
ment. The idiomatic possibilities of a solo voice explored
by composers in the early baroque ultimately “crystallised
in the reﬁned methods of the Italian bel canto”, introduced
an entire new aesthetic approach to lyric singing [5]. Sim-
ilarly, Paganini’s 24 Caprices encouraged new pedagogical
methodologies to teach violin given the new limits imposed
by the highly-challenging pieces [3]. At the same time, we
could identify a concept of an ‘idiomatic performance’ as a
desire to emulate as closely as possible the physical charac-
teristics of the instruments for which a piece was composed.
Paul Holland’s violin methodology describes how “students
are taught to hold the bow farther up the stick toward the
balance point”, in order to recreate the same sound pro-
duced by the characteristic Baroque bow when performing
scores from that period of musical creation [10]. The aim to
exploit new developments of the instruments played an im-
portant role for instrument standards also in the nineteenth
century. Herbert Horn pointed out that new developments
aimed towards technically improved instruments resulted
in establishment of the piano as “the universal household
instrument” [11]. The relationship between creation of id-
iomatic repertoire and the historical development of acous-
tic instruments is strong and can be traced in time as the
former evolves symbiotically depending on the possibilities
oﬀered by the later [28].
2.1 Idiomatic Composition beyond the Clas-
sical Era
In contemporary music, the concept of ‘idiomaticism’ was
challenged by the widespread use of extended techniques
in acoustic instruments, considered precisely an extension
of the idiom [28]. In a similar vein, the term ‘radically
idiomatic’ was coined by Richard Barrett to describe an in-
tense level of artistic physical dialogue with the instrument
performed [9]. The main idea behind this method was to
eliminate any sight of frontier between the composition and
the physical dimension of the instrument, evolving from a
symbiotic relationship into a indistinguishable monolithic
aesthetic discourse. On the opposite side of the spectrum,
intentionally non-idiomatic music for a non-conventional in-
strument, as an ampliﬁed/modiﬁed toy piano has also been
implemented before [34].
Finally, some theorists use the term ‘idiomatic music’
and furthermore ‘idiomatic improvisation’ to deﬁne a set of
characteristics of speciﬁc musical genre -or stylistic features-
in the context of improvisation, rather to refer to speciﬁc
instrument where the music is performed [6]. Using ‘id-
iomatic’ and ‘stylistic’ as exchangeable terms, is, however,
less frequent practice, more common in genres with highly
improvisatory structure, such as Jazz.
2.2 Theremin
Among the many attempts to create musical devices for
musical expression using technology, some seemed to have
resisted the test of the time relatively well. One of them is
the Theremin, the well-known instrument invented by Leon
Theremin in 1917 (patented in 1921 in Russia and ﬁlled for
the US patent in Dec 5 of 1925) [16]. Leon Theremin -
an exceptional performer himself- travelled extensively ﬁrst
through Russia and later in the United States demonstrat-
ing the capabilities of his invention. [8] The repertoire, how-
ever, was mainly adaptations of existing music from the
common-practice period; Figure 2 shows the 1928 version
of Rimsky-Korsakov’s Scheherazade for Theremin and Or-
chestra performed in New York. Theremin’s eﬀort ensured a
signiﬁcant media attention, including high-proﬁle concerts
with top orchestras in the United States. As a result, a
vast number of original, idiomatic music was created for
the instrument by composers of the time. Warren Brodsky
made a thorough catalog of works exclusively written for
the Theremin, thanks to which he concludes that the instru-
ment became responsible of “preempting all other electronic
instruments and becoming the standard method of produc-
ing electronic sound until the advent of the transistor in the
late 1960s”[4]. A similar example with substantial idiomatic
works can be found in the “Ondes Martenot”, a keyboard-
based instrument in which repertoire was expanded by some
prominent composers, Olivier Messiaen among them [2].
3. COMPOSING MUSIC FOR NEW MUSI-
CAL INSTRUMENTS
The concept of idiomatic music has inﬂuenced research in
the ﬁeld of music technology in various ways. Huron and
Berec designed a systematic method to analyse Trumpet
recordings and measured the level of diﬃculty and what
was described as ‘idiomaticsm’ -or level of suitability for
the instrument-. In the study there is an association of
idiomatic writing with lower levers of diﬃculty and the
authors mention the importance of diﬀerentiating between
performance diﬃculty and level of idiomaticism. The lat-
ter is relative, according to the conclusions, by such factors
as tempo and key transposition [12]. Another attempt in
analysis of idiomatic features in music can be found in the
semi-automatic grammatical approach to analysis of chord
Figure 2: Programme from the concert of Leon
Theremin with the New York Philharmonic Orches-
tra conducted by Willem Van Raten, in August 27th

sequences by Keller et al. [13], in what they call ‘idiomatic
analysis’. This methodology was released as a free, open-
source software called Impro-Viso. However, once more, the
concept of ’idiomaticism’ is related here to genre, aka. the
set of stylistic rules proper to Jazz [13].
Earlier in 1981, Rolnick advocated for a performance model
that made full use of the physical characteristics of a syn-
thesiser [21]. In 1986, Rolnick also addressed the issue of
developing an idiom for computer music and performance
with musical instruments developed with technology [22].
The lack of commonalities between technological interfaces
has been seen as an impediment to build a common compo-
sitional framework that can deﬁne what is, or not idiomatic
in a broader sense for computer music. Furthermore, the
continuous advancement of technology presents a challenge
in its own right: “If composition for synthesiser and com-
puter performance is to develop in ways at all analogous to
the development of music for other instruments, composers
will have to ﬁgure out how to write for these systems in a
way which takes into accounts the fact of constant changes
in software and hardware” [22]. Similarly, Saariaho makes
an reﬂection about considering computer music composi-
tion as an ‘idiom’ by itself. She deﬁnes the Vers Le Blanc
as “Idiomatic to the computer medium (but) impossible to
realise with traditional instruments.” [23].
However, currently in the ﬁeld the most common applica-
tion of idiomatic writing resides in the composition of mu-
sic for new musical instruments. Pieces composed having
in mind physical characteristics of a new musical instru-
ment include the piece “Pico I for Seashells and Interactive
Glove”, based in enhancing with sensors a hand gesture over
a seashell perceived as idiomatic [7]. In user studies with the
NIME “T-Stick”, the authors reported an eﬀort to develop
“notation standards and a vocabulary of gestures idiomatic
to the interface” [17]. Some of those eﬀorts were later incor-
porated as default setting of the instrument’s performance
practice and learning. As another example, we can mention
the application of idiomatic composition in a framework for
locative media, or “Idiomatic Locative Media” in a research
conducted by Atau Tanaka [31].
3.1 Bio Muse and Global String
Atau Tanaka has embraced idiomatic writing as a central
part of his practice. Tanaka’s departure point has been
establishing a parallelism between idiomatic music in the
common-practice period and creation of new repertoire for
Figure 4: Global String explores ‘performative id-
iom’, reﬂecting the social interaction aﬀordances of
the installation piece.
new musical interfaces [28]. Nevertheless, the importance
of idiomatic writing for Tanaka goes well beyond the mere
physical development of the interface. He points out that a
new deﬁnition of idiomatic has to be achieved for each new
instrument built, due to having no “codiﬁed performance
practice” yet developed for the new device. Tanaka leaves
open the discussion if in this context the new idiom shall re-
fer to a piece, or to a composers’ unique aesthetic language.
[28]. Even though Tanaka was speaking speciﬁcally about
sensor instruments, however, liberating and inspiring new
framework of artistic expression can be applied to a much
wider range of technologically enhanced musical interfaces.
In relation to the idiomatic practices, Tanaka introduces
a summary of projects of a diverse nature involving musical
interfaces with various types of sensors [28]. One of them
is BioMuse, a controller that transforms bioelectric signals
into MIDI data [14]. Tanaka was commissioned to create
content and produce a concert premiere for this interface
(Figure 3). Regarding BioMuse and the idiomatic approach
that Tanaka took, an “extremely personal vocabulary” was
constructed with the instrument, possible thanks to playing
the double role of composer/performer. Tanaka considers
the mapping of the information extracted from the biosig-
nals as the “score” of the piece. He deﬁnes the composition
as a process of sound organisation correlative to the inter-
face’s output, or “the choice and combination of diﬀerent
biosignal post-processing techniques as connected to vari-
ous synthesis articulations, placed in context of a musical
structure over time” [28].
Furthermore, Tanaka makes allusions to the ‘multi-site
network music installation’ called Global String [30]. He
describes the term ‘performative idiom’, which is extracted
from the interaction of multiple users with the installation,
allowing to identify certain ‘common tendency’ on the ex-
ploration of possibilities with the system. Figure 4 shows
the Global String installation that features a ‘concert mode’,
allowing soloist to perform at distance communicating by
visual and sonic cues, in the equivalent of a score.
3.2 No More Together
No More Together is a composition written as a part of
repertoire for the PESI interactive performance system, ex-
ploring speciﬁc musical and expressive possibilities through
the aﬀordances of the system [19]. Figure 5 depicts the
score that guides the musicians to choose from three given
176
Figure 5: The composition score of No More To-
gether
states with instruction to change the current state. Follow-
ing the score, musicians remain listening and responding to
overall collective sound. These three parts of the score keep
the musicians in and out of synchrony, with the possibil-
ity of keeping them all in the same state (Figure 6). The
score enables the musicians to explore the expressive, social,
spatial and interactive aﬀordances of the PESI interactive
music system as well as providing alternative states on be-
ing able to specify on various levels how the composition
develops during the performance. The main characteristic
of the score is that it facilitates a dynamic social interaction
among three musicians. At the same time, these three con-
tradictory states in the score creates potential moments for
accidental interactions to happen during the performance
[19].
Coordination of the three musicians through their spa-
tial location forms a social interaction that allows musicians
to dynamically modify the control features of the sound
synthesis module, simply by changing their distance from
each other and their location in the performance space [24].
Space and social actions are deeply interconnected and re-
ﬂect the unique characteristic of the system, bringing up
new ways of musical exploration in group music activity. So-
cial interaction in a shared performance spaces also makes
musicians consciously aware of their presence as well as of
others. The focus on the self and others awareness is rein-
forced in the composition by being able to control others’
sounds through one’s spatial relation to them. The condi-
tions of such social interaction increase the musicians’ mu-
tual engagement during the performance of the piece.
3.3 NOISA Etude #1, #2 and #3
Figure 6: No More Together performance, Gold-
smiths, London 2013
‘NOISA Etude #1, #2 and #3’ are music compositions
that featured ‘idiomaticsm’ not only in the creation of the
pieces, but also in the design of the instrument, the Net-
work of Intelligent Sonic Agents - NOISA. NOISA is an in-
teractive music system designed to monitor the performer’s
engagement and respond in autonomous ways in order to
maintain it [26]. NOISA functions in three diﬀerent stages:
ﬁrst, it monitors physical activity in the performer, then
estimates the current level of engagement, and ﬁnally re-
sponds whenever it considers it is necessary to do so. To
deﬁne what actions to consider in the response module, ﬁrst
the authors elaborated a portfolio of two second-long move-
ments that were considered as idiomatic gestures, as shown
in Figure 7. Once the performer is experiencing high lev-
els of engagement, his/her actions are recorded in confor-
mity with the overall properties that rule the portfolio of id-
iomatic gestures [27]. Afterwards, the gestures are labelled
with handle data, current estimated engagement and au-
dio properties of the event. NOISA retrieves these musical
actions once the monitored engagement reaches low levels
of attention. As the responses are based in rules of what
we consider ‘idiomatic’ for our instrument, these counterac-
tions will always comply with an style appropriate for the
sonic and physical characteristics of NOISA instrument.
In relation to the composition process of NOISA Etude
#1 and #2, the authors borrowed the motivic through-
composition technique, which is a methodology of com-
position from the common-practice period, also known as
thematic development . The authors crafted the pieces by
expanding the small in-built idiomatic gestures into longer
musical phrases and ultimately in various sections; guar-
anteeing cohesion, aesthetic interest and appropriateness of
the writing for the NOISA instrument. Figure 8 illustrates
the NOISA Etude #2 composition score. Both pieces have a
detailed score, using a custom notation comprised of graphic
boxes over a timeline, indicating position of each slider over
time [32].
In the case of NOISA Etude #3 the exploration of id-
iomatic writing practice shifted the unique characteristics of
NOISA instruments into a more established musical iden-
tity. The soundworld of the piece is determined by the
individual characteristics of the NOISA, which are emerged
from dynamic processing of musical timbre and mixed with
live electronics. The real time performance of this idiomatic
composition allows the musicians to blend the NOISA in-
struments and live-electronics, so that the sound of each
instrument is merged together into a complex, but tightly
mixed texture. In a performance situation, NOISA is treated
as a solo instrument, ampliﬁed and processed in real time

work of Intelligent Sonic Agents

studio-recording session of the piece Etude #3, which is ex-
ecuted as a manner of a musical theme. The piece is further
developed into a ternary form A-B-A with contrasting char-
acter between the ﬁrst two and a third section, comprising
a recapitulation of the ﬁrst. Having both NOISA and the
live electronics communicating with variations of a theme
in a larger-scale form, has been deﬁned as thematic dialogue
by the authors.
4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Even though idiomatic composition is a generally under-
stood concept and a widely used idea, the research focusing
exclusively on the topic and its implications is remarkably
low in quantity. Rekindling a discussion about idiomatic
writing for new instruments seems appropriate after exam-
ining the crucial impact of speciﬁc repertoire in the develop-
ment of “old” instruments, such as the standard symphonic
acoustic musical instruments. Furthermore, the wide array
of current technological music interfaces provides a common
ground for a compositional approach in capacity of helping
these tools to have a meaning beyond a “short-lived expres-
sion of individualism” [18]. The construction of dedicated
repertoire for an instrument makes tangible the possibilities
of the device, encouraging other practitioners to perform it
and expand it, thus generating a broader communal impact.
In this paper we presented idiomatic composition practice
as an appropriate approach to develop dedicated repertoire
for a NIME, in which compositions consider speciﬁc NIME

aﬀordances for sonic, social and spatial interaction. The
works presented and discussed in this paper demonstrate
that the potential of idiomatic composition in new musical
instruments is a terrain fertile for further exploration, with
enough historical precedents to make it a viable option for
instrument development through repertoire. In order to cre-
ate a more deﬁned musical identity and enable a NIME to
evolve in forms and sound qualities, it is necessary to con-
sider building new repertoire for new musical instruments,
guided by the design principles of the instruments as well
as physical and sonic features.
Regarding the criteria to select the projects we presented
as examples of idiomatic writing for particular NIMEs in
this paper, it is important to clarify that these projects
were chosen not as a mature ﬁnalised example of idiomatic
composition, but rather as an initial demonstration of con-
sidering interaction aﬀordances during the compositional
process. It is perhaps too early to measure the amount
of potential success of the projects explained, or if they will
indeed promote the construction of a signiﬁcant amount of
repertoire for the instruments involved. A practice of com-
position that is based on what is idiosyncratic for the new
instrument is not widespread in the NIME community so
far, which is precisely what we have focused on promoting
in this paper. We also believe that further encouragement
is needed to shift the emergence of a repertoire for new
instruments into a practice. As suggestion for promoting
this practice, it is feasible to carry out call for works and
even commissioned pieces featuring idiomatic writing for
new musical instruments. A second suggestion would in-
volve encouraging interface makers to release their projects
with documentation aimed speciﬁcally to recreate the in-
strument in other contexts, facilitating the construction of
new repertoire by other practitioners.
It is important to mention that in addition to serve as a
compositional framework, an idiomatic approach can also be
a design principle. New instruments for musical expression
can be molded to respond sonically in various diﬀerent ways,
therefore multiplying the potential of a new sound outcome
encloses closely the physical characteristics of a new de-
vice. In the Network of Intelligent Sonic Agents (NOISA),
for example, the architecture of the instrument inspired the
sound interaction, the response module (through idiomatic
gesture storage and retrieval), and ﬁnally composition of
the pieces themselves. It is up to discussion as well if apply-
ing idiomatic composition principles into new instruments
can encourage a piece being judged by how the composition
actually takes advantage of both the physical and sonic re-
sources of the new device, as suggested by Randel in ref-
erence to the acoustic counterparts [20]. While an opinion
on this issue can be formulated, only the observation and
research through practice in a larger study can give a clear
understanding on this matter.
A secondary discussion arises when wondering if the semi-
otic charge of the word interface shall be compared, or even
replaced by the term instrument when referring to new
music devices. Idiomatic writing has its take on this dis-
cussion by surrounding the term instrument with a tight
instrument-outcome connection, going beyond the ideal of
a considering the object as a tool for a particular function
(musical expression, in this case). Idiomatic composition is
impregnated into the evolution and standardisation of an
instrument in such a way that poses new challenges that
can potentially transform the performative approach and
even expand the expressive dimensions of the entire instru-
ment. Standardisation of new instruments, however, can be
a controversial matter in its own right. A potential question
arises when evaluating if the current pace of technological
178
development, capitalist modes of production, and a cultural
aﬃnity towards immediacy represent prohibitive factors to-
wards the establishment of musical repertoires. Would this
context represent a critical setback for a general model of
idiomatic composition in NIME community? We believe
that considering idiomatic practices means new possibili-
ties could come into being in the NIME community. The
whole historical course of idiomatic approach provides solid
evidence that building and maintaining repertoire for new
musical instruments is not only a feasible road for survival
but also potentially crucial for shifting the implications of
self-determinism into progressive and communal thinking.
