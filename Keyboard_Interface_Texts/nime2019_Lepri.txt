ABSTRACT
The emergence of a new technology can be considered as
the result of social, cultural and technical process. Instru-
ment designs are particularly inﬂuenced by cultural and aes-
thetic values linked to the speciﬁc contexts and communi-
ties that produced them. In previous work, we ran a design
ﬁction workshop in which musicians created non-functional
instrument mockups. In the current paper, we report on
an online survey in which music technologists were asked
to speculate on the background of the musicians who de-
signed particular instruments. Our results showed several
cues for the interpretation of the artefacts’ origins, includ-
ing physical features, body-instrument interactions, use of
language and references to established music practices and
tools. Tacit musical and cultural values were also identi-
ﬁed based on intuitive and holistic judgments. Our discus-
sion highlights the importance of cultural awareness and
context-dependent values on the design and use of interac-
tive musical systems.

1. INTRODUCTION
Social and cultural environments inﬂuence how we inter-
pret and shape the material world [7]. Wenger introduced
the notion of community of practice: a group of people who
share a common interest or activity and that belong to a so-
cial structure that reﬂects shared histories of learning [33].
Being part of a community does not simply imply the ac-
quisition of speciﬁc skills. We also inherit “the same set
of understandings, expectations, signiﬁcances and meanings
that are characteristic of that community” [10].
While discussing the “De-Scription of Technical Objects”,
Akrich argues that designers “express a scenario of the de-
vice in question - a script out of which the future history
of the object will develop” [1]. Akrich suggests that a large
part of the work of innovators is that of inscribing a vision

of the world (e.g. predictions on behaviours and norms)
into the future artefact.
In the context of instrument design, it is possible to ar-
gue that a luthier transfers into a music technology speciﬁc
cultural values [24]. Instrument makers envision for their
instruments contexts (e.g. music venues and schools), aes-
thetics (e.g. musical languages) and behaviours (e.g. per-
formance techniques). Musicians can also be considered as
inﬂuential vectors through which musical values are con-
veyed within communities. Diﬀerent musical communities
might then develop diﬀerent values inﬂuencing the develop-
ment and use of music tools [17].
In this paper we aim to gather evidence of the presence of
musical values in instrument prototypes. In particular, we
are interested in exploring whether observers with music
technology experience can work out the background and
values of an instrument designer based on photos of the
instrument and descriptions of how it works.
In a previous study [22] we ran a design ﬁction workshop
in which musicians active in diﬀerent musical contexts were
invited to sketch non-functional instrument mockups “as if
by magic”. We then organised an online survey in which mu-
sic technologists were asked to speculate on the background
of the musicians who designed the particular instruments
based on a few pictures and a short description. In this
paper we examine how our participants discovered musical
values while analysing both the ﬁctional musical designs and
the discourses related to their functioning and purposes.
After covering relevant literature on the topics of culture
and values in NIME research and value sensitive design,
we will introduce the online survey “From Magic Machines
to Musical Instruments” and the analysis of its main out-
comes. Finally, we will present our ﬁndings, discussing the
implications of a value-rational approach to NIME design.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Culture and values in NIME research
NIME is concerned with creating new instruments, prin-
cipally but not exclusively using digital technology. The
NIME community also embraces certain cultural and aes-
thetic values (although with wide variance across practition-
ers) whose identity is the topic of ongoing conversation [17,
6, 28]. Finally, NIME prides itself on its multidisciplinarity,
including its parallel roots in HCI and arts practice [27].
None of the three aforementioned statements is an in-
evitable consequence of any of the others. Even as speciﬁc
technologies are inscribed with values from their creators
[1], digital technology does not itself necessarily explain the
aesthetic values of the community. The inﬂuence of HCI
on NIME might appear to have an aesthetic component, as
second-wave HCI theories of information ﬂow share a lan-
guage with notions of musical expression as communication
[17, 16]. However, a full accounting of NIME values depends
122

Suono (CS), Plucker (PL), NonStopSound (NS), SonicAlarm (SA) and Stochastico (ST)
on many non-technological factors, including repertoire [16],
pedagogy [26] and performer skill [15].
This paper does not intend to resolve longstanding de-
bates about what values are (or should be) found at NIME.
Rather, we examine the ways in which an individual de-
signer might express their own values through making, and
what cues an observer would then use to recognise them.
2.2 Value discovery in HCI
Within HCI, one of the most recognised methodologies for
the translation of stakeholder views and values into techni-
cal design decisions is Value Sensitive Design (VSD) [13].
VSD can be deﬁned as “a theoretically grounded approach
to the design of technology that accounts for human val-
ues in a principled and systematic manner throughout the
design process” [13, p.64].
A key feature of value sensitive design is the sourcing and
identiﬁcation of potential values. A working deﬁnition of
value within VSD is: “what is important to people in their
lives, with a focus on ethics and morality” [13, p.68].
Although value-driven research is often concerned with
moral and social values (e.g. sustainability, democracy and
inclusivity) [32], various research approached the discovery
of stakeholders’ values based on more culturally-speciﬁc and
user-centred processes [5]. Our work is oriented towards
these kinds of mediation in order to explore patterns of ex-
perience and meaning-making [18] related to the engage-
ment with music technology. We are therefore interested in
the exploration of values as situated knowledge embedded
into subjective perspectives and practices [31].
In particular, our paper focuses on the discovery of values
[20]: a practice generally associated to the initial phases of
values-led inquiries [19].
3. STUDY DESIGN AND ANALYSIS
3.1 Previous design ﬁction workshop
Design ﬁction has been deﬁned as “the deliberate use of
diegetic prototypes to suspend disbelief about change” [23].
The narratives that an artefact conveys are not just about
the imagined device and its functionalities [3], they rather
contribute to “the creation ofcultural objects, allowing them
to act as prompts for a story we tell about ourselves ” [2].
In a previous study we ran a design ﬁction workshop in
which musicians active in diﬀerent musical contexts were in-
vited to imagine not-yet existing musical instruments. Par-
ticipants were therefore invited to build mock-up instru-
ments that work as if by magic . The purpose of the work-
shop was to produce cultural artefacts [2, 14] through craft-
ing activities. We were therefore interested to explore how
subjective musical values and cultural mindsets would be
transferred into a future technology.
We avoided tool kits, electrical components, sensors and
software units. We instead privileged mundane and every-
day objects (e.g. cardboard, paper plates, masking tape,
twine and metal wires, straws and toothpick): by sidestep-
ping materials that could resemble existing designs and func-
tionalities we aimed to free the participants and facilitate
the emergence of subjective values and purposes.
During the workshop we collected a set of information on
the musicians’ instrumental backgrounds, musical practices
and aesthetic preferences. Moreovoer, once musicians ﬁn-
ished building the prototypes the we invited them to present
the artefacts and explain its functionalities.
Our work draws on the work of Kristina Andersen and it
can be considered a variation of the Magic Machine work-
shops [2, p.30]. For a detailed explanation of the As If By
Magic workshop methodology and ﬁndings see [22].
3.2 Artefact selection
For our survey, we then selected six prototypes (Figure 1)
based on both the physical properties of the objects and
the musical background of their creators. The following
artefacts, identiﬁed along with the background of its creator
and its intended function, were included:
•AntennaLele: jazz - guitar (and bass) player with
a strong engineering and sound and music computing
background - ukulele-like instrument with a bendable
neck that can be used to “shape melodies and har-
monies”;
•CorpoSuono: classical - keyboard player with inter-
ests in contemporary composition and a few experi-
ences in the use of technology for music performance
(e.g. synth) - organ inspired instruments with tubes
ﬁltering the air that can produce complex timbre;
•Plucker: classical - guitar player with no experience
in music technology and instrument design - wearable
(glove like) polyphonic instrument with inside strings
to be manipulated with one hand to control pitches
and volumes;
•NonStopSound: EDM - producer and performer of
alternative electro-pop music with a background in
music technology and expertise in instrument design -
playful instruments based on a box containing a plate
and two balls, sounds are by tilting the box making
the balls and plate interact with each other;
•SonicAlarm: electroacoustic - composer and per-
former interested in contemporary electronic music
and improvisation with a strong engineering background,
interface design skills and no instrumental background
- wire-based instrument to be attached to both upper
and lower limbs that produce sound via the interac-
tions between its attachments;
•Stochastico: free improvisation - sax performer en-
gaged with free improvised and experimental music
with no music technology or instrument design exper-
tise - percussive malleable instrument equipped with
many diﬀerent tools and materials for sound genera-
tion and exploration.

3.3 Survey design
We ran an online survey targeting musicians and technol-
ogists with experience in musical interface design. We re-
cruited the participants using academic mailing lists (NIME
and SMC) and social networks. We aimed to see if respon-
dents could discover musical values through the prototypes
and link them to speciﬁc aesthetics and communities.
Survey participants reviewed an image of each ﬁctional
instrument and a short description of it provided by its cre-
ator 1. For each artefact, the descriptions were assembled
by quoting the creator’s interview (artefact presentation)
during the ﬁctional design workshop (audio recordings man-
ually transcribed). While selecting the quotes we aimed to
compose descriptions that could brieﬂy address the follow-
ing topics: (i) prototype functioning and performative tech-
nique, (ii) envisioned musical purposes and aspirations, (iii)
aesthetic and stylistic attitudes.
The survey asked the following open questions: “What
kind of musical style/genre do you think the musician plays?
Why do you think that?” and “What instrument(s) do you
think this musician plays? Why?” . Each participant was
presented with 3 of the 6 artefacts (balanced random order).
After completing the survey, participants were required
to provide information on their musical and technical back-
grounds. This allowed us to get an understanding of their
musical activities and training, style(s) of music they are
engaged with, STEM and design training and instrument
design expertise.
3.4 Survey Analysis
The survey was open for one month and we were able to
involve 22 participants: 5 female, 16 male and 1 no declared
gender. The range of participants’ age is 24-62 (mean 35).
Almost all the participants declared to have experience in
the design of musical instruments or interfaces (19) and to
use music technologies (20). Almost half of them attended
the NIME conference at least once (10).
We analysed the collected data following a thematic anal-
ysis methodology based on coding [9]. We adopted a data-
driven (inductive) approach: looking for patterns, similar-
ities and correlations while analysing the data [29]. We
conducted ﬁve iterations of coding. From open coding to
category formation each concept earned its way into the dis-
cussion by repeatedly being present in the “row” data [8].
Based on the collected data we could also analyse in more
detail respondents’ musical and technical background:

sional (8), none (2);

•Years of music practice : between 5 and 10 (1),
between 10 and 20 (11), more than 20 (8), none (2);
•Musical training : instrumental performance (12),
computer music (including electroacousitc, sonic arts
and live electronics - 3), composition (contemporary
and traditional - 2), other (music production, instru-
ment design and music theory - 3), none (2);
•Main musical activity: piano performance (4), gui-
tar performance (4), instrument design (4), computer
music (composition and performance - 4), brass per-
formance (2), multi-instrument player (2), violin per-
formance (1), composition (1);
•Main genre: classical (4), electroacoustic (3), EDM
(3), experimental (3), jazz (2), improvisation (2), pop
(1), rock (1), metal (1), folk (1), punk (1);
4. FINDINGS
4.1 Guess accuracy
Overall, our participants were rather successful in guessing
the genre/style of the artefacts’ creators: 44% of answers
were correct, and a further 27% partly correct. 12% of
answers were incorrect, 9% made no attempt, and 7% of
answers were oﬀ-topic. On the other hand, participants
were less successful while imaging the instrument played
by the prototypes’ authors: only 20% were correct, 21%
partly correct, 40% were incorrect, 13% made no attempt,
and 6% of answers were oﬀ-topic. We did not ﬁnd any
correlation between musical or technical background of the
survey respondent and accuracy of their guesses.
Responses we label as “partially correct” present some el-
ements associated with the designer’s background, without
clearly identifying a community, genre/style or instrument
that could be directly linked to the declared background of
the musician that designed the ﬁctional artefact. Responses
of this sort might identify broad musical areas (e.g. tonal
music), reference speciﬁc contexts (e.g. ensemble, labels
and musicians) or point to some of the musical tools char-
acteristic of speciﬁc genres/styles. Partially guessed com-
ments also often refer to family of instrument (e.g. wind
instrument) or identify an instrument/genre that has been
declared as “secondary” by the creator of the artefact.
4.2 Motivations
Considering respondents’ answers on why they guessed a
particular background, we identiﬁed several themes (Figure
2). Sometimes participants did not provide any motivation
for their guesses; during our analysis we created a no mo-
tivation category. These data were obtained based on the
quantiﬁcation of our codes. Due to the presence of diverse
themes within the same input, occasionally the same re-
sponse has been coded multiple times (max input length =
109 words, average codes per input = 1.2).
Musical values and interests - While motivating their
replies participants tended to introduce abstract concepts
often related to musical values and interests. Most frequent
comments of this kind include references to the ideas ofcon-
trol, unpredictability and instrument agency. SA2:“Electro-
acoustic. The fact that the designed instrument does not
allow full control would be hated by any other kind of mu-
sician” - ST:“Percussion instruments, because this chaotic
logic of random sounds is closest to a percussionist set.”
Notions such as manipulation and ﬂexibility were often
mentioned. ST:“It looks like the kind object you would de-
vour with your hands, and you are looking at your hands
2Abbreviations refer to artefact names; see Figure 1
124
Figure 3: Percentages of the participants’ genre/style guesses for each artefacts.
with satisfaction as you manipulate and you hear the re-
sults of that tactile control.” - AL:“Maybe improvised mu-
sic. Try to merge a sax and a double bass sounds like a solo
improviser who wants to expand his/her possibilities with an
instrument that can be changed.”
The identiﬁcation of compositional attitudes and interests
towards experimentation were also common. ST:“This ob-
ject seems like something a composer would create, not nec-
essarily a instrumentalist/musician. The temporary feeling
of it lends it self to degrade over time, providing more kinds
of tones to the composer.” .
Music notions and theories - Other recurrent themes
emerged from our analysis are related to the presence of
both music theory notions and spectromorphological con-
ceptions of sound. PL:“The main parameters the musician
seems to be interested in are pitch and volume. They men-
tion the timbre/general sound of the instrument, but don’t
seem to interested in exploring and modifying its timbre or
sound texture ... ” - AL: “I think the person is a singer
because they long for melodies AND harmonies of a com-
plex nature, and the voice on its own is very simple.” - NS:
“it couldn’t play any rhythmic style, probably only could to
make eﬀects with low attack sounds...”
Communities and practices - While discussing the ﬁc-
tional objects, participants tended to refer to musical prac-
tices typical of speciﬁc communities (e.g. orchestra). We
also often found allusions to inﬂuential musicians, narra-
tives and tools associated to particular artistic contexts.
CS: “Classical. Conceptually, they are thinking of large en-
semble performance and collective sound generation.” - PL:
“They also seem to be interested in polyphonic music, mov-
ing several voices to make chords, I interpret that kind of
like Bach chorales...” - PL: “Clear Hugh Davies nerd here,
probably really into kid 606 and the idea of katzenclaviers
but would never build an actual one” - CS: “The form of
the object reminds me of several indigenous percussion in-
struments...” - AL: “Maybe they are a sad church musician
... It sounds as if they are yearning for the structure of
“melodies” and “harmonies” (all of which traditional church
music provides) but in a completely other sound world ...
(rather than singing the soprano line the whole time).”
Use of language - The use of language found in the de-
scription of the artefacts was often interpreted as a relevant
cue. For instance, this emerged in regard to the metaphors
used to express musical practices and intentions. ST: “Def-
initely something abstract and modern. For instance, not
a classical player ... Mainly based on comments such as ‘I
usually do ... shapes of sound’ suggests they are used to
thinking about novel instruments and the language is more
conceptual and not precise ... (And for instance classical
musicians, tend not to always be that creative.)” Alterna-
tively, speciﬁc terms were identiﬁed as markers. Thus inter-
preted as powerful hookups towards speciﬁc musical com-
munity. NS: “Synths, and production - if you are talking
‘production’ you are talking recording and if you are choos-
ing your sound in production, typically not live instruments
so yup, sticking with EDM.”
Gesture and body interactions - Participants often
considered the gesture and body interactions implied in the
artefacts or stated by their authors. PL: “Guitar: ‘the way
you stroke a certain string can alter the pitch depending on
how much pressure you use on it.’ A subtly of guitar play-
ing, not a major interaction.” - PL: “Clarinet, but with
strong background in piano. They have a sense of the im-
portance of touch and pressure...” - PL: “Guitar and bass,
because of the strumming and plucking gestures the instru-
ment induces, keyboard synthesizers, because of the idea to
press something to produce the sound...”
Artefact features and mentioned tools - Artefact
features such as shape, functioning and accessories were of-
ten used to decode the prototypes, generally by compar-
ing them with existing musical instruments and tools. CS:
“Wind of some sort ... they are looking to mechanise wind
instrument tone production.” - ST: “The percussive aspects
of the object make me think maybe a drummer has made
this. I do not think a wind or read player (any mouth in-
strument) made this.” - ST: “Possibly a guitarist. Applying
strings to a oblong body is guitar-like.”
Finally, the musical tools mentioned in the description of
the instruments were often used to identify the genres and
instruments associated to the background of the object’s in-
ventor. NS: “I think the musician likes or makes electronic
music. A synth and randomness has been mentioned. Could
also play some other instrument.”
The most frequent themes used to discuss genre/style
were abstract values and musical notions followed by sit-
uated/embodied practices and tools. Less referenced are
those themes linked to the artefacts’ interactions and phys-
ical features. On the other hand, the instrument guesses
were often directly motivated by the prototype’s aspect,
conﬁguration and material aﬀordances. Musical values and
notions where less frequently introduced and references to
practices, communities and language rarely appeared.
4.3 Guesses for each artefact
Figures 3 and 4 show the percentage of guesses for the
targeted genre and instrument, grouped into categories of
genre and instrument. Participants mainly considered the
AntennaLele to be created by a jazz musician. Speciﬁc mu-
sic notions (e.g. melody, harmony and chord) and values
(i.e. variety and ﬂexibility) were often associated to this
genre. AL: “Jazz, Electronic, they want a ﬂexible mold-
able instrument”. For the instrument guess, the musician
has been often imagined as a double bass player due to the
similarities with the artefact form.
Corposuono has been mainly interpreted as created by
a classical musician. The reasons given were mostly music
theory notions and practices linked to the classical culture
(e.g. large ensemble and chords). Many participants sug-
gested that the musician should be a wind instrument player
due to artefact’s structure and functioning. CS: “A wind
instrument. Because of the conﬁguration of the prototype” .
125
Figure 4: Percentages of the participants’ instrument guesses for each artefacts.
The Plucker was often linked to the classical genre, mainly
in reference to the traditional music notions expressed by
the creator while presenting the artefact (e.g. pitches and
notes). PL: “Classical/Jazz, because of the importance of
pitch and the organ reference”. The instruments mentioned
in the prototype description (i.e. organ and french horn)
were often associated to the classical domain and often par-
ticipants imagined the designer to be a wind instrument
player. However, various participants identiﬁed the cor-
rect instrument based on the gestures and interactions men-
tioned by the musician.
NonStopSound has been associated to diverse genres. Ex-
perimental and electroacoustic due to the indeterminacy
linked to the sound production technique, and EDM due
to the language used to describe the object. On the other
hand, most participants recognised the musician instrumen-
tal background. NS “Maybe modular synth or a high level
dedicated audio programming environment ... The way she
describes playing seems indeterminate so perhaps has not
received a formal musical training”.
Due to the originality of the artefact conﬁguration and the
discourse on instrumental agencies and chaotic behaviours,
respondents associated SonicAlarm to electroacoustic and
experimental genres. SA “I imagine some kind of experi-
mental/noise electronic music, because of the randomness
he’s seeking. Also because it would mix music with some
performance that would involve human body through walk-
ing or throwing things” . For the same reasons the artefact
has been often interpreted as invented by a performer of
electronic devices (e.g. synth, laptop or DIY instruments).
Finally, Stochastico has been often related to experimen-
tal contexts (including free improvisation, contemporary
and alternative genres). The motivations provided often
referred to the precarious nature of the instrument and the
particular language used to describe the object. ST “Dis-
cussion of ’sculpting’ sound is suggestive of electro-acoustic
music styles, rather than of mainstream diatonic concerns”.
Many participants imagined the musician to be a percus-
sionist due to the structure and functioning of the artefact.
5. DISCUSSION
Our ﬁndings suggest the presence of various aﬃnities be-
tween the themes and designer backgrounds. For instance,
instrumental agency, unpredictability and exploration were
often considered as electronic and experimental concerns.
The same applies to interests in timbre manipulation and
abstract musical thinking. On the other hand, values such
as control and ﬂexibility and references to traditional music
theory were often related to classical and jazz domains.
Interestingly, these tendencies seem to be mainly related
to cultural and aesthetic attitudes rather than the designer’s
experience with music technology. Our participants often
associated the same set of musical values with designs pro-
duced by musicians with very diﬀerent technological skills.
For instance, artefacts such as SonicAlarm (electroacous-
tic composer with an engineering background), NonStop-
Sound (alternative EDM producer with a background in
instrument design) and Stochastico (sax player active as
free improviser with no music technology expertise) were
often associated to the same set of values and interests (e.g.
unpredictability and timbre exploration).
However, in this paper we are not interested in proposing
any explanatory model of any particular individual’s mu-
sical values or interests. We acknowledge that our sample
of 22 music technologists is likely not representative of the
music technology community as a whole.
One of our main points of discussion relates to the overall
ability of the survey respondents to discover the multiplicity
of cultural sources and musical practices in the designer’s
background. One example of this sensitivity is provided
by NonStopSound. By looking at the general picture, the
stylistic musical inﬂuences identiﬁed across all respondents
somehow summarises the proﬁle of the artefact’s creator
(i.e. active in the context of experimental electro-pop who
performs using custom designed instruments and synths).
While considering the particular backgrounds of our par-
ticipants and responses provided, we did not ﬁnd any dis-
tinctive trend (e.g. in regard to speciﬁc musical backgrounds
or technical expertise). However, by analysing the informa-
tion collected, it is possible to deduce that the majority of
our participants are knowledgeable or expert music technol-
ogist active in speciﬁc communities of practices for a con-
siderable period of time (i.e. for 10 years or more).
The involvement into particular communities of practice
implies “ways of learning - of both absorbing and being ab-
sorbed in - the culture of practice” [33, p.169]. Studies on
human learning indicate that “people pass through several
phases in the learning of skills” [12, p.167] Novices mainly
act on the basis of predeﬁned rules and best practices. Ex-
perts, drawing on intimate experience and personal perspec-
tives, balance standard procedures with intuitive behaviours
and holistic judgement [11].
We suggest that our research provides the possibility to
engage with this type of knowledge: context-dependent val-
ues emerging from situated practices and communities. This
is supported by various participants’ comments that we
could identify. PL “This person seems like a classical mu-
sician ... There is something familiar to me about how
this person seems to think of the sounds ‘altering with your
hands’, ‘altering the pitch depending on pressure’ ... I sense
that I speak a similar language to this person, musically, and
my own background is strongly classical. So I feel this is a
classical family member.” In this context, we therefore in-
terpreted this kind of correlations as related to empathetic
dynamics rather than rational/deductive processes.
Considering the genesis of new musical instruments through
the perspective of mediation [4, 21] it is possible to argue
that new design often re-mediate physical properties and
cultural paradigms already associated to existing devices.
Magnusson argues that “what new instruments translate
from earlier technologies are not simply the simulation of
126
an interface, but a whole constellation of embodied con-
texts” [25]. Within this constellation we also include the
values, imaginaries and concerns inherited from communi-
ties of practice and cultural heritage.
This paper aims to highlight that, besides technical exper-
tise, the design of a music technology entails the materiali-
sation of purposes, assumptions and values. These are situ-
ated factors, emerging from speciﬁc communities, contexts
and cultures [30]. As stated by Akrich “technical objects
have political strength” [1]. NIME research often focuses
on the design and evaluation of musical instruments, some-
times with unstated cultural assumptions which may derive
as much from the researchers themselves as from a target
musical community. A culturally-aware approach for the
design of musical interactive systems might want to clarify
the inﬂuence of speciﬁc musical backgrounds and cultural
environments, thus framing the context-based point of de-
parture and identifying mindsets, attitudes and objectives
according to speciﬁc set of values and interests.
