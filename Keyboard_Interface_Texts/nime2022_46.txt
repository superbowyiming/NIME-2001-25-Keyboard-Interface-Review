ABSTRACT
While the value of new digital musical instruments lies to a large extent in their music-
making capacity, analyses of new instruments in the research literature often focus on 
analyses of gesture or performer experience rather than the content of the music made 
with the instrument. In this paper we present a motivic analysis of music made with 
new instruments. In the context of music, a motive is a small, analysable musical 
fragment or phrase that is important in or characteristic of a composition. We outline 
our method for identifying and analysing motives in music made with new instruments, 
and display its use in a case study in which 10 musicians created performances with a 
new large-scale digital musical instrument that we designed. This research illustrates 
the value of a musicological approach to NIME research, suggesting the need for a 
broader conversation about a musicology of NIME performances, as distinct from its 
instruments.

Introduction
“Where words fail, music speaks”. - Hans Christian Andersen
Every year at NIME new instruments are performed. Practice-based research, in which 
performances and compositions form a core part of the intellectual contribution, is 
well-established at NIME [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. However, musicological analyses of music 
made with new instruments feature far less in the NIME literature, with evaluations 
more often focusing on the experience of performers, audiences or other stakeholders 
[6]. While musicological analyses may be inappropriate for some NIME research, such 
as short-term investigations with non-functional instruments or technology probes not 
intended for music making [7] [8], we argue that in the context of new instruments 
that are intended for performance, much can be learned from adding musicological 
performance analysis to the evaluation methodologies commonly used at NIME [9]

including thematic analysis [10] and cataloguing gestural interaction when a 
participant encounters a new instrument [11][12] [13], all of which involve capturing 
data via a range of methods including recording, field notes, interaction logs, 
interviews and questionnaires.
Musicology is a broad term [14], encompassing amongst other things music theory and 
analysis, music history and ethnomusicology; the field grapples with tensions between 
text and practice, between musical and social factors, and with persistent debates over 
what music should be privileged for study. Aside from scores and performances, 
instruments are also an important area of musicological study [15] [16] [17]. With 
limited space in this paper, we cannot do justice to the breadth of the field. Rather, we 
propose that analysis of NIME performances provides a different set of intellectual 
perspectives and insights compared to HCI-derived or practice-driven methods more 
commonly used to evaluate NIME instruments. In this paper we begin from a specific 
and limited subset of music analysis, motivic analysis, focusing on patterns of musical 
sound as distinct from the physical movements that performed them. While motivic 
analysis is commonly found in traditional score-based music analysis, the non-score-
based context of our study perhaps has more affinity with the field of performance 
studies [18]. 
The techniques in this paper are intended to complement, rather than replace, other 
established forms of NIME evaluation, and might serve as a modest starting point for 
deeper conversations about the analysis of music performed with new digital musical 
instruments (DMIs).
Background
Idiomatic music and new instruments
Far from being a blank slate, all instruments are embedded with scripts [19] that 
encourage certain types of music-making and discourage others. As a result of the 
instrument’s physical affordances, composing with an instrument can result in 
idiomatic music [20] [21] [22], music optimised for an instrument and made up of 
“ready-made sequences” and “characteristic patterns that cannot be predicted by 
grammatical rules alone” [20].
What is idiomatic to perform with new instruments has not yet been defined [21]. 
Musical patterns can be shaped by idiomatic gestures [13] [23] or by patterns of 
thought promoted by music programming languages [24].

In the context of DMIs, because the designers’ ideas of music are embedded in the 
instrument, instrument building has been compared to composing [25], and 
performing with someone else’s instrument has been likened to performing their 
composition [26]. The same principle holds to a certain extent with any instrument, 
even traditional acoustic ones: to perform an instrument is to engage in an artistic 
conversation across time and distance with its creator/s.
However, the specific way idiomatic patterns manifest in composed or performed 
repertoire has received less attention. Examining musical motives that performers 
employ when playing an instrument can offer clues about what kind of music is 
idiomatic to an instrument and why.
The musical motive
In the context of music, a motive (or motif) is a small, analysable musical fragment or 
phrase important to or characteristic of a composition [27]. As “the smallest structural 
unit possessing thematic identity” [28], a motive can be any element of music. Table 1 
shows examples of elements of western music, any of which could form part of a 
motive.
Table 1: Some western music elements
Our method of motivic analysis
We developed a method of motivic analysis for examining music and performances 
created with new instruments.
New instruments commonly have no notation system, or one that captures a limited 
subset of the instrument’s salient musical features. Rather than examining notated 
scores, which has long been common practice for musical analyses of established

repertoire, our method of motivic analysis examines the audio of the performance. 
Therefore, our method is also applicable to studying improvisation.
Given that a motive is an element of music that is characteristic of a composition, 
selecting the motives for motivic analysis is not a catalogue of all elements of music 
present in the performance. Rather it is a catalogue of the elements that are 
characteristic to the performance. We identify the motives in a 2-step process. We first 
catalogue all elements of music present in the performance. From this catalogue, we 
select only elements that are characteristic of the performance to become the motives 
for use in our motivic analysis. The question “would the performance be recognisable 
as the same performance without the inclusion of this element?” helps us identify 
which elements are motives of the performance.
Identifying motives is not an either-or process. Many conflicting motives may be 
simultaneously present and equally characteristic of the performance. The 
juxtaposition of conflicting motives may be a motive in itself. Following the process of 
motive identification for all performances results in a codebook of motives that is 
comparable like any other data set. 
Case study overview
The remainder of this paper presents a case study that demonstrates how our method 
of motivic analysis can be used to examine music made with new instruments.
We hypothesised that the physical design of a large instrument would influence what is 
idiomatic to perform with the instrument. We hypothesised that we may see physical 
performance patterns that trend across performers (regardless of the resulting tones) 
which may influence the tone selection of composers performing with the instrument.
To test these hypotheses, we updated the design of the large DMI from a previous 
study [29]. To create a data set for comparing performances to determine the influence 
of physical design on the performances created, we gave half the participants one 
tonal layout and half the other tonal layout of our DMI.

Hardware and software
Constructed of PVC pipes, the DMI features 20 performable pendulums that can swing 
up to 90 degrees forwards or backwards. Each has a textural pattern of raised rings 
(shown in Figure 2) inspired by the Latin-American güiro and an embedded analog 
accelerometer sampled at 22.05kHz, with several kilohertz of usable analog 
bandwidth. Collectively the accelerometers connect to 4 Bela mini [30] embedded 
computers running Pure Data [31].

Sound design
The DMI is tuned to the western scale of C# melodic minor with 10 lower register 
tones (C#1 to E2) and 10 higher register tones (G#3 to B#4). The sound design, 
adapted from Chair Audio’s Tickle Instrument [32], features Karplus-Strong string 
synthesis [33]. 
The lower register tones feature a clear fundamental frequency and sound like a 
synthesised electric guitar, meanwhile the higher register tones contain more 
inharmonic partials for a bell-like quality.

Striking the instrument with a mallet or hand results in a staccato (short) tone. 
Striking the pendulum or coupler (Figure 2) results in a clear tone whereas striking 
the support beam or instrument frame results in a cacophonic combination of the 
instruments’ tones. A drone (sustained tone) is performed by tilting a pendulum. The 
timbral quality and decay of the drone changes according to the pendulum angle: the 
accelerometer angle changes the feedback coefficient of the Karplus-Strong algorithm. 
At an angle somewhere between 45 and 90 degrees, the feedback coefficient becomes 
greater than 1, producing an unstable system where the drone grows over time, 
becoming chaotic and distorted as it is clipped by the digital system, finally 
disintegrating into broadband noise.
The instrument is polyphonic up to 20 voices. The staccato strikes and drones can be 
performed simultaneously, including on the same tone. Figure 3 demonstrates basic 
techniques and sounds and shows an example performance with the instrument.
Tonal layouts
The study instrument was created in two different tonal layouts: A and B (shown in 
Figure 4). For the duration of the study, half the participants received tonal layout A 
and half received tonal layout B. This way, the performances created with layout A 
could be compared to those created with layout B, because performing the same 
physical performance gestures on each version of the instrument would result in

different tones. On layout A, the lower register tones ascend left to right on the lower 
tier, and higher register tones ascend left to right on the upper tier. On layout B, lower 
register tones ascend in a zig-zag pattern on the instrument’s left side, and higher 
register tones ascend in a zig-zag pattern on the instrument’s right side. 
Study Design
Participants
An open call on social media invited musicians to create performances with a new 
instrument for an online concert as part of a study. All 10 respondents that were 
available took part in the study: 4 women, 3 men and 3 gender-fluid people, whose 
ages ranged from 28 to 49. While all participants have a formal western music 
background (shown in Table 2), and are established composer-performers within the 
experimental electronic music scene of London, their primary instruments and styles 
vary.

Method
As we were interested in comparing performances created by musicians familiar with 
the instrument, we designed the study to take place over 3 sessions. During each 
session, the musicians privately engaged with the study instrument for 1 hour. They 
were asked to create compositions in response to creative prompts (shown in Table 3), 
and perform each composition twice to ensure that they were indeed composing rather 
than improvising. Performances and interviews were video and audio recorded. The 
musicians were told that the final 3 minute performance would be broadcast on an 
online streaming concert.
Table 3: Creative prompts
Data collection and analysis
The analysis was primarily conducted by the first author, in consultation with the 
second author. The audio of the recorded interviews was automatically transcribed 
using the online service otter.ai with manual corrections. The interview data was 
analysed following a thematic analysis methodology [10] that took both an inductive 
(from the data) and a priori approach [34].

The performance videos were additionally analysed following our aforementioned 
motivic analysis method. 
Outcomes
The thematic analysis codebook (shown in Appendix 1) features 964 coded segments.
Figure 6 shows the outcome of the motivic analysis of the 3 minute concert 
performances.
We argue that the motives that make up idiomatic writing for this instrument are those 
that appear in over half the performances: the juxtaposition of high and low registers 
(9 performances); melodies created by alternating between 2 tones (7 performances) 
and extended drone/s in the lower register (9 performances).
Here we combine the thematic and motivic analysis of the 3 minute concert 
performances to explore the factors that resulted in the instrument’s idiomatic writing.

Melody
The juxtaposing of low and high registers is a motive of 9 concert performances.
Participants may juxtapose lower and higher registers as influenced by their musical 
backgrounds. P1, whose primary styles are electronic, new psychedelic and ambient, 
said “If I had a keyboard or guitar pedals or something like that, I would normally have 
a low note playing off against a high melody and drones. Stuff like that”.
The melodic alternation of 2 tones is a motive of 7 concert performances. This is 
interesting because the thematic and interaction analysis offers no data on this 
happening, nor that participants consciously composed performances that feature 
alternation of 2 tones. Therefore without the motivic analysis we would not have been 
aware this was a trend in the performances.
Harmony
The motivic analysis of intervals of two pendulums played simultaneously either as 
strikes or drones reveals that across all performances no specific intervals trended 
more than others.
Tone colour
Extended droning in the lower register was a motive of 9 concert performances.
All 10 participants included drones in their concert performance. The drone was P1 
and P3’s favourite aspect of the instrument. P1 commented “If I had to do one thing, it 
would be that.” 
A section of P9’s concert performance is made up solely of drones. She commented “I 
think I've made synthscapes that have that same kind of expansive, rolling, slow feel”. 
P8 commented that they enjoy “spacing out to drones” in general, not just when 
performing with the study instrument. 3 participants (P1, P2, P5, P9) were specifically 
drawn to the edge-like interactions [35] in the drone, exploring the edge of the 
sustained tone disintegrating into ‘chaos’ (broadband noise), while 6 participants (P1, 
P2, P4, P5, P9, P10) spoke of finding the ‘sweet spot’ in the drone, the point of 
sustaining the drone to their desired timbral quality.
But why are extended low drones a motive that forms idiomatic music for this 
instrument, and not extended high drones? P1, who performed layout A in which the 
higher register is on the upper tier, commented that performing the higher register 
drones requires more effort than the lower register drones. However the additional

performances
13
effort to perform upper tier tones does not explain the trend of participants preferring 
extended low drones over extended high drones because on layout B, upper register 
tones are equally dispersed across both tiers.
The thematic analysis suggests that the participants simply like the sound of the lower 
register tones, and the drone allows for exploration of various timbres within each 
tone. P1 said he enjoys “the ambiguity of these [low drone] sounds, because it's got so 
many tones mixed in. The amount of variation just in that small space is really 
interesting”. P9 commented “I like the really big resonant bass sounds”. P7 
commented that the lower register tones “fits better” with the “physicality” of the 
instrument.
The relationship between instrument layout and melodic motives
When comparing the motivic analysis to the instrument tonal layout assigned to each 
participant, we noticed that all 3 participants whose concert performances feature the 
melodic motive of at least 3 ascending or descending tones in order of the scale were 
assigned layout A, in which the tones ascend left-to-right along each tier. Similarly, of 
the 4 compositions that feature melodies made up of at least 3 minor thirds in order, 3 
were performed by participants that were assigned layout B, in which tones on each 
tier ascend left to right in minor thirds.
Discussion
The value of motivic analysis in our findings
Comparing the motivic analysis to the instrument tonal layout revealed that the 
physical layout of tones influenced the melodies featured in performances. Performers 
are more likely to compose melodies constructed from tones located on the lower tier 
and pendulums located adjacent to one another.
With the addition of motivic analysis, the discoveries made through thematic analysis 
gained more dimensions and clues to their origins. For instance, while the thematic 
analysis revealed the musicians enjoy performing drones, the motivic analysis revealed 
what kinds of drones the participants performed. 
When we returned to the thematic analysis after doing the motivic analysis we noticed 
that no interview data discussed the melodic alternation of 2 tones, that we identified 
in 7 performances. Therefore motivic analysis has the potential to identify aspects of

14
performances that performers themselves may not be aware are in or characteristic of 
their performances.
The case for a musicology of NIME performances
Numerous musicological perspectives have been written on instruments and music 
technologies past and current (e.g. [17] [36] [37] [38]). In a reversal of the situation 
with pre-20th-century Western art music, ethnomusicological perspectives are 
arguably more established in the NIME community than traditional music-theoretical 
analyses of NIME performances. Additionally, music-theoretical analysis has been 
applied to electronic music genres both popular and experimental (e.g. [39][40][41]
[42]). 
In this paper we argue for elevating the music performed on NIMEs as a subject of 
research rather than as a separate siloed element of annual conferences. Creating a 
musicology of NIME performance would draw together those already bringing such 
analytical perspectives to NIME [43][13][22][44] while encouraging a closed loop 
between performances and written publications. This stream of work would sit 
alongside, but distinct from, gestural and experiential analyses deriving from HCI 
traditions. No single analytical approach can be appropriate to all NIME music, nor 
can any single analyst claim a definitive interpretation of artistic works in the 
community, so a musicology of NIME ought to emerge from an inclusive conversation 
amongst researchers, scholars and artists.
Limitations of our method of motivic analysis
Our motivic analysis methodology has some limitations. First, it is based in western 
music. In this study, all authors’ and participants’ musical backgrounds are in western 
music, so it made sense to construct this motivic analysis around the elements of 
western music. However, we acknowledge that both participant selection and analysis 
method could be seen to continue a post-colonial tradition of elevating a western 
musical canon. We hope this methodology inspires future work that uses motivic 
analysis of new instrumental performances within a variety of cultures and genres.
Second, a musical motive is an element deemed characteristic to the composition. It 
follows that the integrity of a motivic analysis relies on the subjective judgement of 
what is important to the composition. In our methodology, motive selection and motivic 
analysis were both executed by us without consulting the participants. Although it is 
common for music analyses to be conducted by someone other than the composer or

performances
15
performer, the process is subject to influence from our musical judgments and biases 
[45].
Third, a motivic analysis focuses on music made regardless of physical gestures and 
techniques performed with the instrument and could therefore be conducted using as 
source material any method of recording including video, audio or music notation. The 
varying nature of notation and scores for new instruments could make comparing data 
difficult. Meanwhile, coding motivic analysis from audio or video recordings has its 
own limitations, for instance audio compression may influence perception of dynamics.
Conclusions
This paper suggests the value of traditional musicological analyses of the music made 
with new instruments, taking as a case study the motivic analysis of performances on a 
large-scale digital musical instrument. Using motivic analysis in conjunction with 
thematic analysis, we discovered insights into the relationship between the 
instrument’s physical design and musical performances. We found that on our 
instrument, the physical layout of tones influences the melodies that are characteristic 
of each performance.
Motivic analysis has the potential to identify aspects of the music that performer-
composers may not have been aware of themselves. This research illustrates the value 
of a musicological approach to NIME research, suggesting the need for a broader 
conversation about a musicology of NIME performances, as distinct from its 
instruments.

Ethics Statement
The study was reviewed and approved by the ethics board of Queen Mary University of 
London (ethics approval reference #2393) prior to research commencing. While the 
instrument is large in size, it is lightweight and therefore does not put participants at 
risk of injury, hence the ethics facilitator deemed the study extremely low risk. 
During the first study session, the investigator introduced the participant to the study 
instrument and explained that the instrument is safe to perform as long as the

participant does not attempt to climb the instrument. Having seen the instrument, the 
participant confirmed that they would participate in the study and completed a consent 
form as required by the institution ethics board. All participants were subsequently 
shown various performance methods for performing the instrument, and told that all 
techniques are optional, as is all participation in any aspect of the study. 
The travel costs for all participants to attend all sessions were paid for from the first
