Abstract
Documenting and sharing research output is essential to con-
struct the critical discourse on new music technology. Documen-
tation feeds the knowledge and the values with which to evaluate
and discuss current achievements and musical creations as well
as to plan for the future. Besides publishing our research in con-
ferences and journals, sharing research materials and outcomes
like software, hardware, instruments, and datasets is important.
This allows others to use the latest technology and improve it.
For this purpose, the repository is increasingly commonly used
by researchers and artists to store and share their works. How-
ever, creating repositories does not follow a clear and organised
structure like the one we find, for example, in papers. The het-
erogeneity of repositories makes it hard to use both practically
and for analysis. Although the variety and differences of research
products in the field of new musical technologies are obvious,
we believe that defining repositories with common guidelines
could significantly improve the critical discourse in this area.
This issue has been discussed at the NIME conference through
workshops and papers. In this article, we want to continue this
discussion and propose a flexible repository template to organ-
ise and present research materials and outcomes in the field of
musical technologies research.
The article provides a short and focused review of how reposi-
tories are currently used at the NIME conference, with special
attention to the platforms used. Based on this study, we introduce
a repository template that will be applied to case studies. We hope
this proposal will encourage further discussion and advancement
on this issue and, at the same time, support and facilitate the
creation of new repositories.

1 Introduction
Music technology research is a multi- and interdisciplinary field
focused on developing original multimedia technologies for mu-
sic and sound contexts. In this field, researchers design, develop,
and use new software (applications, firmware, libraries, etc.),
hardware, systems that combine software and hardware (such as
digital musical instruments), tools, and datasets, which are either
the results of the research itself or the tools used to conduct it. Be-
sides the new technological devices, the outcomes of this research
encompass new music, sound and performative applications, pos-
sibilities and understandings, as well as musical creations. The
results are usually shared through dedicated conferences, such
as the Digital Audio Effects (DAFx)1, New Interface for Musical
Expression (NIME),2 Sound and Music Computing (SMC),3 Audio
Mostly (AM),4 and dedicated journals, such as Journal of New
Music Research (JNMR),5 Organised Sound,6 and Leonardo.7
The community of researchers and the outcomes in this research
area are constantly growing. For example, participation in these
venues is overall increasing. Fasciani and Goode have shown
that the literature has grown steadily since the NIME confer-
ence began in 2001. Since 2005, there have been over 100 new
authors each year, reaching a peak of 202 new authors in 2014
[12]. Although outdated, Hamadicharef’s analysis [ 14] shows
that the DAFx conference has consistently grown in both litera-
ture and participation (at least until 2009). Mauro and colleagues
[17] outlined that participation in the SMC conference, especially
in terms of submissions, has not shown a significant increase but
remains steady.

To trace the content and values of this research, we must re-
fer not only to the bibliographic content but, more importantly,
to the critical discourse. Every community, conference, journal,
or network engages in a critical discourse where the research
values are embedded and from which its outcomes are produced
and generated [3, 8]. The bibliographic record is only one element
(a cause and product) of this discourse, which more generally “is
a continuous process of exchange which includes [...] the instru-
ments we make, the conversations we have, the relationships we
maintain, trends that emerge, and so on” [3, 8].
The need for documentation that goes beyond just publishing
an article (which is still an important document) has been ad-
vocated to promote critical discourse [3, 8]. Calegario discusses
documentation to promote the replicability of a Digital Musical
Instrument (DMI). Although he doesn’t use the term “discourse, ”
he explains that replicability (or the documentation that allows
us to replicate a tool) helps us avoid “reinventing the wheel”
and enables us to explore under-explored areas of the design
space or adjust designs that have been considered interesting or
“successful” [8]. Documentation helps preserve research results
with their development, updates, and long-term engagement. In
other words, documentation allows the critical discourse and the
research field to grow and mature.
Furthermore, as proposed by Bin [3], in order to unfold a critical
discourse, the documentation should be collaborative by relying
on collective input, ongoing to support continuous development,
flexible to adapt to changing circumstances, open to allow acces-
sible and unrestricted contributions, and complete to ensure that
all contributions are fully represented.
Based on these criteria, public repositories are the most com-
mon way to create and maintain research documentation and
related materials [8, 9, 13, 18]. In 2016, a workshop was held at
the NIME conference to promote NIMEhub. The project aimed to
build a design ecosystem focused on NIME, where instrument
parts could be easily shared worldwide. It was planned to achieve
this through the systematic use of repositories [ 18]. Unfortu-
nately, this workshop has not produced any public and available
outcome.
To follow these efforts, to encourage documentation, its mainte-
nance, and thus the sharing and development of research in this
specific area, in this article, we propose a repository template that
follows and promotes the five characteristics of documentation
[3] as well as the documentation features already defined in the
literature. The goal is not to create a standard (which would limit
the flexibility of documentation) but rather to provide a simple
and adaptable architecture with requirements and essential infor-
mation that can help create and use repositories for the various
and heterogeneous parts of the research.
In the next section (section 2), we will present the results of a
brief and focused literature review measuring the use of reposi-
tories and the main platforms used to archive and share research
outcomes. In section 3, we will introduce our GitHub-based repos-
itory template proposal, and in the section 4, we will present two
case studies demonstrating the application of this repository.
2 Reviewing the use of repositories
This article examines how repositories are used exclusively at
the NIME conference. The overall idea is to analyse which plat-
form is the most common one and how this platform has been
recently used. We conducted two separate but related reviews.
In the first review (section 2.1), we studied how often reposito-
ries are mentioned and the main platforms used for them, from
the first conference in 2001 to the latest in 2024. In the second
review (section 2.2), we studied the processes involved in creat-
ing and reusing repositories in the proceedings of the last three
conferences (2022, 2023, and 2024). This second study is based
exclusively on the platform, resulting in more iterations from the
first review.
2.1 Review A
Methodology. To conduct the first review, we started with the
combined bibliography of all NIME proceedings in .bib format.8
In the first step, we downloaded all the papers in .pdf format. To
do this, we created a simple Python script that extracts the “URL”
field from each bibliography entry (the download link for the
paper) and automatically downloads the files.9 In total, we down-
loaded 2202 articles. For each article, we conducted a keyword
search for terms such as “repository, ” “github, ” “gitlab, ” “bitbucket, ”
and “google drive. ” The goal of this review is to count how many
articles include these words each year at the conference.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. We focused our research
on the keywords “repository, ” “github, ” “gitlab, ” “bitbucket, ” and
“google drive. ” The first keyword helped us understand how repos-
itories are generally used, while the others showed which specific
platforms are popular. The terms were chosen based on each
platform’s popularity. This popularity can be observed on the
Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_
source-code-hosting_facilities (last accessed: 2025-04-29). We
also confirmed this by checking user numbers reported by each
platform. GitHub is currently the most popular, with over 150 mil-
lion developers (https://github.com/about). GitLab follows with
more than 50 million users (https://about.gitlab.com/company/,
last accessed: 2025-04-29), and Bitbucket had around 10 mil-
lion users as of 2019 (https://www.atlassian.com/blog/bitbucket/
celebrating-10-million-bitbucket-cloud-registered-users, last ac-
cessed: 2025-04-29). This data is also supported by Stack Over-
flow’s Developer Survey conducted in May 2022, 10 as well as
Stack Overflow’s Tag Trends service.11 Since cloud storage ser-
vices can be used as an alternative of repositories, especially when
multimedia files are more important than software or source code,
we have also included Google Drive. Google Drive has been one
of the most widely used cloud storage platforms for many years
[30].12

NIME-conference/NIME-bibliography (last accessed: 2025-02-02)
9We developed a Python script to download articles and extract data. The code
can be found in this repository at https://github.com/alessandrofiordelmondo/mtr-
repo-rev [1]. It is inspired by the NIME proceeding Analyzer created by Fasciani
and Goode [11, 12]. We recommend using this analyser for more extensive reviews.
The NIME proceeding Analyzer is available at the following link: https://github.
com/jacksongoode/NIME-proceedings-analyzer. Our review is more focused and
smaller in scope, so we needed a simpler, custom solution.
10According to this survey GitHub is the most popular platform, with
87.02% of users using it for personal purposes and 55.93% using it for
professional purposes. GitLab is the second most popular, with 20.51% of
users using it for personal purposes and 28.9% using it for professional
purposes. https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-

Results. Figure 1 illustrates the keyword analysis results. The
term “repository” is used more often (in 13 papers last year),
especially in relation to the GitHub platform. In 2023, the word
“github” appeared at least once in 52 out of 99 papers; in 2024, it
appeared in 40 out of 93 papers.

itory,” “github,” “gitlab,” “bitbucket,” and “google drive”
within the all NIME proceedings (from 2001 to 2024)
2.2 Review B
Methodology. To understand in detail how repositories have
been used in NIME, we further analyse the use of the platform
GitHub in a smaller sample consisting of the papers from the
last three years (2022, 2023, and 2024) and in which the “github”
word is present. We extracted a total of 115 papers. These papers
have been analysed to contextualise the use of the keyboard and
thus find if the repositories belong to the presented research
(i.e. whether it is created in the function of documenting and
sharing that specific research) or belong to other research (i.e.
reused or analysed in the paper). We often find cases where
authors provide a repository where readers can download and
view the research materials and outcomes: e.g. “Schematics, CAD,
and code for this system is distributed in the following repos-
itory, such as https://github.com/aschmidt99/LorentzLapBrass”
[21], “The code is all available on GitHub (https://github.com/
yannseznec/periodInstrument) and a video can be viewed on
YouTube (https://youtu.be/vOGdXnA11Is)” [22]. In these cases,
we label the repository as “Created. ” In other cases, authors use
repositories made by others to present the current state of the art
–e.g. “Apart from the long tradition of network music tools in Su-
perCollider (e.g. HyperDisCo13, the Republic Quark,14 [...]” [29]–,
to reuse code and software– “An open-source machine listening
plug-in for Unity15 is used to extract audio features continuously
from the Quest microphone” [24]–to adapt the code–e.g. “The
patch used in the instruments is an adaptation of Yann Seznec’s
Granular Sampler16” [20]– and in rarer instances, also as tools for
analysis –e.g. as caption of a Figure: “Figure 1. GitHub commits
to the ChucK core repository from 2010 until February 2024”.
[25]. In these cases, we label the repository as “Reused. ”

Finally, in the last step, we collected the mentioned repositories
to analyse a possible iteration of the same repositories and users.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. For this review, we consid-
ered only the papers from the last three proceedings since we
focused on the latest trends in repository use.
To contextualise the “github” keyword, we excluded the links
referring to GitHub’s web pages, usually in the form https://
username.github.io.17 These types of links are out of our scope
because they lead to real web pages that differ from the typical
use of the repository.
Results. Table 1 shows the number of papers that created new
GitHub repositories belonging to their research (“Created”), those
that used external repositories (“Reused”), and those that both
created and reused the repositories (“Both”) for each year.

2.3 Discussion
From these two short and focused reviews, we can conclude that
the use of repositories is continuing to grow, with GitHub being
the main platform for hosting them. This observation aligns with
broader trends beyond the NIME community and music technol-
ogy research, as shown by the previously mentioned resources
from which we extracted the research terms for the first review.
One of the second review’s most interesting findings is the use
of repositories created by others and included in new research
contexts. This data shows that repositories are essential tools
within the NIME community and, therefore, essential elements
of its critical discourse.

Another very interesting finding from the second review results
is that IDMIL (Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory
at McGill University) is the second most frequent user in Table 2,
and their T-Stick repository is listed with the most iterations in
Table 3. This data is notable because the T-Stick is probably the
longest-running NIME instrument, developed and maintained
since 2006, and probably the repository has played an important
role in such longevity.18
Finally, one thing that goes beyond the main focus of this analysis
but was still noticed when looking at the keyword “github” is
the increasingly common distributed structure of repositories.
These structures also relate to what was suggested in [8]. We see
repositories spread across multimedia platforms like YouTube
or Vimeo (e.g. [22, 28]), and we also find projects that are doc-
umented and stored using various repositories linked together
(e.g. [26, 27]).
3 Repository template
We propose a repository template as an adaptation of the Mul-
tilevel Dynamic Preservation (MDP) model, which is developed
for time-based media art conservation (already introduced in the
context of NIME [13]). The adaptation uses the studies regarding
replicability conducted by Calegario [8, 9] as guidelines, where
the organisation of materials and documentation was discussed.
In presenting the repository template, we will not go into the
more specific functions of the GitHub platform and Version Con-
trol System (VCS) tools, nor the low-level details of research
projects. The goal is to provide a high-level and flexible tool with
essential elements that can be used at different levels of expertise
and for a variety of projects. The main idea is to establish the
repositories’ key hierarchical and temporal structure with the
required information. To achieve this, we will focus on DMIs, as
they have an extensive structure which comprehensively repre-
sents new music technology research.
We present our repository based on four essential actions:
(1) Organise all materials and documentation
(2) Provide information about the project and how to use the
materials
(3) Track changes over time
(4) Promote sharing and collaboration.
3.1 Organise
Organise all project materials and documentation.
18The T-Stick’s GitHub repository has been created in 2020.
When working on a project, especially when finished, we of-
ten end up with many different types of materials, such as videos,
pictures, notes, source codes, and multimedia files. To organise
everything, we can break down the structure of the project into
four main parts: the physical part (hardware), the logical part
(software), the knowledge part (the multimedia content or train-
ing data for systems like AI), and the documentation.
We can structure the root folder of the project considering these
parts:
• software: Contains the source code, compiled code, firmware,
and software.
• hardware: This includes information about the physical
parts, such as microcontrollers and sensors, and files for
building the hardware (mechanical structure and electron-
ics), such as CAD files and 3D models.
• files: Contains multimedia files like audio and video and
datasets used by the software.
• documentation: Contains text, images, videos, instruc-
tions, and other data produced during the project.
These sections can be further organised with subfolders and
README.md files (section 3.2). Since uploading multimedia files
directly to GitHub is discouraged, it’s better to create distributed
repositories [8], use platforms like YouTube or Vimeo for videos,
SoundCloud or Bandcamp for audio files, and Google Drive or
Zeonodo for datasets, and link them back to the repository. This
approach can also be used to link other materials and documen-
tation, such as connecting software to other repositories. To use
a Git repository within a project, we can use the submodules
system provided by Git.19
3.2 Inform
Provide information about the project and how to use it.
GitHub’s About section provides the first level of information.
It is visible on the right of the repository’s main page and can be
filled out when creating a new repository or later by editing the
repository details. The section offers basic information, such as a
brief description of the project, a related website, and a series of
keywords.
To extend the information about the project, we use the README.md
files to describe and explain the project better, how to replicate
and use it, as well as to provide information about the reposi-
tory’s content. The README.md file in the root folder is the most
important. It should give an overall view of the entire project
and repository.
Our template suggests including these main sections in the main
README.md file:
• Abstract: A short but complete project description (e.g.,
DMI, code, study).
• Demo: Visual demonstration (image, gif, or video) to show
what the project looks like (required for tangible instru-
ments).
• Technical notes: A brief description of how the project
works, links to different parts of the repository and details
on any dependencies.
• Instructions: This section should explain how to use the
project (e.g., installing software, compiling code, or build-
ing an instrument). If the instructions are long, we can put
them in a separate file in an “Instruction” folder inside the
19Learn more about submodules: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-
Submodules (last accessed: 2025-02-05).
Toward a Repository Template for Music Technology Research NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia
Documentation folder. But the main README.md should
always link to these instructions.
Other sections could be added, such as “Contributions, ” “License, ”
“How to cite, ” “Funds, ” and “Acknowledgments. ” The first three
are especially important for promoting the project repository’s
sharing, collaboration, and openness. If they exist, they must link
to specific required files like LICENSE, CONTRIBUTION, and
CITATION.cff (section 3.4).
Additional README.md files can be added to the main subdirec-
tories to describe the specific content of each folder. Within the
software, hardware, and files subdirectories, the README.md
can list the folder’s specific content with information about de-
pendencies and requirements. The README.md within the Doc-
umentation folder can link to external documentation, such as
videos of performances and a bibliography or web references.
When there is a stand-alone instruction folder, the README.md
must be used to compile the exact instructions.
3.3 Keep track
Track changes over time.
To keep track of a project’s history, we recommend using Git’s
Tag function. Tags allow marking specific points in a repository’s
timeline to highlight key stages or versions in the project’s devel-
opment. The tag represents different milestones or versions of the
project’s progress. They help collaborators and users easily re-
turn to earlier versions, modify them, or reuse them if needed. We
recommend using annotated tags with clear and related names
(e.g. dmi-v1.0, dmi-v1.2, dmi-v.2.0, etc.) and short descriptions
(see the repositories in section 4).
We can also create Releases from tags, which are especially used
to package and share software versions with users, along with
any associated metadata (such as release notes, binaries, or other
assets).
Both tags and releases can be easily accessed from the reposi-
tory’s main page.
3.4 Share
Promote sharing and collaboration.
GitHub and the open-source community have created guides
to encourage collaboration and sharing repositories. 20 These
guidelines suggest adopting specific files and specifications so
the community can easily engage with projects. In the context of
music technology research, we recommend making at least three
of these files:
• LICENSE: Defines what third parties can and cannot do
with the project. We strongly recommend adding a license;
sharing a project can be more difficult without one.21
• CODE_OF_CONDUCT: Outlines expected participant
behaviour, helping to create a positive and welcoming en-
vironment. It also describes a) Where it takes effect (e.g.,
issues, pull requests, events), b) To whom it applies (e.g.,
community members), c) What happens if someone vio-
lates it, and d) How to report violations (refer to GitHub’s
open source guide for more details).
20The Open Source Guide can be read at the following link: https://opensource.guide/
(last accessed, 2025-02-05).
21To choose the appropriate license for a project, we recommend visiting the website
https://choosealicense.com/ (last accessed 2025-02-05).
• CONTRIBUTING: This file provides guidelines on how
people can contribute to a project. It invites third parties
to participate and can help build a community around a
project.22
To allow others to cite a repository in their work, the Citation
File Format (CFF), developed by Druskat [10] and fully supported
by GitHub, can be used. Creating a file named CITATION.cff in a
project’s root folder and including the necessary metadata makes
it easy to cite a repository. The CITATION.cff file can be easily
converted to BibTeX or plain text using a dedicated converter
[23], which GitHub also has built-in. If a CITATION.cff file is
added, a “Cite this repository” command will automatically ap-
pear on the right side of the GitHub page. External references
(e.g., software, repositories, articles, etc.) can be added to the
same file.

Figure 2 summarises the structure of our proposed GitHub
repository template for music technology research projects. The
template can be found at the following link: https://github.com/
CSCPadova/MTR-template [2].
The LICENSE file was created using the MIT License , which al-
lows unrestricted template reuse. The only condition is that if the
template is changed or further developed, it must be republished
under the same license.
For CONTRIBUTING, we used a template developed by Nadia
Asparouhova, published in the repository https://github.com/
nayafia/contributing-template and distributed under the CC0 1.0
Universal license . It includes essential elements for customising a
specific project’s contributing guidelines.
For the CODE_OF_CONDUCT files, we adopted the Contribu-
tor Covenant Code of Conduct v2.1 ,23 which GitHub and various
open-source communities also suggest. However, theCODE_OF_
CONDUCT can be customised as needed. Other examples are
the Django Code of Conduct 24 and the Citizen Code of Conduct ,25
which can also be used as templates.
Although the presented template was developed with DMIs in
mind (since they often include both hardware and software), it
can be easily adapted and scaled for different projects in the
music technology research field in general. An example is the
repository of the Python code used for the reviews in Section 2
[1].
4 Case studies
We present the template application with two DMIs presented
at NIME in 2020 and 2021: the Electronic_Khipu_ and Kanchay_
Yupana/.
The Electronic_Khipu_ [4, 7, 15] is an instrument that creates live
experimental sound by tying knots in conductive rubber cords.
Inspired by the ancient Incan Khipu, it goes beyond using the
device purely as a numerical system, transforming it into a tool
for new messages and sound narratives. The instrument uses
conductive rubber sensors as variable resistors, measuring ten-
sion each time a knot is tied.
The Kanchay_Yupana[7, 16] is an instrument used to produce mu-
sical rhythms. It is based on an Andean device called the Yupana,
a physical board similar to an abacus with carved geometric slots
for placing seeds or pebbles to perform arithmetic calculations.
The DMI has turned this instrument into a sequencer with digital
LDR modules in each slot, triggering sounds when the slots are
filled with seeds.
Like the technologies that inspired them, these DMIs comple-
ment each other during the performances. It is also important
to note, especially in this context, that these two instruments
are connected not only with ancestral Andean and Inca techno-
logical culture but also to new music technology research. The
Electronic_Khipu_ is inspired by the MIDI Melody Maker 26 and
uses elements from the Conductive String-based Arduino Mu-
sical Instrument.27 Similarly, the Kanchay_Yupana relies on a

Pure Data patch inspired by Jonatan Carrasco’s “Caja de ritmos”
tutorial.28 The goal of these instruments is to engage a critical
discourse by merging new music technology research with an-
cestral ones, and with the creation of the repositories, we want
to promote the continuation of this discourse.
The repositories of the instruments can be found at the following
links:
• Electronic_Khipu_ [5]
https://github.com/lpatriciacadavid/Electronic_Khipu_ .
• Kanchay_Yupana [6]
https://github.com/lpatriciacadavid/Kanchay_Yupana_ .
Like many DMIs, these instruments feature custom boxes with
hardware (a microcontroller, sensors, etc.) and software (firmware,
an Ableton Live project, and Pure Data patches). They also in-
clude audio files for use in performances. Building instructions,
concert media (photos and videos), and presentation materials
have been created and collected for both instruments.
The repositories include all the elements introduced in the tem-
plate: a hierarchical structure, the About section and a README.md
in the root folder, tags for tracking the versions,29 and the files
needed to share and promote the projects.
It is interesting to see how the more flexible parts of the repos-
itory template—those more specific to the project—were filled
out—for example, the creation of README.md files in each sub-
directory. The README.md files in the hardware, software, and
files folders simply list the “components” (software, hardware,
and multimedia files) with some metadata and dependencies.
Meanwhile, the Documentation folder’s README.md includes
external links related to video and bibliographic documentation
for the instruments. In this README.md, we also link the projects
and research which inspired the instruments. Essentially, in that
text file, we put all the documentation we prefer not to store
directly in the repository and which is distributed on other plat-
forms. In addition, we created an ‘instruction’ subfolder inside
the Documentation folder, which has a README.md file with
detailed steps on how to build and perform with the instruments.
Finally, the Electronic_Khipu_ repository demonstrates the use of
tags. For instance, one can switch between the nine-cord Khipu
version (khipu-v1-9s) and the five-cord Khipu version (khipu-1-
5s). The entire repository content automatically updates accord-
ing to the selected version.
5 Conclusion
With this article, we want to highlight the importance of reposi-
tories in the new music technology research field, especially in
the context of NIME. In creating a critical discourse and defining
this research area’s values and development paths, we need more
than just papers and conference participation—we need research
materials and documentation that can be reused, developed, and
analysed by a community. As seen in the reviews in Section 2,
repositories are increasingly used both to archive research and
to repurpose it in various ways. We noted many references to
repositories in the articles. This study continues a discussion that
began at NIME nearly 10 years ago [18] and has been carried on
(though not continuously) by the community [8, 9], emphasising
the importance of repositories for community building.

versions: one with nine cords and another with five.
Toward a Repository Template for Music Technology Research NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia
Overall, the contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) a systematic
literature review on the use of repositories in the context of NIME
conferences and 2) a template to harmonise archiving NIME con-
tributions. We believe a template, even if simple and flexible, can
extend this important discussion. It could also serve as a starting
point for both a structured use of repositories for creative and
analytical purposes and for encouraging future discussions. Who
knows—maybe in the future, we will conceive a flexible format
similar to that of a scientific paper, which, while dynamic in
structure (from Title to References), still has recurring elements
within it.
6 Ethical Standards
This paper complies with the ethical standard of the NIME confer-
ence [19] and does not present a conflict of interest. The project
propose an original template for creating repository in the con-
text of Music Technology Research. The paper presents two case
studies in which no human or animal participants were involved.
