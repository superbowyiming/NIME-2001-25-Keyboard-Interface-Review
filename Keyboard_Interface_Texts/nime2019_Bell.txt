ABSTRACT
The combination of graphic/animated scores, acoustic signals
(audio-scores) and Head-Mounted Display (HMD) technol-
ogy oﬀers promising potentials in the context of distributed
notation, for live performances and concerts involving voices,
instruments and electronics. After an explanation of what
SmartVox is technically, and how it is used by composers and
performers, this paper explains why this form of technology-
aided performance might help musicians for (spectral) tuning
and synchronization with an electronic tape. Then, from
an exploration of the concepts of distributed notation and
networked music performances, it proposes solutions (in con-
junction with INScore, BabelScores and the Decibel Score
Player) seeking for the expansion of distributed notation
practice to a wider community. It ﬁnally presents ﬁndings
relative to the use of SmartVox with HMDs.

1. INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS SMARTVOX?
SmartVox [4][3] is a distributed web application that delivers
and synchronizes audiovisual scores in the mp4 format to
the performer’s mobile devices, in compositions involving
up to 80 simultaneous performers such as in Le temps
des Nuages. Recent developments include the use of head-
mounted displays (HMDs) for technology-aided performance,
as in the pieces In Memoriam Jean-Claude Risset I
(Figure 1) and Mit Allen Augen, In Memoriam J.C.
Risset II(Figure 2).1

performance.
1.1 Technical implementation
SmartVox was developed in the SoundWorks framework.2
SoundWorks provides a set of services – such as synchro-
nization, network messages, distributed states, creation of
groups of clients – that aims to solve problems common to dis-
tributed and synchronized web applications centered on mul-
timedia rendering. The framework is written in Javascript,
with a server side based on Node.js. 3The SmartVox applica-
tion consists of two web clients, the player and the conductor,
that can be executed in any recent web browser on mobile
devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets) and laptops. The real-
time communication between clients is achieved through the
WebSocket protocol 4 The application is typically deployed

over a local area network, but it may also be used over the
internet.5
1.2 Composer’s Score Elaboration Workﬂow
The audiovisual scores (mp4 ﬁles) used in Smartvox are
composed in the Bach environment [1], a Max library for
real-time computer-aided composition. In this environment
(bach.roll or bach.score), each note of the score can store
metadata in its slot content (e.g. Path to a sample, automa-
tion curve...). This feature is used to control synthesizer
that creates the audio cues, directly from the notational
environment 6. Each separate part (one part per voice/in-
strument) of audiovisual notational material generated in
Bach is then recorded by screen/audio captures, in order to
be distributed and synchronized by SmartVox in rehearsals
and performance, as shown in the diagram below:
Figure 3: Score elaboration workﬂow.
1.3 Performer’s Perception
From a singer’s or instrumentalist’s point of view, SmartVox
provides simultaneously auditory (audio-score[2]) and visual
(animated notation) information, which facilitates the in-
terpretive and performative processes by recalling of the
performers’ separate parts, thus expediting the learning and
rehearsal process of a new work. This synergy between visual
and acoustic stimuli also enables spatial separation or move-
ment of the performers, and allows for the exploration of
unfamiliar musical materials (e.g. microtonal tuning, texts
in a foreign language).
2. SMARTVOX FOR MIMETIC ORCHES-
TRATION OF ELECTRONICS
2.1 Frequency Domain : Spectral Harmony
SmartVox was initially imagined as a tool that would help
choristers to tune with the electronics. In spite of its initially
loose synchronization capabilities, it quickly appeared that,
with singers of all levels, the system allowed for a precise
control of harmony in the context of choral music in particu-
lar.7The piece Smartvox8 (which has the same name as the
application) remains the best illustration of it capabilities
in spectral terms.
2.2 Time Domain: Rhythmic Precision
At IRCAM in January 2018, Benjamin Matuszewski im-
proved the synchronization possibilities of SmartVox by
implementing a client-side algorithm that puts back in sync
devices whose drift exceeds a certain threshold ([3], Chap-
ter 4.3). Thanks to this new implementation, it can now
explore a wide range of tightly synchronized musical situ-
ations. These new possibilities encouraged the author to

write rhythmical games between performers, taking advan-
tage of the cursor-type display of time, as in In Memoriam
Jean-Claude Risset 1,9 or sharper articulations, such as
the clapping game present throughout the piece Mit Allen
Augen, in memoriam J.C. Risset II.10
During the composition process, 11 the precise lining-up
and synchronization of live performers with electronics was
also improved by ability to useBach as a master over Ableton
: the bach.roll object displays notation in proportional time,
and outputs notiﬁcations of its playback status in real-time.
These notiﬁcations can be interpreted in Max For Live in
order to synchronize 1/ the notation for human players in
Bach and 2/ the electronics in Ableton Live 12.
2.3 Conclusion : Mimetic Orchestration
A great majority of the electronic material presented in
the Risset cycle 13 constitutes mimetic 14orchestrations of
the PRISM laboratory synthesizer, developed by Richard
Kronland-Martinet [6]. The recent improvement of SmartVox
in terms of synchronisation now allow more ﬂexibility for
musical expermentation of various sorts. In Das Hoheslied,
In Memoriam Jean-Claude Risset 3for instance, stu-
dents of HfMT Hamburg were able to sight-sing (for the very
ﬁrst time) passages which strikingly resembled the target
model.15
3. DISTRIBUTED NOTATION
3.1 Distributed Notation: Global Context
Composers and researchers increasingly acknowledge the
strong analogy which can be drawn between the traditional
‘score and parts’ musical practice led by a conductor, and
the modern distributed systems or web applications (MASD
[15] - SmartVox [4]), in which multiple clients coordinate
their actions by passing messages to one another. Con-
sequently many performance-oriented systems today (IN-
Score[7], SmartVox [4][3], Decibel [14] [13], Maxscore [12])
endeavor to distribute and synchronize each part of the score
on the performer’s devices (whether Smartphones, tablets or
laptops). The Tenor 2018 conference in Montreal revealed
to the author an interesting similarity between the Deci-
bel ScorePlayer and SmartVox, in the sense that the two
softwares are rather elementary solutions both converging
towards the score player performance-oriented paradigm,
whilst other notation packages (Bach, Maxscore, Symbol-
ist...) were also designed for more elaborate computer-aided
composition and real-time processes. SmartVox reveals itself
to be very eﬀective for this kind of setup by rendering the
score in the browser directly, without the need for installing
a client application. Thanks to cross-platform web tech-
nologies, the application works with any browser capable

device, and no installation is required by the client. The
node.js16/WebSocket architecture of SmartVox will hope-
fully inspire more composers, researchers and developers
to investigate the emerging musical practice of distributed
notation.
3.2 SmartVox.eu, Score Distribution over the
Web and Remote NMPs
With the exponential growth of the web, hostingSmartVox17
on the internet (i.e. on a remote server rather than a local
one) appeared as a necessity. However we demonstrated (in
Chapter 4.2 ‘Measurements of timing accuracy’ [3]) that,
although the synchronization of diﬀerent parts was quite
accurate in this way, local solutions remained safer (in the
same room, over Wi-Fi). Also, notwithstanding the fact that
SmartVox belongs to the realm of Networked Music Perfor-
mances, it became clear that its practical application falls
under the ‘local NMPs’ sub-category deﬁned by Gabrielli
and Squartini [10]. Indeed in the case of SmartVox today,
local NMPs still seem more viable, ﬁrst technically (because
of the unreliability of the internet in 2019), but also artisti-
cally speaking (because in a live performance the audience
presumably expects the physical presence of the artist [11]).
3.3 The ‘BabelBox’, a 0-conf Raspberry Pi So-
lution for Local NMPs
The author has shown evidence that SmartVox is suitable for
large scale projects such as le temps des nuages18 in which
eighty singers and musicians had their score synchronized
through the same network [3]. However, in the more inti-
mate context of chamber music (as in In Memoriam JC
Risset 1), the focus is slightly diﬀerent: the network load is
much lighter, which encouraged ﬁnding a minimal hardware
solution, in order to make possible rehearsals without the
physical presence of the composer or the mobilization of a
technician only to setup a network. Installing the server on
the performer’s computer remotely has often been successful
even with musicians unfamiliar with technology, thanks to
the ﬂexibility of the Node Package Manager (NPM), which
reduces the installation of SmartVox to a few command
lines.19This installation process nevertheless remained an
obstacle for the dissemination of SmartVox. In search of
a light plug-and-play dedicated system to be sent over the
post, the Raspberry Pi quickly appeared as the best option
to host SmartVox on an embedded system. node.js runs
on Raspbian, and SmartVox proved to be very stable on a
Raspberry Pi 3, so, once installed, the only two steps for a
0-conf deliverable hardware were:
•Setting up a static address for a dedicated router (e.g.
tp-link...).
•Starting SmartVox at boot.
This low-cost system (less than 65 €, for a Raspberry
and a router) now allows the sending of ready-to-use scores.
Once the system is power-supplied, all the performers need
to do is to join the dedicated Wi-Fi, and type the static IP
address of the server on their smartphone/tablet (i.e. for
16Server-side JavaScript, see: https://nodejs.org/en/

accessible through the following url www.smartvox.eu, and
can be accessed simultaneously from e.g., an iPad for the
ﬂute, Android tablets for piano and cello, and a phone for
the singer. A trailer of the premiere of the piece is accessible

the performers: 192.168.0.100:8000, and for the conductor:
192.168.0.100:8000/conductor). In January 2019, for the
performance of a pedagogical piece, The Super Mario
Babel Box. This small system was sent per post to the
Caen French conservatoire via BabelScores20, thus proposing
a rental of performing scores (separate parts) of a new kind.
During the rehearsals and performances, synchronization
prooved to be of great precision and download speed very
fast, in spite of the lightness of the low-cost system.
3.4 BabelScores, Inscore and SmartVox
The representation of time in the age of screen scores is
open to a wide array of solutions. In none-pulsed music
particularly, and in spite of the great conducting tradition in
chamber music and orchestral works, left-to-right scrolling
cursors distributed on the performers’ devices (as in the
Decibel ScorePlayer or SmartVox) seem a far more straight-
forward strategy to obtain tight synchronization in com-
parison to the bars and beats ‘encoding’ (quantiﬁcation by
the composer with or without the help of algorithms) and
decoding processes (a compromised interpretation by the
instrumentalist, between the rhythmic values written on the
page and the gestures of the conductor), inherited from a
scoring tradition, in which a regular meter was assumed.
If Bach is the favoured environment for the author’s own
compositions, INScore[9][8] might be of particular relevance
to extend the practice of distributed notation to a wider
community of composers and performers, through the wide
community of composers edited edited at BabelScores in
particular. INScore allows for the precise temporal control
of animated cursors in the graphical domain. Thanks to its
OSC support, it is possible to control the cursor’s position
via automations in Ableton Live 21. These animation can
be used for scrolling cursors over standard notation 22, and
the arm movements of a conductor can be replaced by a
bouncing ball23. These tools might be used, in combination
with the BabelBox, for highly demanding pieces in terms of
synchronization24, or as a tool for appreticeship of unfamiliar
idioms such as early music notation. 25
4. HEAD MOUNTED DISPLAYS
In Memoriam JC Risset 126, premiered in September
2018 at the Gaudeamus Festival (Utrecht), constitutes the
author’s ﬁrst experiment using head-mounted displays. By
simply displaying each part of the score over the heads of the
performers (for ﬂute and clarinet only), this piece revealed
interesting potentials, further exploited on a larger scale in
Mit Allen Augen, In Memoriam J.C. Risset II.
Just as traditional scores placed on a music stand, screen-
scores displayed on a tablet (for instrumentalists) or on a
phone (for singers) oblige musicians to look and orientate
their body constantly in the direction of the score. This
well-established convention of the classical concert setup
considerably limits the possibilities of staging music, in a
theatrical context for instance.
According to the performers’ feedback, head-mounted
setups provide a large and comfortable display, since the
20Babelscores (https://www.babelscores.com/) is an on-
line score database for classical contemporary music,
currently actively supporting the SmartVox project:

environment is still visible around the score, or through
the score in the case of holographic display (such as the
Aryzon headset for instance, see Figure 4). The performers
also showed interest in their ability to move freely on stage
oraround the audience.
Figure 4: Score display from the performer’s point
of view.
While awaiting more discrete solutions (such as Vuﬁne27
Glasses), invisible from an audience’s point of view, HDMs
open vast perspectives for further research, which could
expand even beyond the mere display of animated notation.
5. CONCLUSION
Initially conceived as a rehearsal tool for choral practices
almost exclusively [4] [3], recent use cases have demonstrated
that SmartVox is in fact better and more broadly described
as a distributed score player suitable to instruments as well
as vocalists with, or without electronics. If musical notation
remains a key concept for SmartVox, the notion ofNetworked
Musical Performance probably deﬁnes it more speciﬁcally.
With its promising use of distributed head-mounted displays,
SmartVox wishes to shift the focus from human-computer
interaction towards computer-mediated human interaction
and proposes an original interface for musical expression for
collective technology-aided live performances.
