ABSTRACT 
This article offers an overview of the technological 
advancements in traditional Korean music instruments, also 
known as Gugak. The projects detailed in this article show how 
sensors, physical controls, alternative designs and materials, and 
software devel opment can be used to enhance performance 
options and adapt to modern performance settings and needs. 
Although there are fewer Gugak NIME projects and research 
available compared to Western instruments, this genre has the 
potential to inspire various areas  of ongoing research, such as 
specialised signal processing, sensor applications, and 
interactive educational platforms. This paper is also the first 
review article that summarises the current state of technological 
advances and applications specifically f or Gugak instruments 
and musical genres.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 Although other forms of ‘national music’ genres exist across 
countries within East Asian cultures, the term ‘Gugak’ is 
specifically used to encompass the musical, cultural, and 
historical elements used within the Korean Peninsula. 
Throughout the formation and growth of the culture within 
Korea, there have been periods in history when foreign cultural 
elements from various countries were imported and absorbed. 
Influences from Chinese culture and Western cultural 
components have been  introduced, integrated, and then 
individualised to the Korean people’s needs and cultural 
evolution. However, there has been a gradual loss of Korean 
culture preservation and an increased favouring of the more 
recent influx of contrasting differing Western cultural elements 
and values. Institutionalised efforts to recover and re -establish 
traditional Korean cultural elements, such as Gugak [1], [2], [3], 
are continuously being. These efforts have acknowledged the 
changing technologically -heavy environment in which it 
competes [4], [5], and have adjusted themselves to fit within this 
modern context [6]. Modern Gugak has accommodated this by 
experimenting with digitalising Gugak timbre, recording 
methods, alternative musical instrument design and materials, as 
well as educational processes in order to support the changes 
within performance settings.  
 
This article will summarise many of the existing NIME projects 
within the Gugak community today and discuss future research 
and methods. It also serves as an overview and foundational 
source for other English -speaking researchers interested in 
Gugak or other East Asian traditional instrument modifications 
that require non-westernized technological methods. 
 
2. THE FOUR DEVELOPMENT 
CLASSIFICATION 
Current Gugak NIME projects can be grouped into four key 
development spaces, which expanded from the preliminary 
research and development of Gugak alternative  digital sound 
production methods via receiving and projecting acoustic sound.  
2.1 Receiving and Projecting Acoustic 
Sound  
Today’s performative and artistic setting has significantly 
changed compared to what was considered standard during the 
last century. Performance spaces have expanded into alternative 
spaces such as online, interactive, and outdoor venues [4], 
requiring acoustic instruments to adapt. The physical and 
acoustic design of Gugak instruments was not created to project 
the volume needed to fill today’s more extensive performance 
and fusion orchestration settings. Also, the growth of fusion 
orchestration, mixing Western instruments with Gugak 
instruments, created an issue of sound projection balance within 
these new ensembles. 
 
While Gugak -specific microphone techniques and placement 
have been researched (in particular [7] and [8]), several NIME 
projects have experimented with embed ding pickups onto 
traditional instruments for consistent amplified sound 
production. Pickups within these projects were either attached to 
an existing acoustic Gugak instrument, as in Seung -Gi Park’s 
electric gayageum [9], and Ajay Kapur et al.’s eHaegeum [10] , 
or inspired the creation of a new instrument developed with the 
intention of embedding amplification technologies. Oriental 
eXpress, led by Young -Jun Choi, developed the iHaegeum and 
iJanggu to prototype Gugak instruments with embedded piezo

disk pickups [10], [11], [12]. Dae-Hong Kim et al. removed both 
the physical resonant cavity and string s from its haegeum 
instrument design to allow the AirHaegeum to be a completely 
digital performative controller [11] [12]. Jae-Eop Yoo developed 
Arang-e [13], and Dong -Hyun Kim et al. created four electric 
Gugak instruments: the Supersound Gayageum [13], Geomungo, 
Haegeum, Ajaeng [14], and Janggu as commercial options for 
amplified Gugak instruments.  
 
2.2 Physical Instrument Design and 
Materials Affected by Added Amplification 
Technologies  
As seen in Choi [15], Kim [12],  and Supersound’s [13], [14] 
Gugak instruments, removing elements no longer necessary for 
the instrument’s function allowed for an organic physical 
redesign of these traditional instruments.  Due to the use of 
amplification technologies, such as piezo disks or 
electromagnetic pickups , the need for a physical acoustic 
instrument body was no longer required as they were replaced 
with digital libraries of instrument timbre  sound production. 
Without the functional need for a quality wooden resonant cavity 
(Figure 1), several Gugak NIMEs opted for alternative designs 
and materials that only maintained a skeleton frame for the 
purpose of prototyping new technology [16].  
 
a)   b)  
Figure 1. a) iHaegeum and b) iJanggu skeleton frame 
design allowed for technology prototyping   
 
Carbon Fiber is also widely used in projects like Arang -e [17], 
[18] and the Supersound instruments [19] due to its durability, 
weight reduction, consistent manufacturing methods, and 
excellent sound propagation material.  This lighter material 
allowed for more freedom on performance stages as they could 
be worn (Figure 2), rather than constricted to the traditional 
stationary sitting position [19]. The AirHaegeum [11] (Figure 3), 
utilised a 3D -printed plastic frame  to allow flexible design 
possible without considering traditional bowing placement, 
pegs, bridges, and string fixtures [11].  
 
 
Figure 2. These Supersound electric instruments 
demonstrate another example of the use of diverse 
materials and design compared to Figure 1  
 
Figure 3. AirHaegeum removed the physical strings and 
bow, causing a considerable change to the instrument 
design and materials 
 
Gugak NIME projects that maintained the original design of 
acoustic instruments have repurposed the optional resonant 
cavity for other functionalities (Figure 4). Some of them, like the 
eHaegeum, eJanggu [10], and Arang -e [15], have utilised the 
space to accommodate electrical components such as control 
units, boards, and batteries. 
 
a)  b)  
Figure 4.  a) eHaegeum created a housing cover for the 
open end of the instrument cavity b) Arang-e created a 
separate electronics module that could be inserted into the 
cavity space  
 
Although alternative designs and materials allowed for 
diversified performance controls and simplified instrument -
building methods, they do have some disadvantages. Altering the 
overall look and familiar design and materials of the instruments 
often introduces the debate of whether the instrument is an 
extension of the acoustic instrument or a completely different 
instrument merely inspired by it. For example, Lamtharn 
Hantrakul’s the Fidular project [20] featured a modular instrument 
system intended to represent many variations of Asia's two-stringed 
bowed transverse fiddles, including the Korean haegeum.  As seen in 
Figure 5,  this project would more likely be more accepted than the 
AirHaegeum [12] or Supersound’s instrument [19], which was created 
with the original instrument design in mind.  
   
Figure 5. Fidular has interchangeable resonant cavities, 
soundboard skin plates, string materials, and pegs that can 
construct twelve variations of two-string-bowed fiddles 
from around Asia 
 
2.3 Expanded Control Options 
Many of the above -mentioned Gugak NIME projects have 
included volume control in the form of a physical or digital dial 
as a necessary component of digital sound production control. 
Apart from volume control, some projects such as eHaegeum, 
eJanggu, Arang -e, airHaegeum, iJanggu, daegeum [21] and 
janggu [22], take the sound produced by the instrument through 
an intermediary stage. This stage allows sound effects and 
parameters to be added to the raw signal before it is projected. 
The controls for these sound effects and parameters are an 
assortment of knobs, switches, and buttons displayed on the 
instrument (Figure 6). They can be reprogrammable and trigger 
various visual and sound effects while playing, thereby 
diversifying the player's capabilities [10].

Bluetooth speakers and an onboard effects control unit d) A 
flat stone-like sensor apparatus with an accelerator and tilt 
sensor (used as a bow alternative) could be re-programmed

Interactive visuals controlled by Gugak NIME have been 
occasionally explored since Jin -Hi Kim’s electric geomungo in 
1998 [23], [24] . Choi’s iJanggu was repurposed from a 
performative musical instrument to a programable controller for 
various settings, such as interactive gallery installations and 
interactive contemporary dance performances [25]. Other Gugak 
NIME projects, such as Young-Mi Kim et al. (Figure 7) [26] and 
Deborah Kim  (Figure 8) [27], were initially created with the 
intention of using the instrument as a trigger for visual control.

2.4 Supporting Software Development 
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the 
development of digital instruments for producing non -acoustic 
sounds. This has led to continued research into recording 
practices and guidelines for achieving the timbre of traditional 
Korean Gugak instruments. A growing interest in expanding this 
genre of music into the digital world has led to more efforts to 
officially record Gugak instruments and the creation of virtual 
instrument libraries  [28]. For individuals who may not have 
access to Gugak physical instruments or players for their desired 
orchestration, virtual Gugak instrument library plugins for 
digital workstations (DAWs ) and mobile apps  were created by 
Oriental eXpress [15], Center  for Arts & Technologies Seoul 
National Universit y (CATSNU) [29], [30] , Kyung-Gook Min  
[31], Young-Joo Park et al. [32] provide accessible options.

The Gugak software examples discussed in this context 
showcase varying degrees of Westernized musical components 
instead of native Gugak parameters  (Figure 10). It is 
understandable why these applications utilize universally 
familiar Western concepts such as piano keyboards (Figure 9), 
step sequencers, and AKAI MPC -style pads  (Figure 10), 
considering their practical audience and use. However, there is a 
need for further exploration to create  genre-correct, yet 
understandable, inputs to accurately represent the Gugak timbre 
and genre parameters.

[33], [31] and [32] have demonstrated, in their respective 
projects, alternative options for mimicking live instrument 
performance parameters via mobile apps (Figure 12) while also 
including elements that educate users on Gugak -specific 
characteristics (Figure 11). Aside from these software -based 
education approaches, physical educational Gugak projects  
exist, such as Soo -Mi Kim et al., who created a physical multi -
instrument Gugak controller intended for children to familiarise 
themselves with their country’s traditional genre instrument 
timbre and music characteristics (Figure 13) [21]. Bo-Eun Kim’s 
interactive tuning corrective system (Figure 14) [22], was 
developed to target specific Gugak -related musical concepts. 
Although the se cannot be utilised directly to support 
performances, such projects encourage continued targeted 
research to fill the knowledge gaps within Gugak NIME. This 
allows for further globalisation, preservation, and diversification 
of the genre and expands the research of alternative forms of 
interaction and education.

3. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This article provides a summary of the current state of 
development and projects in Gugak NIME. It illustrates how 
Gugak NIME projects evolved once the development of Western 
digitalized audio techniques was reapplied to this ‘national 
music’ genre. The goal of solving acoustic amplification issues 
expanded into other fields of research, including em bedded 
pickups, external physical control options for sound, 
multidisciplinary performance mediums, and  alternative 
instrumental design and materials. We believe modern Gugak is 
currently in a period where it has drawn on foreign (Western) 
cultural and technical elements but has started to individualize 
them by developing systems and methods that fit the distinctive 
characteristics and needs of th e Korean musical genre. 
Ultimately, in order to further promote and preserve this fading 
genre, educating the new generation of learners is crucial [34]. 
 
Although demonstrating specific Gugak techniques and musical 
elements has been made more accessible with the rise and 
accessibility of video-formatted instruction and recorded 
excerpts, most of these materials for beginner non -professional 
audiences are created in the Korean language, therefore limiting 
the accessibility for foreign learners. Many platforms have been 
developed for Western instruments, such as the piano, featuring 
a physical interface and complementary educational software 
(seen in [35]); there has yet to be an educational platform that 
allows interactive modules that provide personalised feedback 
on the curriculum material. We will address this gap by 
proposing an inclusive and authentic application and recognition 
of Gugak musical characteristics and components within a 
responsive digital interface. 
 
The proposed Gugak education platform aims to implement 
effective subsystems that will enable novice learners to learn and 
self-correct Gugak musical features accurately while preserving 
the underlying cultural importance. While Western systems are 
familiar, they cannot fully encompass all aspects of the unique 
Gugak genre. By valuing the natural elements of Gugak, this 
alternative education approach will promote a new generation of 
performers who value the genre, thereby preserving this key 
Korean cultural element.
