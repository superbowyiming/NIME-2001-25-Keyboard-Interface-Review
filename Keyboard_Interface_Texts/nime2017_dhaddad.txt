ABSTRACT
We introduce a family of fragile electronic musical instru-
ments designed to be “played” through the act of destruc-
tion. Each Fragile Instrument consists of an analog syn-
thesizing circuit with embedded sensors that detect the de-
struction of an outer shell, which is destroyed and replaced
for each performance. Destruction plays an integral role in
both the spectacle and the generated sounds.
This paper presents several variations of Fragile Instru-
ments we have created, discussing their circuit design as
well as choices of material for the outer shell and tools of
destruction. We conclude by considering other approaches
to create intentionally destructible electronic musical instru-
ments.

1. INTRODUCTION
From burning pianos to smashing guitars, the act of de-
struction has become an impactful idiom of modern music-
making. From Rock’n’Roll to the artistic avant garde, per-
formers have employed destruction to create shocking spec-
tacle and stimulating sounds. In reaction to this trend,
philosopher Stephen Davies argues that destroying an in-
strument is wasteful and disrespectful to the instrument
[14] [15]. This view points to a common psychological phe-
nomenon where well-crafted and useful tools, such as mu-
sical instruments, are awarded an elevated status among
objects; some musicians even personify their instruments,
like BB-King and his guitar Lucy.
Interestingly, Davies’s argument resonates for the very
same reason that instruments destruction has persisted in
music-making. Watching and hearing destruction induces

visceral feelings in the audience unachievable through con-
ventional means, be it horror or glee, rage or release.Instrument
destruction ﬂouts the collusion between performer and audi-
ence [5],introducing immediacy and tension as the audience
tries to anticipate whether the instrument will survive or
be destroyed, pushing the boundaries between reality and
performance. It also introduces a uniqueness to the perfor-
mance as that instrument won’t appear again and there’s
probably not going to be an encore, so the show is essen-
tially over. At its most basic level, instrument destruction
is expression of senseless violence, while at higher level it
can represent a strong political statement and/or a unique
theatrical spectacle that can actually be“played”to produce
a somewhat controlled sonic manifestation.
This paper introduces a family of “fragile” electronic mu-
sical instruments designed to be “played” through the act of
destruction. Each Fragile Instrument consists of a replace-
able “sacriﬁcial” shell enclosing a sound-synthesizing circuit.
The circuit stays intact during the destruction of the outer
shell and generates analog sounds based on embedded sen-
sors. Destruction thus plays an integral part in both the
spectacle and sound of each performance. Since the shell
could be made from salvaged or recyclable materials, Frag-
ile Instruments deliver the impact of instrument destruction
without the waste of precious and expensive parts.

2. RELATED WORK
Intentional mistreatment of musical instruments was pop-
ularized by Rock’n’Roll and Punk musicians as a climactic
spectacle during live performance. Guitar sacriﬁces have
become the most iconic examples though a piano was re-
portedly the ﬁrst “victim”, set aﬂame by Jerry Lee Lewis
in the 1950s as he performed his hit “Great Balls of Fire”
30
[10]. Pete Townshend of The Who was the ﬁrst to smash
his guitar on stage in the 1960s [6]. Other artists introduced
new variations on guitar sacriﬁce, including Jimi Hendrix,
known to have smashed and burned his guitars, and Richie
Blackmore of Deep Purple, who smashed his ampliﬁer along
with his guitar [2]. Stage sacriﬁce also extended to other
instruments of the rock ensemble, such as the bass (Paul
Simonon from the Clash), the organ (Keith Emerson from
ELP) and drum set (Keith Moon from the Who).
Instrument destruction has found its way into a vari-
ety of other genres. In heavy metal Matteo Ravisio cites
the Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen and keyboardist
Christian “Flake” Lorenz of the German industrial band
Rammstein [14]. Acid Mothers Temple is one of the new
psychedelic rock bands whose unusual performances some-
times involve destroying older gear. The guitarist of the
alt-rock band Muse reportedly destroyed a record of 140
guitars over a single tour. But the most bombastic of all
may be the Japanese noise band Hanatarash, known for
their extreme and dangerous live shows; once a venue was
partly destroyed by a bulldozer [12].
Performance art of the post-war Avant-garde also fea-
tured instrument destruction. Here, no music was played in
the traditional sense, but well-known instruments served a
symbolic role as iconic cultural objects, and violence against
them acted as artistic or political commentary to incite a
strong emotional response. Such performances include Yoko
Ono Piano Drop of Al Hansen and One for Violin Solo
(1962) of Nam June Paik, both performances by Fluxus
artists, and the “Piano Destruction Concerts” of Raphael
Monta˜ nez Ortiz. More recently, Christian Marclay’s video
installation Guitar Drag (2000) explored similar themes [9].
Previous examples of instrument destruction prioritized
the visual and symbolic dimensions of spectacle over pure
sound. While the total eﬀect of instrument destruction can-
not be divorced from its visual and symbolic meaning, some
musicians have experimented with destruction as a vehicle
to explore unusual sounds. Composers Annea Lockwood
and Diego Stocco recorded pieces featuring the sounds of
burning and drowned pianos [8]. Jazz pianist Yosuke Ya-
mashita performed on a burning piano, exploring changes
in sound through his improvisations as the instrument gives
in to ﬂames. These destructive acts can be linked to ex-
tended piano techniques and prepared piano pioneered by
post-war avant-garde composers such as Stockhausen, Cage,
and Cowell, which have been labeled as “mistreatment” by
purists [1].

mashita performing on a burned piano.
Destruction for the sake of music can also be found out-
side of traditional instruments. Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Over-
ture, often performed for the American Independence fes-
tivities features 16 canon ﬁres, for both sound and spectacle.
In the 1940s, musique concr` ete [18] composers also exper-
imented with destruction, such as Concrete PH of Iannis
Xenaxis, which featured sounds from burning charcoal.
Fewer examples of destruction can be found in the world
of electronic musical instruments. Most have been cen-
tered on creating interesting sounds rather than performa-
tive spectacle. Louis and Bebe Barron built overloaded cir-
cuits with parts that exploded to produce the unique sounds
for the ﬁlm Forbidden Planet (1956)[7]. More recently, “cir-
cuit benders” manipulate ready-made electronic devices in
unintended ways to generate interesting eﬀects. However
these performances are not readily perceived as “device mis-
treatment” through the physical gestures of playing [19].
3. DESIGN

struments feeding into a mixer. The instrument

its fate.
Our work explores how the new electronic musical in-
struments could be designed to allow control over both the
spectacle and the sound of their destruction. These “fragile”
instruments each consists of three main parts: a circuit, an
enclosure, and tools for destruction.
Analog electronics lies at the heart of every fragile in-
strument. Each consists of one or more sensors (e.g. pho-
toresistors, piezos, force sensitive resistors), whose output
feeds into one or more analog sound-synthesizing circuits.
The sensors detect the destruction that occurs and modu-
late the output of the synthesized sounds. This circuit is
well-protected by an enclosure and stays intact during de-
struction.
Enclosures are the actual sites of destruction. They are
meant to be destroyed each time and can be made from
low-cost, recyclable, or salvaged materials such as plywood,
plastic, or cardboard. Multiple destructible enclosures can
nest within each other, like Matryoshka dolls, where the
sensors could be distributed among each layer boosting the
overall performance and sound. To better protect the cir-
cuit, the innermost enclosure should be more robust, unlike
the outer ones.
The tools of destruction can also be included in the de-
sign of a fragile instrument. While all fragile instruments
can be destroyed by bare hands, optional tools such as ham-
mers, electric drills, and chainsaws, can add to the spectacle
and soundscape of a performance. Like drum-sticks, guitar
picks, and xylophone mallets for traditional instruments,
these tools enable diﬀerent ways of “playing”.
While a large number of instruments can be created by
mapping some aspect of a performer’s gestures to sounds
on a computer [17], we imposed the design constraint that
our ﬁrst set of instruments remain within the domain of
analog electronics and everyday objects. We imposed this
constraint for the following reasons:
31

“protecting” a cardboard box that encloses a metal-
lic box carrying the fragile board.
• Latency: Purely analog circuits introduce no-noticeable
latency in the translation between sensor signals and
sound
• Expressivity: Analog electronics is known for its
“richness” in synthesized sounds in the world of mod-
ular synthesizers [16]. The direct connection between
sensing and synthesis enables subtle gestures to aﬀect
the resulting sound (e.g. the Theremin)
• Unpredictability: Analog circuits often yield sur-
prising results. Because destruction is chaotic, we
wanted our instruments to sound diﬀerent each time
they are ”played”.
• Aﬀordability: One reason electronic musical instru-
ments are not often destroyed may be due to their high
cost. Fragile Instruments use only commonly found,
inexpensive components that can be easily replaced.
Hence limiting ﬁnancial damages.
• Portability: All fragile Instruments are designed to
be self-contained and “plug-and-play”, requiring no
special wiring. With the addition of wireless micro-
phone transmitters, fragile instruments can be made
untethered, which allows them to be thrown across
the stage or smashed against walls.
4. PROTOTYPES
Numerous fragile instruments can be created based on vari-
ations in circuit design, enclosure materials, and tools used.
We now describe some prototypes that we have explored.
4.1 Circuit
Figure 5: Fragile board that accepts up to 4 diﬀer-
ent input sensors.
Several digital logic gates live at the core of every frag-
ile circuit. We experimented with several variations of the
circuit to yield diﬀerent sounds. The simplest circuit is the
oscillator and it requires only three components: a vari-
able resistor, a capacitor, and an inverting Schmitt trigger
(74HC14). The variable resistor serves as the sensor that
aﬀects the frequency. Any part with variable resistance
could be used, such as a photoresistor, force-sensitive re-
sistor (FSR), ﬂex sensor, or resistive fabric. The frequency
of the oscillation is calculated and approximated using the
formulas below.
f = 1
RCLn(
VT+(Vcc−VT−)
VT−(Vcc−VT+) )
(1)
f = 0.82
RC (2)
In equation 1, R is the resistance of the variable resis-
tor in Ohms and C is the value of the capacitor in Farads.
The natural logarithmic part of the equation calculates the
amount of hysteresis induced by the circuit at a given sup-
ply voltage (VCC) and could be retrieved from the Fairchild
datasheet [4]. The simpliﬁed frequency for our condition is
calculated in equation 2.
For example, a photoresistor of value 100K Ohm, coupled
with a 0.1 uF Capacitor would give a frequency ranging from
80 to 800Hz which is an ideal frequency for audible square
waves. Some of our circuits were powered by 9V batter-
ies and regulated with an LM7805 linear voltage regulator
chip powering the inverters with 5V DC. Other circuits were
powered directly by 3xAAA batteries providing the invert-
ers with 4.5V DC.
Another type of fragile circuit contains oscillators made
by dual-input Schmitt trigger-based NAND gate from the
CMOS 4000 series (CD4093), where the frequency could
also be approximated using the simpliﬁed equation 2. Fre-
quency modulation is achieved by cascading an even num-
ber of dual inputs gated oscillators, which results in more
complex, chaotic behavior that translates to more interest-
ing sounds. Even more variability and unpredictability of
sound can be achieved by introducing feedback between the
gates coupled with tilt-switches or cheap accelerometers.
These oscillators can also be used in conjunction with an
ISD1600B. Allowing the control of the playback speed of
this chip that can record few seconds of audio when cou-
pled with a tiny electret condenser microphone. The sensor
controlling the RC component of equation 1 and 2 shapes
the interaction of any fragile instrument with such a sam-
pler circuit. For example, we can create an instrument that
screams ”ouch!” when it is struck based on how it is struck.
Figure 6: Schematic showing 4 cascading gated os-
cillators used in various fragile instruments inspired
by Nicolas Collins’s Handmade Electronic Music[3]
and Benoˆ ıt Maubrey’s work on the Audio Ballerinas
and Geishas [13].
Our last fragile circuit makes use of the acoustic waves
generated by the force of impact during destruction, which
resonates the inside of the enclosure and vibrates a ceramic
piezo pickup disc. The audio signal recorded by the smash
is then synthesized and sampled back at speeds controlled
by the samplers oscillator. One sound transformation we
explored involves a ring-modulator and a reverb eﬀect.

4.2 Enclosures & Tools
Figure 7: Two fragile instruments: the top one gen-
erates electronic sounds of misery and pain each
time it is hit by the hammer. The bottom is being
destroyed to the point of no return by a drill. More
holes in the box lead to higher frequency changes.
In our prototypes, our circuits have been encased in two
layers of enclosures. The inner layer is a metal box with
small holes that allow some light to aﬀect the photoresis-
tors. The material of the outer enclosure depends on the
nature of the circuit and decides which tools should be used
to perform the destruction ritual. For instance, we used
an acrylic box to enclose our photosensitive instruments to
enable them to be “played” by hand — the shadow cast on
the box aﬀects the sound of the instrument. For cardboard
outer enclosures, a drill would be more convenient and con-
vincing for destruction.
The sensors of a circuit also help determine the material of
the outer enclosure and tools to be used during performance.
FSRs, for example, call for percussive actions, which result
in discrete, rhythmic sounds. Any hammer or blunt object
is perfect for such an interaction, including the performer’s
ﬁst. Circuits involving Piezo pickups are usually made out
of cheap salvaged plywood since they resonate more than
acrylic or plastic boxes.
5. FUTURE WORK
For the instruments explored in this paper, we avoided com-
puter based electronic music. But if we remove that design
constraint, this opens up a variety of computer-based fragile
instruments that could also generate interesting spectacles.
For instance, the sound of the instrument could be digitally
synthesized in low-cost embedded Linux/GNU microcom-
puters such as the Raspberry Pi Zero or the BeagleBone,
as previously explored by the D-Box - an ultra low latency
hackable digital instrument [20]. In real-time the sensor
data could be mapped to diﬀerent sounds or patches.
We would also like to explore the idea of embedding a
fragile instrument inside an actual instrument like the elec-
tric guitar. These fragile Hyperinstrument [11] would am-
plify, distort and sample the sound of the acoustic destruc-
tion of the instrument and perhaps re-synthesize it.
Finally, we would like to explore collective types of in-
strument destruction that involves engaging the audience
in the act. Untethered fragile instruments thrown on stage
into an excited crowd might have the potential of creating
memorable moments between the musicians and their audi-
ence, and perhaps form a type of socially galvanizing group
therapy during diﬃcult times.
6. CONCLUSIONS
We presented the concept of electronic instruments that are
played through the act of destruction. This paper explored
one approach to create such instruments — as reusable ana-
log circuits surrounded by a“sacriﬁcial”shell whose destruc-
tion is detected by sensors to aﬀect the synthesized sounds.
The destruction of our Fragile Instruments delivers an im-
pactful spectacle and striking sounds without the waste of
expensive materials.
