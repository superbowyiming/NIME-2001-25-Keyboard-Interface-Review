ABSTRACT
Deformable interfaces are an emerging area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) 
research that offers nuanced and responsive physical interaction with digital 
technologies. They are well suited to creative and expressive forms of HCI such as 
Digital Musical Interfaces (DMIs). However, research on the design of deformable 
DMIs is limited. This paper explores the role that deformable interfaces might play in 
DMI design. We conducted an online study with 23 DMI designers in which they were 
invited to create non-functional deformable DMIs together. Our results suggest forms 
of gestural input and sound mappings that deformable interfaces intuitively lend 
themselves to for DMI design. From our results, we highlight four styles of DMI that 
deformable interfaces might be most suited to, and suggest the kinds of experience 
that deformable DMIs might be most compelling for musicians and audiences. We 
discuss how DMI designers explore deformable materials and gestures input and the 
role of unexpected affordances in the design process.

Introduction
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research has moved beyond concerns of rigid 
interaction devices to explore deformable materials and interfaces [1][2][3][4]. These 
deformable interfaces offer new opportunities for Digital Musical Interfaces (DMIs) 
design [5][6][7]. For example, an advantage of using deformable interfaces for DMIs is 
that deformable materials have a guiding effect on their use, making them intuitive 
and easy to learn [8][9][10]. However, the nascent nature of deformable DMI design 
practice makes it unclear how DMI designers design with deformable materials and 
how deformable material properties might influence DMI design practice. 
Furthermore, as there is no established design practice for deformable DMIs, it can be 
challenging to design the mappings between gesture input and sound output [6]. In

this paper, we take a step back from deformable DMI implementation to reflect on 
deformable DMI design and ask How might musicians design digital musical 
interfaces with deformable materials? To explore this question, we present a design 
exploration workshop. We let musicians explore the potential of deformable materials 
and deformable input in DMI design and reflect on their design explorations. This 
paper aims to contribute to: 1) A set of potential gesture mappings found in the 
deformable DMI design exploration workshop; 2) A description of the kinds of 
deformable DMI that emerge from the design exploration; 3) Suggestions for the role 
that deformable interfaces might play in DMI design and use.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, deformable interfaces in DMI 
design and HCI are introduced. Then we present our design exploration workshop 
approach and the analysis of workshop outcomes. Finally, we discuss our findings and 
conclude the paper.
Background
Deformable Interfaces in Music
Deformable interfaces use “dynamic changes in a device’s physical shape for input and 
output” and offer new opportunities for HCI research [5][11][12]. Such interfaces offer 
hand-based, body-based, and multidimensional deformable input opportunities [7][13], 
using “dynamic changes in a device’s physical shape for input and output” [11]. 
Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) have been identified as one of the most creative 
and expressive forms of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) [14][15], and DMI 
designers and researchers have explored the use of deformable materials in musical 
instruments and interfaces [1][16][17][18][20][20]. Typically, deformable interfaces for 
music are used to control sound parameters, such as speed, pitch, and note duration 
[5]. For example, NoiseBear allows non-musicians and musicians to easily control 
various sounds by simple squeeze interaction [20]. Similarly, interfaces such as 
Zstretch demonstrate that stretchable controllers could be used to manipulate volume, 
pitch, and speed [17]. This design of mappings between deformable input and sound 
output is becoming a mainstream topic for both DMI designers and researchers [5][6].
As well as experimenting with the design of sound mappings, existing research has 
explored the design of deformable musical interfaces for different music activities. For 
example, Troiano et al. investigate the use of deformable interfaces for performing 
music which highlights the “usefulness of deformable interfaces in the musical

context” [5]. Researchers have also shown that deformable musical interfaces can 
create “playful, visceral, and exploratory music experiences”, which have the potential 
for the public to have an exploratory music experience instead of designing for 
musicians only [1][19][22]. Whilst the research outlined above has explored 
deformable interfaces in mappings design and different musical activities, there is 
little current research on how deformable materials might inspire DMI design itself.
Materiality in Design Research
The form and materiality (i.e. shape, colour, texture) of an interface plays an 
increasingly significant role in HCI research as attention is directed to the aesthetic 
dimension of interaction [22][24]. Form is the “visual, physical, or temporal 
manifestation and/or configuration of a design” [25]. Form and materiality are 
inseparable for an object; therefore researchers consider form from three 
perspectives: material, meaning, and making [25]. Indeed, the materiality of an 
artefact has been identified as a significant part of HCI design in terms of its tactile 
and embodied presence [25][27][28][29].
One approach to investigating materiality is through workshop methods, which have 
had a long and critical role in HCI research, allowing researchers to explore the 
creativity and new ideas of participants [30][31]. For example, Wilde et al. used 
workshops to explore the relations between embodiment, materiality and 
performativity [32], Bjelland and Tangeland used the structured approach to explore 
prototyping haptic user interfaces in the early design stages [33], and Ratto 
reconfigured materials, users, and prototyping as critical making [34]. Andersen 
argues that material experimentation is an “under-described factor” in recent HCI 
research and that material improvisation in their workshop approach could shift 
designers’ attention from design results to the design process and to focus on 
reflections on the material [30].
Exploring Design
One challenge for exploring deformable interface design is that there are currently 
many technical barriers to overcome when implementing deformable interfaces, which 
distract from an open and exploratory design process, such as finding robust sensors 
and materials [18][19][35][20][36]. To be freed from such technical constraints, 
designers need to explore deformable interfaces in open-ended design contexts [37].
Open-ended design thinking can help designers create artefacts without 
implementation constraints and let their imagination run free, offering a novel and rich

creative practice for designers [38][39][40]. Open-ended design approaches have been 
applied in material exploration research and musical instrument design research. For 
example, Lepri and McPherson [40] presented design value discovery through a hands-
on design activity with open-ended design in communities of musical practice. 
Nordmoen et al. [41] explored the craft practice of designers exploring unfamiliar and 
ambiguous sensor material with an open-ended design context. Their exploration 
indicates that the approach of material improvisation in open-ended design contexts 
inspired designers to use craft as a way of thinking through material [30][41][43].
Research Questions
In light of the potential for deformable interfaces in DMI design highlighted above we 
explore the following research questions (RQs) in this paper:
Design Exploration Workshop
We developed an open-ended design thinking workshop building on Andersen’s Magic 
Machine Workshop [30] to explore our research questions. Our workshop focuses 
specifically on how DMI designers think of deformable materials and deformable input 
in musical contexts without technical constraints -- designers were invited to make non-
functional prototypes with deformable inputs. Our motivation for taking this approach 
was to explore subjective design experiences through the process of making and also 
to liberate participants (the DMI designers) from technological concerns and 
limitations and allow them to ask themselves ‘why’ instead of ‘how’ to design DMI with 
deformable inputs [30][40].
The workshop took place in the UK during a period of lockdown in which in-person 
social interaction was heavily restricted, therefore we structured our workshop to take 
place remotely. Participants took part in their own homes and connected using video-
conferencing software. Before the workshop started, participants completed a 
questionnaire about their background and experience in DMI design. Then participants 
signed a consent form and were informed that they could drop out at any time, and 
that the institution's ethics policies were followed. The overall duration of the 
workshop was around 60 minutes.
RQ1: What mappings might DMI designers make between deformable input and 
sound output?  
RQ2: What kinds of DMIs do deformable materials inspire in an open-ended design 
context?
RQ3: What uses of DMIs might be more suited to deformable materials?

Participants
Twenty-three musicians (17 male, 6 female) were recruited by academic mailing lists 
(NIME community: community@nime.org) and social networks. Based on the 
questionnaire results, all participants had experience either in playing an acoustic 
instrument or recording/producing music. Participants’ experience in designing DMI 
ranged from novice designers to experienced designers. 4/23 of the participants did 
not have detailed knowledge or experience of digital instrument design and were 
included in the study for their input regarding gestures and materials related to music 
and musical instruments more broadly. Most of the participants (20/23) had never used 
deformable input in DMI design before. There were eight workshops on Zoom, with an 
average of 3 participants per workshop.
Workshop Design
Following Andersen’s methodology in which workshop materials should remain 
mundane and everyday [30], participants in our workshop were invited to search for 
everyday objects in their homes. Participants were asked to prepare the materials 
before the start of the workshop, and they were informed that the key aim of the 
material searching was to find materials that provide some deformable gestures (i.e. 
stretch, bend, press, twist, and squeeze). These gesture inputs were selected as 
Troiano et al. [5] found them to be the gestures most commonly used by musicians 
with deformable interfaces for performing music. 
The task of searching available materials became the first source of insights about 
participants' assumptions about deformable input, which is different to Andersen's 
approach [30]. In addition, we invited participants to have an open discussion before 
the Prompt activity to discuss their general expectations and ideas on the design 
activity. The six steps of our workshop were:
1. A brief introduction of the aim and procedure was presented. With participants' 
permission, the facilitator started video recording. 
2. Ten minutes of open discussion about participants' understanding of the materials 
they had collected and the design activity.
3. Participants were then provided with Prompt Activities: connect words and drawings 
to deformable input gestures, including bend, press, stretch, twist, and squeeze. 
4. The participants were then asked to use their available materials to build imagined 
instrument(s).

Data Collection and Analysis
The workshop sessions were audio and video recorded and transcribed to facilitate 
thematic analysis. The data analysis included the analysis of design outputs, 
transcriptions of the group discussion, and observations during the study. We followed 
the guidance of thematic analysis [44] and conducted a data-driven approach to 
extract participants' ideas about using deformable input. This process was carried out 
with MAXQDA software.
Findings
In total, 28 prototypes were built - Note that 5 participants built two prototypes and 
some participants only presented a prototype design concept and did not include the 
details such as the mapping design. Table 1 presents examples of prototypes built 
during the workshop with the construction description, the materials and the input 
gestures they used, and the manipulation of the prototypes.
The thematic analysis generated around 90 codes and identified six themes from 
participants' feedback and observation of their design work as described below.

5. Once the group finished building the prototypes, each participant was invited to 
‘play’ their instrument(s) and explain or mock their imagined sound.

For those prototypes designed based on existing instruments (P5, P9, P14), 
participants explained that they wanted to create different interactions for the existing 
instrument when they presented where their ideas came from. P3 described the 
prototype as “a Hand Theremin” , which allows people to control the sound by 
touching and manipulating the material. P3 also mentioned that the idea came the non-
tactile nature of the Theremin, and wanted to design for people who “want to actually 
touch it”. The second type of instruments (P3, P4, P10, P12) are described as designed 
based on the material properties since participants connected the properties of the 
materials to the sound design and interaction method. P3 and P5 described materials 
such as foam and clay that make people subconsciously want to squeeze and press. 
P15 mentioned that material such as paper is reminiscent of a crisp and clear sound as 
the material itself is very light. The third type of instrument was designed for specific 
interaction. One example is a wearable instrument (P3) which shows a way of playing 
with two hands, more like one hand is responsible for chords, and the other hand is 
responsible for melody.
Deformable Input in Musical Context
In selecting the materials, participants revealed glimpses of their initial understanding 
of deformable input i.e. ‘what kind of materials could provide such deformable input’. 
From the results, participants not only used soft materials to achieve deformation, but 
they also used materials such as cardboard to build a physical structure to allow them 
to stretch and bend (one example in Figure 1 (e)).

Tables 2 and 3 present the mappings between deformable input and sound output 
identified in responses to the prompt and design activities. We found that in the 
prompt activity participants focused on the gestures whereas in the design activity 
they also thought about the materials and sound.
In terms of the results of prompt activity (see Table 2), the mapping design is mainly in 
terms of two aspects. Firstly, the imagination of mappings design emerges from 
understanding the gesture inputs—considering the meaning of gesture input in the 
prompt activity inspired participants’ creativity in the design activity. Seven 
participants (P4,  5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 15) reported that thinking about what those gestures

might mean to music inspired them to think about the kind of interfaces they want to 
build and to think about  “what could modify with gesture” (P10). The second aspect of 
inspiration in the mapping design of Prompt Activity is developing ideas from the 
existing musical instruments. Four participants (P3, 5, 7, 8) mentioned that the ideas 
of mappings design came from the gesture input on existing musical instruments they 
had played or known before.

Regarding the results from the design activity (see Table 3), most (59/62) of the 
deformable gesture input (i.e. squeeze, twist, stretch, press, and bend) are designed as 
continuous feature modulation  (e.g. timbre, amplitude or pitch). The changing of 
sound parameters depended on the amount of force exerted by the users (i.e. the 
greater the stretching force, the more significant the change in output). The mappings 
design was suggested to make the musical interaction more “intuitive and 
understandable” (P3).
Sonic Affordances of Deformable Materials
When participants were invited to explain in words or mock the sounds they imagined, 
we found that participants’ imagined sonic outcomes came from both an 
understanding of deformable gestures and also the materials’ affordances. Participants 
mentioned that the texture and haptic feedback of the material gave them ideas about 
the sonic response. P4 described this process as “starting mainly from the physical 
properties of the material”. P21 mentioned that for many instruments, the musician's 
“ability to manipulate the tone is different just because of the physicality of the 
instrument”. The different tactile sensations of the materials allowed DMI designers to 
discover different mapping strategies and sonic responses.
Interaction Styles
We categorised the design prototypes into four types from our analysis of our 
observations and interviews: hand-held instrument, surface-based instrument, 
wearable instrument, and hybrid-mode instrument.

There were 12/28 prototypes identified as hand-held instruments since they were 
played by two-handed input (e.g. Figure 1 (a)(e)). Participants’ descriptions of these 
prototypes referred to traditional acoustic instruments, and some unique modulations 
of deformable input were emphasised. For example, P8 introduced the instrument as 
“holding like an accordion”.
Some mock-ups (4/28) were designed as surface-based (or table-based) instruments 
that allow users to interact by shaping, moving, and manipulating different 
components on it (e.g. Figure 1 (b)(f)). In particular, one type of surface-based 
instrument can be described as material manipulation of sound parameters (see Figure 
1 (b)). One prototype that emerged in our workshop was a “tangible synthesiser 
desk”(P5), which allows users to control the sound parameters by manipulating 
materials instead of pressing buttons or moving sliders.
Some prototypes (3/28) are presented as wearable instruments which provided one-
handed or two-handed input (e.g. Figure 1 (c)(g)). One type of wearable instrument 
that emerged in the workshop is head-mounted (see Figure 1 (c)). Two designers wore 
the prototype as wearing masks and manipulated the prototype with two hands. One 
designer pointed out that singers could play this artefact by manipulating their voices. 
Another type is one which could be worn with one hand/arm and interacted with by the 
movement of the hand/arm with fine control by the other hand (see Figure 1 (g)).
Some prototypes (9/28) were categorised as a hybrid-mode instruments as they were 
presented to be played flexibly (e.g. Figure 1 (d)(h)). Participants also described this 
instrument as “no strict method to play” (P17). These kinds of prototypes were mainly 
designed based on the material itself and so the way of playing them varies with the 
properties of the materials. For example, controlling sound by folding, crumpling, and 
placing paperr (see Figure 1 (d)). Although it was argued that this prototype did not 
include any deformable input, it contributed to a way of thinking that simple materials 
produce complex actions and results.
“It has a memory because once you fold it and you play a bit with it, it will keep 
some scratches on it. So, this could also be something interesting, like an 
instrument with memory.” (P20) (see Figure 1 (d))
Tangible Manipulation of Sound
Designing non-functional prototypes focused DMI designers’ attention on the 
materials, tangible interaction, deformability, and physical expressiveness. Our data 
suggests that interaction with materials can also stimulate designers’ imagination. P7

exemplifies this as “playing with the materials because it is also tactile and gestures, 
that is when you start to imagine possibilities that maybe do not already exist”.
Participants mentioned that direct material manipulation and spatial interaction 
contributed to their designs. Six participants (P4, 7, 9, 12, 22, 23) mentioned that they 
came up with the design ideas when they started to “play” with the materials. Eleven 
participants (P5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 21, 23) considered the interaction and 
input as their first step in designing such interfaces. Five participants (P3, 7, 10, 18, 
21) reported that they designed the sound and the functionality of the interfaces based 
on haptic manipulation. P21 mentioned that “different tactile sensation” offers a 
“different ability to manipulate the tone”, similar to acoustic instruments.
We suggest that there were primarily two aspects of physical expressiveness explored 
in the design workshop from participants’ feedback. The first aspect is the rich 
expressiveness of the material itself, which allows designers to think about using the 
material's affordances and constraints, e.g. building a DMI by “reassemble the 
physical constraints of different ranges” (P20). Another aspect was the variety of 
gestures that could be imagined. Eight participants (P3, 5, 11, 12, 16, 19, 21, 22) 
reported that the objects’ materiality inspired them to explore the relationship 
between different gestures and material properties. For example, “you can squeeze 
and bend the pitch literally by just like moulding in the clay” (P5).
Music Perception
A theme related to how deformable DMIs might be perceived by musicians and 
audiences was identified. Six participants (P3, 11, 19, 20, 22, 23) argued that DMIs 
with deformable input were more suitable for exploratory activities than performing in 
front of the audience. According to P22, sometimes an instrument’s use in 
performance is unnecessary if it is “enjoyable to use” and “as expressive in a particular 
way”. As suggested by P23, one potential challenge of using deformable musical 
interfaces in performance was that it was “extremely difficult to perceive from the 
audience”. Five participants (P3, 15, 20, 22, 23) reported that the experience of 
interacting with deformable interfaces was associated with interacting with the 
material - when the audience cannot touch the interface, they will not be able to 
perceive the interaction. P15 noted that the design challenge of using deformable 
interfaces in DMI might be “how do we make an instrument that is interesting to play 
with and  interesting to listen to”.

It may be that the focus of the workshop led to deformable DMIs which afford an 
exploratory and playful interaction for musicians, or it may be something about the 
properties of deformable interfaces themselves. Three participants  (P20, 22, 23) 
suggested that an “instrument created with no intention of performing to an audience” 
might be one solution, which means “a musical instrument for creating music for the 
musicians” (P22). For performers, “it feels more of a personal experience and less of a 
spectator experience” (P23). This result is similar to findings in current literature 
about the problem of audience understanding and engagement of DMI [45].
Imagined Instruments in Open-ended Design Context
From observations in our study, participants’ design process could be summarised in 
four phases: (i) the conceptual phase (prompt activity), (ii) the experimenting phase 
(design activity), (iii) the implementation phase (design activity), and (iv) the 
performance phase (presentation and demo). The design inspirations emerged in 
different design phases, and some overlapped within the design process. 
Our data indicates that the open-minded design context allows participants to imagine 
the possibility of interactive gestures and materials properties in a musical context. 
This design environment helps designers consider different aspects of materiality 
during the design process. In the ideation phase, understanding material allowed 
participants to evaluate their design requirements and make the design decision with 
the available materials (P2, 3, 6, 13, 16, 21, 22). More than half of the participants 
mentioned that the results had exceeded their expectations; they did not expect they 
could make any design decisions in such a short time with those unfamiliar materials. 
Another aspect is that “without technical constraints”, participants had more freedom 
to think about the gesture input and interaction (P23). P23 viewed design without any 
technical constraints as “a great opportunity because it is imaginary”. This design 
approach was reported to be helpful to get more inspiration with no bound of technical 
limitations. For example, P5 reported that when she designed without thinking of 
implementing the prototype, she found she would more focus on “thinking the design 
of gestures and interaction”. Moreover, design ideas were generated quickly through 
interacting with materials, which surprised many participants (P2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 
15, 16). Five participants (P2, 13, 15, 20, 23) identified themselves as “not a tangible 
guy”, “usually work digitally”, and “do not build much stuff”, but after the hands-on 
activity, they reported “something on my adopt in the future”, and “motivated to maybe 
try to turn this into a real instrument”.

Discussion
Reflecting on our findings, we suggest that participants generated unique design ideas 
from everyday objects in three ways: i) rethinking the materials in a specific context 
(music context); ii) exploring design concepts with concrete objectives (making a non-
functional DMI and demo); and iii) encountering unexpected affordances during design 
exploration. 
From the results, some participants emphasized their reflections on the interfaces’ 
materiality and how the material properties connect to their design concepts. In this 
way, the prompt activity and pre-discussion in this study allowed participants to talk 
about and re-think the meaning of the materials, which led to the prototype’s 
interaction design and physical form becoming clearer. This process is similar to the 
description of material driven design methods in the literature, such as understanding 
the material, creating materials experience vision, manifesting materials experience 
patterns, and designing material concepts [46].
We suggest that the time pressure and the concrete objective for demonstration 
encouraged more focused design output. The limited time forced participants to find 
materials to fit their ideas quickly and to use the most salient properties of the 
materials. As reported above, eight participants reported that the objects' materiality 
inspired them to explore the relationship between different gestures and material 
properties. For example, P22 mentioned that the “imperfect and complex of the 
materials” show the “real richness of expression” - such richness of expression comes 
from the material itself.
The constraints and affordances of materials are a significant guide and influence on 
interactions [47]. In this study, the unexpected affordances of the material provided a 
unique design perspective. For example, P15’s design is a bendable piano made of 
paper. The effect is that the keys are very light as they are made of paper, so people 
can interact with them by blowing air and even “let it go as a sort of instrument played 
by the wind”. We found that the uncovering of unexpected affordances occurred in the 
later stages in the design process - when the initial idea was implemented.
Design Approaches
Reflecting on our results, we identified two main design approaches: i) gesture-guided 
design; and ii) form-driven design. We noted two forms of gesture-guided design 
process: (1) designers re-thinking the meaning of deformable gesture input before the 
hands-on activity, (2) designers focusing on gesture design during the design practice.

For the first case, 10 participants noted that the prompt activity was helpful for them 
to generate ideas of how gesture inputs and sound output could be related. P4 
mentioned that “it is a good starting point to think about what possibilities there could 
be” with those gestures. One example for the second case was P18 who wanted to 
make a guitar-like interface that allows people to pluck strings made from multiple 
materials.
In terms of form-driven design, we noticed that some participants focused on physical 
design or physical qualities during the design process. For example, the hand-held 
instruments and wearable instruments reported in section (see Figure 1). Such a 
design process leads to a more “visual” design result, and it is easy for others to 
understand the designer’s ideas through the appearance. In the presentation after the 
design activity, participants mainly talked about their pieces’ physical shape and how 
the physical design connects to the interaction. For example, P8 noted that “I would 
usually start with the object's physical presence and let that dictate how I would want 
to interact with it, and what gestures I would use”. Alternatively, in P22's design, the 
rich expressiveness of the material itself means that the prototype “ends up with such 
complex shapes”. Such reflection on the form of the design occurred throughout the 
design process. For example, P7, 8, and 15 mentioned that when they interacted with 
their pieces for a while, new ideas emerged about the form design. We suggest that 
this approach is similar to a form-driven design approach widely used in the design 
domain (i.e. fashion design, architecture design, product design, and graphic design) 
[22].
Limitations
There are limitations to our work that might affect the results. One limitation of the 
study design is that participants were not given the same set of materials and tools to 
experiment with. Although instructions on finding suitable materials were introduced 
at the beginning of the study, everyone’s understanding of appropriate materials was 
different. However, as discussed previously, participants’ material selection 
exemplified their initial understanding of what might be deformable input and the 
implicit design question of ‘what kind of materials could provide such deformable 
input’.
The outcomes are based on the analysis of a study with 23 participants who had a 
variety of DMI design experience. A larger number of participants would be needed for 
more substantial results. The study was conducted online, and so the data collection of 
the video recordings was inherently problematic, and there was no opportunity for in-

person discussion and interaction. However, such an approach does allow for including 
participants who might not usually travel to take part in studies in design workshops 
and universities.
Concluding Remarks
This paper presented a study that explored the design of deformable musical 
interfaces through non-functional prototype design practice. Participants generated 
deformable DMI design ideas through rethinking the materials and exploring 
unexpected affordances within a musical design context. We also observed both 
gesture-guided and form-driven approaches to designing deformable DMIs. Future 
research needs to explore how DMI designers might take such design decisions and 
approaches to the implementation phase. For example, exploring how DMI designers 
implement the mapping between deformable input and sound output, examining 
whether design variations depend on the properties of the materials, or even how DMI 
designers would design the materials themselves.
