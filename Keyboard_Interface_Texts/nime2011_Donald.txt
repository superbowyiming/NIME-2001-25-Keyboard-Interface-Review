2. ESTABLISHING SET-UP AND CONTROL
CAPABILITIES
RX zurray Schafer coined the termschizophoniaV meaning
“split sound”V to describe the disconnect between original
acoustic sounds RiXeXV those coupled to their physical proW
duction mechanismsS and their reproduction in other times
or places [[Z]X The instruments of the rP trio possess highly
contrasting sound RreSproduction and manipulation capaW
bilities – they areschizophonic to varying degrees and in
diﬀerent waysX ThusV a challenge facing the group was to
design instrumental setWups that provide the expressive muW
sical control and interaction possibilities necessary to funcW
tion as a cohesive ensembleX
2.1 Individual Instrument Set-ups
ziranda and Wanderley deﬁne a digital musical instrument
RqzvS as having three componentsg a sound source RsynW
thesisSV an interface Rsensor inputSV and a mapping conﬁgW
uration relating these two [c]X The rP trio has carefully
selected and combined newer and established commercially
available equipment to enable diverse and complementary
sound creation and control capabilities for each of the three
performersX vn the cello and percussion setWupsV the group
sought to greatly expand the sonic palettes of acoustic inW
struments while utilizing many aspects of acoustic perforW
mance techniquesX This section outlines the hardware and
software employed by the rP trio and the reasoning behind
these decisionsX
2.1.1 Cello Set-up
The cello setWup is built around a Zeta Strados electric celloV
chosen for its sound qualityX vts active preamp is powered by
a StringPort Polyphonic Stringed vnstrument to USo“ ponW
verter [a] that sends a polyphonic audio signal to a laptopX
The cello is played with a xWoowV a wireless sensorWbow that
measures several bowing parameters and communicates via
oluetooth to the xWnpps software1 [b]X zeasured bowing
parameters areg grip forceV hair tensionV ]q acceleration
and tiltV and length and distance from vR and Rs emittersV
respectivelyV attached under the cello ﬁngerboardX The xW
oow is a gestural controller and becomes a qzv when its
sensor input is mapped to a sound sourceg it may be used to
control processing and playback of live audio andYor samW
ples in xWnppsX The xWoowYxWnpps thereby adds an extra

layer of gestureWsound control capability to the cellist’s perW
formanceX rvery bowing gesture may perform two tasksV
controlling not only sound production on the cello but also
continuous processing parametersX This presents signiﬁcant
mapping and compositional challengesV which are addressed
in ]X“X“ and aX
The limited amplitude range of the electric cello was iniW
tially problematic in the ensembleX n Roland rVWb rxpresW
sion Pedal2 was added as a volume controller to expand dyW
namic range and enable abrupt changesV allowing the cello
to better match the nqSR RiXeXV envelopeS characteristics of
the turntable and VWqrumsX The volume pedal controls the
main output of the xWnpps softwareV attenuating the audio
signal sent from the cello setWup to the mixerX
2.1.2 Percussion Set-up
The percussion setWup is built around a aWpiece Roland VW
qrum kit3 with a TqWf sound module used as a zvqv interW
faceX This VWqrum kit was selected because it is portableV
reliableV and provides tactile feedback similar to acoustic
drumsX Samples are triggered by velocityWsensitive drum
pads and processed by a laptop running –ative vnstruments’
xontakt sampler4X Various qSP parameters are mapped to
the sliders and knobs of a xorg –anoxontrol5X This setWup
allows the percussionist to activate and modify samples in
an intuitive and precise mannerX
VWqrum cymbal pads are replaced with acoustic cymbalsX
This setWup is augmented with smallV resonant acoustic perW
cussion instruments ReXgX bowed crotalesSV ampliﬁed to suit
the performance space and processed by the turntablist
at the mixer Rsee sigure [SX These modiﬁcations provide
acoustic sound options that expand the percussion sound
palette and are often used to enhance blend with the cello
soundsX
2.1.3 Turntable Set-up
The turntable setWup consists of a Pioneer pqwW[ZZZ zx]6
digital turntable and an nllen and ueath Xone f“ mixer7X
The pqwW[ZZZ zx] was selected for its robustnessV portaW
bilityV and wide feature setX vts control features are modW
eled on those of standard vinyl turntablesV including touch
sensitive plattersV master pitchYtempo controls and brakeX
The pqw also has adjustable brake speedsV reverseV and exW
panded pitch range and cue optionsV which enable greater
manipulation of audio materialsX
zanipulating and mixing multiple sound sources in real
time is the core of qw performance practiceX vn the rP trioV
the cello and percussion setWups take the place of additional
turntables that might be routed to the mixer and adjusted
by the turntablistX zusical use of rQV cross fadingV mixing
and eﬀects processingV applied to the ensemble as a wholeV
help to achieve balance and blendV resulting in a cohesive
ensemble soundX

was motivated by the desire for technical autonomy RiXeXV
no need for a sound personSh the trio retains control of onW
stage monitor levelsX qecisions not to use individual mixesV
headphonesV or spatialized monitors were prompted by perW
formers’ wishes to keep physical setWup simple and to hear
the same mix as the audienceV thereby developing control
of their own sounds as part of the ensemble Rmuch like an
acoustic chamber groupSX These choices present major imW
plications for the design of individual instrument soundsV

3. CREATING INSTRUMENT AND ENSEM-
BLE IDENTITIES
vndividual instrument identitiesV and roles within the rP
trioV are dependent on decisions relating to all three compoW
nents of qzvs described by ziranda and WanderleyX These
areg the physical interfaces and control capabilities they afW
fordh the sounds producedV whether inherent RacousticS or
assigned RsampledV synthesized or processedSh and the mapW
pings between the twoX The ﬁxed setWup of the rP trio was
described in the previous sectionX vn the present sectionV the
contributions of sounds and mappings to the development
of instrument identities and rolesV and ﬁnally the emergence
of an ensemble performance practiceV will be consideredX
3.1 Instrument Identities and Mappings
vn a context where each of the instruments can sound like
RalmostS anythingV they begin to be deﬁned by their control
capabilities and limitationsX vndividual instrument identiW
ties will become more deﬁned as a larger body of repertoire
for the rP trio is createdV revealing which sound and mapW
ping elements are particular to speciﬁc compositions and
which are consistently retained by each instrumentX
The decision to hear only one mix from shared monitors
results in additional challenges Rdescribed in “X“X[SX When
instrument sounds are similar and their source sharedV perW
formers have diﬃculty distinguishing their own soundsV reW
sulting in diminished control [f]X vt is preferable that each
instrument’s sounds be distinctV howeverV the ability to blend

may be essential to some compositionsX vn these instancesV
controlYperformance gestures must be very clearX ThereW
foreV the rP trio is developing a core of gestureWprocessing
mappings that remain quite consistentV despite changing
sonic materials Rsee sigure “SX These include gestures to
control volumeV envelope shape and aspects of timbre for
each instrumentV with particular attention to ﬁlteringV amW
plitude controlV velocity scaling and gain stagingX This proW
vides a means for performers to play expressively and “toW
gether” as an ensemble – dynamic and timbral ranges are
controllable and compatibleX n stable set of mappings also
establishes mutual understanding of the control resulting
from performance gesturesV providing some degree of multiW
modal congruence between gesture and soundX ndditional

3.1.1 Cello Identity
The electric cello is the leastschizophonic in the ensemble –
its sonic identity is largely tied to its acoustically generated
soundX yike the electric guitarV it produces an ampliﬁed auW
dio signal that may be modiﬁed by applying various digital
signal processing RqSPS eﬀectsX vn the rP trioV the cello
is the only instrument able to accurately perform pitched
materialV suggesting a role as a melodic instrumentX The xW
oowYxWnpps enables playback of samplesV and continuous
control of sound processing by bowing gesturesV potentially
allowing the cello to assume other rolesX
3.1.2 Cello Mapping
The xWoowYxWnpps adds a dual layer of gestureWsound conW
trol capability to the cellist’s performanceg bowing gestures
may determine both sound production on the cello and conW
tinuous processing parametersX nchieving compatibility beW
tween the two presents signiﬁcant mapping and composiW
tional challengesX The cellist andYor composer specify the
types of qSP and their control Rand scalingS by assigning
sensed bowing parameters to eﬀects ReXgX bow length to
delayh distance from ﬁngerboard to ﬁlter frequencyXS in
xWnppsX Sound production and control gestures must be
congruousV highly repeatableV reasonably intuitiveV and erW
gonomic to the cellistX This necessitates close collaboraW
tion between cellist and composer and careful compositional
planningX vnﬁnite mappings are possibleV but most successW
ful combinations draw on established cello techniquesX
3.1.3 Percussion Identity
The identities and roles of the percussion setWup in the rP
trio are deﬁned by the sample libraries controlled and the
limitations imposed by triggerWbased performanceX qespite
these constraintsV it can produce both eventWbased and texW
tural sonic materialsV using sample manipulation paramW
eters and acoustic percussionX To fulﬁll these rolesV apW
propriate sample library construction is criticalX zuch of
the percussion’s sonic identity is reWcreated with each pieceX
3.1.4 Percussion Mapping
yogical sample to drum pad assignment is paramount for
the VWqrumsX The standard drum kit organizes drum locaW
tion based on pitch rangeg lower sounds are located at the
player’s right Rﬂoor tomsS and feet Rkick drumS8X ns the kick
drum is typically the lowest pitched instrumentV the kick
drum pad is reserved for lowerWpitched or loopWbased samW
plesV utilizing that drum’s association with keeping steady
timeX PitchV envelopeV and ﬁlters are modiﬁed in real time
via –anoxontrolV mapped according qSP requiredX
3.1.5 Turntable Identity and Mapping
The limitations and idiosyncrasies of the turntable deﬁne
its identity within the rP trioX vt has ﬁxed mappings of
performer gesture to controlYmanipulation parameter but
the sound materials available may change from moment
to moment and piece to pieceX The sounds the turntable
RreSproduces are samples created by the composer or seW
lected by the performerX Textural dronesV rhythmic maW
terialsV eventsV transitionsV scratch solos and preWrecorded
tape passages are musicalYstructural roles the turntable can
readily performX
3.2 Flexibility of Sounds and Mappings
qespite arriving at a ﬁxed setWupV the wealth of sound and
mapping possibilities for each instrument is only partially
constrainedX Some sounds are inherent to an instrument
RiXeX acoustic percussionV electric celloS but may be modiW
ﬁed through digital processingX Other sonic materials are
entirely at the discretion of the performers andYor comW
posers RiXeX those reproduced by sampleWbased instrumentsg
turntablesV VWqrumsV and potentially xWoowSX The instruW
ments of the rP trio also diﬀer greatly in their capacity to
alter mappingsV thus ranging from minimal to total ﬂexiW
bility in both their sonic and mapping possibilitiesX rach
instrument’s sounds and the performance gesturesYplaying
techniques enabled by its mappingRsS contribute to its indiW
vidual identity and roleRsS within the ensembleX
3.2.1 Two Dimensions of Flexibility
ns represented in ﬁgure ]V the cello setWup has the least ﬂexW
ibility in its sonic identity Rwhen not using the xWoow as
a sample playback controllerS while the percussion has the
mostV as it can readily trigger more simultaneous samples
than the turntableX uoweverV the cello setWup aﬀords highly
ﬂexible gestureWprocessing mapping strategies because a mulW
titude of qSP parameters can be mapped to a number of
continuous sensor input streams from the xWoow Rand comW
bined with live creation of audio materialSX vn contrastV the
mapping of turntable control gestures to sound processing
is essentially preWestablished and ﬁxedX The rP trio perW
cussion setWup falls somewhere in the middle in its mapping
ﬂexibility – though its samples must always be triggered by
a striking gestureV both samples and processing eﬀects are
ﬂexibly assigned to the drum pads and the –anoxontrol’s
knobs and slidersV respectivelyX oecause of its high ﬂexiW
bility in terms of both sonic identities and mappingsV the
percussion setWup often serves as the “glue”V or mediatorV
between the cello and turntable setWupsV providing a middle
ground between the twoX
4. REHEARSAL AND CREATIVE ISSUES

creation and rehearsal of new works continue to inﬂuence

4.1 Latency
With practiceV all performers can learn to adjust for a cerW
tain amount of latencyV but too much or variableYrandom
latency can destroy performer and audience perception of
sounds resulting from performance gestures RiXeX multisenW
sory congruenceSX The VWqrums and turntable have imperW
ceptible to minimal latencyX uoweverV the cello is aﬀected
by variable latency depending on the qSP appliedX To reW
duce the negative eﬀects of this issue [d]V cello parts with
demanding processing are composed primarily of sustained
sounds and textural eﬀects that do not require rhythmic
precisionX yatency challenges are resolved through collaboW
ration between composer and performers on successful musiW
cal materials and careful adjustment of qSP and mappingsV
and by individual practiceX
4.2 Ensemble Performance and Expressivity
Successful negotiation of latency issues allows the rP trio
to overcome synchronization diﬃcultiesX Oore advocates
technical mastery on new instruments [e] – this is of utW
most importance in an ensemble settingX –ot only must
performers be highly proﬁcient and consistent on their own
instrumentV they must be ﬂexible enough to adapt in real
time to nuances in colleagues’ performanceX vt has been exW
tremely helpful for members of the rP trio to understand
the limitations and capabilities of each other’s setWup so they
may anticipate and react to best eﬀectV resulting in “tight”
ensemble performance and enhanced musical expressivityX
4.3 Making Changes in Rehearsal
Working with qzvs in an ensemble context presents a speW
cial rehearsal challengeg namelyV that sampleWbased materiW
alsV qSP eﬀects and mappings cannot be instantly modiﬁedX
This limitation inﬂuences the sonic materialsV compositional
structures and mapping strategies used by composers and
performersX ouilding ﬂexibility into patchesV sampled maW
terials and compositions can allow for some onWtheWspot
tweakingX zinor adjustments become an important part of
the rehearsal processV however major changes require work
outside of ensemble rehearsalX sor each performerV a thorW
ough knowledge of the sound creation and mapping proW
cesses behind their instrument is invaluable as it allows for
rapid troubleshooting and clear communication with comW
posers and colleaguesX
4.4 Composition Process
pomposers writing for the rP trio must either accept preW
viously established sound palettes and gestureWprocessing
mappings and rework these into a new composition Ras they
would in writing for acoustic instrumentsSV or create new
sonic materials and mappingsX vn the latter caseV it is preferW
able that composers work closely with ensemble members
to develop comfortable and eﬀective means of controlling
soundsX uoweverV despite collaborationV developing and
learning to perform with new mappings require time and
practice and will invariably increase the scope and duration
of a compositional projectX
5. CONCLUSIONS
The rP trio has achieved its goal of establishing a robust
and musically expressive ensembleX Through various apW
proaches to developing instrument identitiesV mappingsV and
performance practiceV the group has integrated three conW
trasting instrumental setWupsX pareful attention to musical
identities and limitations has laid the foundation for a viable
and musically satisfying electronic chamber music ensemble
5.1 Future Directions
The rP trio will expand its repertoire and commission outW
side composersX This collaborative process will provide new
perspectives though the practical and artistic challenges enW
countered in each projectX quring creationV rehearsalV and
performance phasesV the ensemble’s “performance practice”
will continue to evolveX The trio plans to assemble the ﬁndW
ings of these processes into a detailed set of compositional
and procedural instructions that may prove useful to others
working with live electronics in chamber ensemble settingsX
