ABSTRACT
Ghost Play is a violin-playing robot that aims to realize bowing and fingering similar to 
human players. Existing violin-playing machines have faced various problems 
concerning performance techniques owing to constraints imposed by their design. 
Bowing and fingering that require accurate and high-acceleration movement (e.g., a 
spiccato, tremolo, and glissando) are essential but challenging. To overcome this 
problem, Ghost Play is equipped with seven electromagnetic linear actuators, three for 
controlling the bow (i.e., the right hand), and the other four for controlling the pitch on 
each string (i.e., the left hand). The violin-playing robot is mounted with an unmodified 
violin bow. A sensor is attached to the bow to measure bow pressure. The control 
software receives a time series of performance data and manipulates the actuators 
accordingly. The performance data consists of the bow direction, bow speed, bow 
pressure, pitch, vibrato interval, vibrato width, and string to be drawn. We also 
developed an authoring tool for the performance data using a graphic user interface. 
Finally, we demonstrated Ghost Play performing bowing and fingering techniques such 
as a spiccato, tremolo, and glissando, as well as a piece of classical music.

Introduction
Various machines that play musical instruments have been developed. One of the 
underlying motivations for developing instrument-playing robots that can play an 
unmodified instrument in a similar way to human players is to deepen our 
understanding of the mechanism of the instrument and the act of playing it. The 
knowledge obtained from such research would be valuable for instrument makers and 
players. Furthermore, the development of instrument-playing robots is relevant to the 
computational exploration of music because it expands the boundaries of music to be 
explored.

Violin is a challenging instrument that has been subjected to automatic playing by 
machines [1]. Bowing and fingering (i.e., the use of the right and left hands) are the 
two essential elements of playing the violin.
With regard to the bowing mechanism, rotating wheels were often used in existing 
machines, from Violano Virtuoso in the early twentieth century [2] to recently 
developed Hathaani [3]. In violin MUBOT [4], the bow was reciprocated linearly by an 
arm consisting of a pantograph mechanism, while the violin was rotated around its 
long axis. In Ro-Bow [5], the bow movement was limited to only a linear back-and-forth 
motion. With these mechanisms, bowing techniques that required high-acceleration 
movement or vertical control of the bow, such as a spiccato and tremolo, were difficult 
to perform. Multi-articulated arms for the bowing mechanism have been developed [6] 
[7]. Theoretically, such a mechanism has sufficient degrees of freedom to imitate 
various bowing techniques. However, it is challenging to control the bow using multi-
articulated arms. In addition, the equipment tends to generate loud noises, which may 
interfere with the performance.
With regard to the fingering mechanism, most previous violin-playing machines 
focused on discrete pitch control, although some were able to play vibrato. In other 
words, continuous pitch changes, which are indispensable for playing glissando and 
portamento, have not been addressed. Playing these techniques requires rapid 
movement of the left-hand element. An exception to this is Hathaani [3], which was 
designed to play a gamaka (i.e., a pitch-based embellishment used in Carnatic music) 
on the D string. We also note that some robotic guitar-like instruments, such as 
GuitarBot [8] and MechBass [9], used linear motion systems to move the fretting units 
along the strings.
As described above, some essential techniques, such as a spiccato, tremolo, and 
glissando, have received little attention owing to the constraints imposed by the 
machine design. In this study, we developed a novel violin-playing robot named Ghost 
Play1. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show an overall and close-up view of the proposed robot. 
The robot is equipped with seven linear electromagnetic actuators. Four actuators are 
used for fingering (i.e., to imitate the left hand), while the other three are used for 
bowing (i.e., to imitate the right hand). The electromagnetic linear actuators that we 
used can provide high thrust despite their quietness. This mechanical structure 
enables accurate and high-acceleration movements. As a result, Ghost Play can 
perform bow movement and pitch control similar to human players from a mechanical 
viewpoint. Another feature of our robot is that it can use a standard violin and bow

without modification, except that a sensor for measuring the bow pressure is attached 
to the bow, and a pickup microphone is attached to the violin.

Our robot can continuously control the bow speed, bow pressure, and pitch. The bow 
movement is not limited to the horizontal but can also be vertical to the fingerboard. In 
other words, Ghost Play can control the bow off the string while playing, in addition to 
backward and forward linear motions. This bowing mechanism enables the robot to 
play a spiccato. The bow-bridge distance is fixed mechanically in the current hardware 
design. Although the bow tilt can be changed mechanically, the current control 
software keeps it constant. Hence, two of the three essential bowing parameters [10] 
[11] can be controlled by our robot. With regard to fingering, Ghost Play can control 
the pitch continuously, even while keeping the string pressed down. This fingering 
mechanism enables the robot to play glissando and portamento. It is also possible to 
have the robot play a piece in just intonation or using microtones, although we did not 
perform in this work.
Ghost Play plays the violin following a given performance instruction. More precisely, 
the control software written in Max and JavaScript receives a time series of 
performance data, makes a motion plan, and manipulates the actuators accordingly.

The basic performance data consists of the bow direction, bow speed, bow pressure, 
pitch, and strings to be drawn. We can add a vibrato interval and width to the 
performance data.
The main achievements of this work are as follows:
Terminology
Before describing our robot, we will introduce some terminology regarding the violin 
and bow used in this study (see Figure 3). The direction of the bow relative to the 
violin can be represented by three angles: inclination, skewness, and tilt [12]. The 
point at which the bow hair and string come in contact is called a contact point. The 
bow-bridge distance is the distance between the contact point and the bridge. The bow 
speed, or the bow velocity, is the speed at which the bow moves back and forth to draw 
the string. The force/pressure with which the bow presses the string at the contact 
point is called the bow force/pressure. The frog is the bottom part of the bow that 
encloses the mechanism responsible for tightening and holding the bow hair. The tip is 
the top end of the bow. A normalized bow position  is defined as the distance between 
the contact point and frog normalized by the length of the bow hair , as shown in 
Figure 4. The domain of  is .

electromagnetic linear actuators, aiming to perform bowing and fingering as done by 
human players.

according to a given time series of the performance data.

Hardware
In this section, we describe the hardware of Ghost Play. As shown in Figure 1 and 
Figure 2, the violin installed on a white box is surrounded by electromagnetic linear 
actuators that play the role of human hands. One can observe the robot playing the 
violin and bow without any obstructions. A sensor is attached to the bow to measure 
the bow pressure, and a pickup microphone for calibration and monitoring is attached

to the violin. No other modifications were made to the instrument. The box contains an 
amplifier, motion controller cards for the actuators, a microcontroller for the bow 
pressure sensor (Arduino), a microcontroller for the string pressing unit (AVR 
ATmega8), and a computing machine (Windows PC). Figure 5 illustrates the hardware 
architecture. Each individual component is explained in the next section.
Linear Actuator
Ghost Play is equipped with seven electromagnetic linear actuators: three are used for 
bowing and the other four are used for finger traversal on each string. Figure 6 shows 
a back view of Ghost Play. We used a linear shaft drive SHM-165 manufactured by Miki 
Pulley Co. Ltd. as the actuators. It is a cylindrical linear motor system in which a coil 
wound around the shaft with permanent magnets converts the electromagnetic force 
into thrust. This model has a 16 mm diameter shaft with a maximum thrust of 117 N 
and a maximum speed of 4,000 mm/s. We used two motion controller cards, PPCI7443, 
manufactured by Nippon Pulse Motor, to control the actuators. A single motion 
controller is connected to a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus and can 
control four linear actuators.

Bowing Unit
The bowing control unit consists of three electromagnetic linear actuators. We refer to 
each actuator as BowBaseLeft, BowBaseRight, and BowArm. Figure 7 illustrates the 
connections between the three actuators. The bow is held by BowArm in a cantilever 
configuration. The BowArm is connected on top of the BowBaseLeft and BowBaseRight 
via a rotary and linear bearing. This structure enabled the robot to perform the 
following:
Although we developed the hardware to tilt the bow, we did not implement the 
software to change it during the performance. In this study, the bow tilt was controlled 
to be a constant. Moreover, the robot can play multiple stops from a mechanical 
viewpoint. However, this technique was not used in this study.
One limitation of the current structure is that the bow-bridge distance cannot be 
changed during the performance. According to previous studies, the essential bowing 
parameters are the bow speed, bow pressure, and bow-bridge distance [10] [11].

Bow Pressure Sensor
A bow pressure sensor was implemented, as proposed in a previous study [13]. This 
sensor consists of a metal strip with two strain gauges glued on both sides. The metal 
strip is in contact with the bow hair through a cylindrical piece of wood and bends in 
response to the bow deflection. We can estimate the bow pressure from the bow 
position and the bending of the metal strip after a calibration procedure. The 
implemented bow pressure sensor is attached to the bow frog without modifying the 
bow, as shown in Figure 8. A microcontroller (Arduino) receives signals from the 
sensor. A photocoupler electrically isolates the power supply to the actuators and one 
of the sensors to avoid disturbance of the sensor measurements by electrical noise 
from the actuator.

Fingering Unit
One electromagnetic linear actuator is used for finger traversal on each string, as 
shown in Figure 6. Hence, four actuators are used for fingering.
Figure 9 shows the string-pressing units for each string. One string pressing unit is 
mounted on each linear actuator and moves along the string using the actuator. The 
finger press unit consists of a solenoid, springs, wires, and bearings. The part that 
touched the string, referred to as a finger, is covered with vinyl and polyurethane 
tubing to enable smooth position changes while keeping the string pressed down. The 
solenoid moves the finger in contact with and away from the string, controlled by an 
electrical circuit consisting of a microcontroller (AVR ATmega8) and metal-oxide-
semiconductor-field-effect transistors (MOSFETs).
All pairs of the linear actuator and string pressing unit can operate independently 
without interfering with each other almost everywhere. One exception is when two 
pairs are positioned very close to the nut on two adjacent strings. The string pressing 
unit should be reduced in size to resolve this limitation.

Software
We developed the control software mainly in Max. JavaScript was used for motion 
planning and visualization, and MaxCpp2 was used to communicate with the motion 
controller cards. Figure 10 shows the Max patch (i.e., program in Max) of the main 
controller. The control software working is explained as follows.
First, the control software receives a time series of performance data at intervals of 10 
ms. The basic performance data at each time consists of the following data:
The vibrato interval and width can be added. An example of the performance data is 
presented in the Appendix. The control software then creates a motion plan. Note that 
we can manipulate the actuators by sending a time series of positions where the 
moving parts should be located at each instant. Figure 11 shows the Max patch of 
actuator control. Finally, the motion plan is sent to the controller cards to manipulate 
the actuators. In addition, the string pressing instruction is sent to the microcontroller 
(AVR ATmega8) to control the solenoids.

It can be noted that the time interval of 10 ms is based on the proposed design but not 
the limitation imposed by the actuator or the motion controller card. Even though this 
interval is seemingly sufficient, it is possible to further reduce the interval.

Calibration
Calibration must be performed before playing to identify the position of each string, 
measure the relationship between the bow position and bow pressure, and confirm the 
correspondence of the position of the finger (i.e., the string-pressing unit) and pitch. 
The bow pressure sensor also requires calibration. These are affected by various 
factors, such as the shape and setup of the violin and bow, the type of the strings and 
bow hairs, the way the violin and bow are mounted, and the humidity. Hence, 
calibration is required every time any relevant condition changes to maintain accurate 
control. We used a bow pressure sensor and pickup microphone during the calibration 
process.
First, we conducted the calibration procedure of the bow pressure sensor according to 
[13]. This enabled us to estimate the pressure at the contact point from the measured 
value.
Next, the robot identified the bow location and the direction in which it touched the 
strings. When the bow pressure exceeded a certain threshold, we determined that the 
bow hair was in contact with the string. Which string is being played can be 
determined based on the fundamental frequency (F0) of the sound recorded by the 
pickup microphone. In this study, we used fzero~ [14], a Max object for F0 estimation. 
The range of the inclination angle at which the bow touched two adjacent strings was 
manually identified. Note that double stop was not implemented in this study, although 
it could be. From this observation, we determined the condition of the bow inclination 
at which the bow touched each string. Figure 12 shows the correspondence between 
the bow inclination and the string touched by the bow at that angle.
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Ghost Play - A Violin-Playing Robot using Electromagnetic Linear Actuators
15
Moreover, the robot measured the relationship between the bow position and bow 
pressure. Explicitly what is to be measured in the calibration process is the bow 
pressure at the selected bow positions and displacements. The bow pressure was 
measured using the sensor described above. We will describe how to estimate the bow 
displacement at a given bow pressure and bow position later in this paper.
Finally, the robot checked the mapping of the finger position to the pitch. We measured 
the F0 of the sound recorded by the pickup microphone while changing the position of 
the string-pressing unit. Using the results from this process, we can determine the 
finger positions to be used in the performance.
Motion Planning
The data that should be sent to the motion controller cards to manipulate the actuators 
is a time series of positions at an interval of 10 ms where the moving parts should be 
located. Below, we will explain how to calculate the desired position of the moving 
parts of the actuators at each time instant from the given performance data.

Fingering
Because the mapping of the pitch to the finger position is obtained during the 
calibration process, it is a straightforward process to determine the position of the 
moving part of the actuator for fingering that corresponds to a given pitch.
Bowing
The configuration of the moving parts of the actuators for bowing can be calculated 
geometrically from the location and direction of the bow. This means that we need to 
calculate the location and direction of the bow at each instant from the given 
performance data. Specifically, we need to determine the bow inclination, normalized 
bow position, and vertical displacement of the bow from the string.
First, using the mapping of the string to be drawn to the bow inclination obtained 
during the calibration process, we determined the desired bow inclination from the 
given performance data. We note that a range of the bow inclination corresponds to 
each string. Thus, we chose the center value during a single note and smoothly 
interpolated the bow inclination at the time of string-crossing.
Then, we determined the bow position at each time instant by accumulating a series of 
bow speeds, starting from the initial bow position. Here, we refer to the location of the 
contact point (i.e., the point where the string and bow hair contact) in the direction of 
the bow as the bow position.
Finally, given the calculated bow inclination and position, we determined the vertical 
displacement of the bow from the string. When no string is drawn, we need not pay 
attention to this quantity. Thus, we focus on the displacement of the bow pressed into 
the string, which is explained in the next section.
Bow Displacement
We need to determine the desired displacement of the bow perpendicular to the bow 
hair denoted by  when the following two quantities are given:
Note that  was introduced in Terminology. Here, we set the origin of the bow 
displacement such that  when the bow hair and string are in contact without 
exerting any force on each other. For this purpose, we can use the observed values of 
 at selected values of  and  using the bow pressure sensor. Therefore, we can infer

the relationship between these quantities using the observed data. Then, it becomes 
possible to estimate the bow displacement  that is necessary to apply the force  at 
the normalized bow position .
The displacement is caused by two factors: the deflection of the bow hair  and that of 
the string  (see Figure 13): 
According to [13],   can be written as
where  and  denotes the tension and length of the bow hair, respectively.

where  denotes the transverse stiffness of the string.   is an index that 
represents the string that is drawn. Note that stiffness is intrinsic to each string. 
Therefore, we obtain the following relationship.
Using the non-linear least squares fitting, we can infer the unknown parameters, 
namely ,  and  from the observed data. Figure 14 shows the observation results 
and the inferred approximation surface. Because all unknown parameters have been 
inferred, we can determine the bow displacement  that is necessary to apply the force 
 at the normalized bow position .
Authoring Tool
As manual preparation of performance data for every 10 ms intervals is a time-
consuming task, we developed a simple authoring tool with a GUI using TouchOSC3.

In this application, a user can edit a time series of the performance data during a 
single note. A user gives the duration, string to be drawn (i.e., G, D, A, or E), pitch, 
bow direction (i.e., up- or down-bow), and vibrato speed. In addition, the user can 
provide a value for the bow speed, bow pressure, and vibrato depth at any three or 
more different times. Then, the application generates time series of these quantities at 
intervals of 10 ms during the note using cubic spline interpolation. The user can 
concatenate adjacent notes created in this manner. The user can also insert a rest 
instead of a note. We note that the pitch should be constant during a single note in the 
current application. When the user wants to vary the pitch during a "note", it is 
possible to edit the data manually using other tools afterward. Moreover, it is the 
user's responsibility to maintain consistency at the boundaries of adjacent notes in the 
current implementation.
Another function of the application is to let the robot play a created passage. One 
notable use of this application is that a user can easily check the quality of a short 
passage by hearing the performance. This is helpful because the quality of a given 
curve of the bow speed, bow pressure, and vibrato depth is difficult to evaluate without 
hearing. It is practically difficult to create performance data for a long piece of music 
using only this application. However, a user can use the notes created using the 
application as building blocks to author performance data on a long musical piece 
using other tools.

Moreover, Ghost Play can play musical pieces by combining various performance

défunte (Pavane for a Dead Princess) by Maurice Ravel [15], accompanied by digital 
piano. Here, we implemented a program in Max (i.e., Max patch) that synchronizes 
violin performance with MIDI signals from the digital piano.

Future Work
Owing to constraints imposed by the hardware design, the robot cannot change the 
bow-bridge distance during a performance. According to previous studies [10] [11], the 
bow speed, bow pressure, and bow-bridge distance are essential bowing parameters 
that affect the tone. Extending the hardware to control the bow-bridge distance is a 
future task to improve the sound quality. Moreover, because the current robot is 
equipped with only one string-pressing unit for each string, it is difficult to play 
techniques such as trills, artificial harmonics, and a pizzicato. The fingering unit needs 
to be enhanced to enable the robot to perform these techniques.
Some performance techniques remain unimplemented, although it was possible from a 
mechanical viewpoint. For example, we did not generate performance data for multiple 
stops, natural harmonics, or a one-bow staccato. In addition, string-crossing was not 
necessarily smooth; hence, it had to be improved, both for slurred one and one with 
separate bows. Moreover, we used only the equal temperament, while it was a possible 
extension to use only an intonation. Furthermore, we did not explicitly consider the 
bounce of the bow in this study. Some advanced bowing techniques, such as ricochet 
and sautillé, may require explicitly considering bow bouncing.

Real-time feedback of sensor signals and recorded sounds to attain performance 
control is a promising challenge. The bow pressure sensor and pickup microphone 
were used for calibration and monitoring in this study. The data obtained from these 
are invaluable for improving the sound quality and for consistently performing difficult 
techniques.
Another significant challenge is obtaining high-quality data. As we can see in Video 4, 
the performance of our robot was not technically skilled and lacked musicality. The 
essential difficulty lies in the generation of the performance data. Hand-crafted 
performance data tends to be of low quality. One way to solve this problem is to 
develop algorithms to generate performance data. To evaluate a given algorithm, a 
method to quantitatively evaluate the sound quality and skill of the performance 
technique is needed, which is another challenging task. Another way is to learn from 
human violinists. First, we need to observe various parameters, such as bow 
movement, bow pressure, and fingering, while violinists play, which is not a trivial task 
[16][17]. Fingering may be automatically transcribed from recordings [18]. Then, the 
performance data for the robot is extracted from the observed data, where we may 
need to adapt the observed data to the robot. Considering the individual differences of 
each instrument, a more detailed calibration may be needed to apply the performance 
data obtained in this way. Once a large amount of quality data is collected, developing 
a machine learning model using these data is also promising.
Conclusions
We developed a new violin-playing robot named Ghost Play that aims to perform 
bowing and fingering as done by human players. For this purpose, we equipped the 
robot with electromagnetic linear actuators: three for bow movement and four for 
finger traversal. The strings were pressed using solenoids. An unmodified violin and 
bow were mounted on Ghost Play. A pickup microphone and bow pressure sensor were 
attached to the violin and bow, respectively. Ghost Play can control the bow speed, bow 
pressure, and pitch, while the bow-bridge distance is fixed. The control software 
written in Max receives a time series of performance data, including the bow speed, 
bow pressure, and pitch. We can add a vibrato interval and a vibrato width. The control 
software create a motion plan from the performance data and manipulate the 
actuators and solenoids accordingly. We also developed an authoring tool for 
performance data with a GUI using TouchOSC. It can generate a time series of the bow 
speed, bow pressure, and pitch at intervals of 10 ms using spline interpolation from a 
few data points given by a user. Finally, we demonstrated Ghost Play playing several

music.

Data Structure of Performance Data
The data format of the performance data used in this study is JSON. It can be divided 
into bowing and fingering data.
The following is an example of bowing data.
{ 
    "duration": 2.5, 
    "bowDirection": "up", 
    "bowSpeed": [ 
        37.078651785850525 
        ... 
    ], 
    "bowPressure": [ 
        27.808988094329834 
        ... 
    ], 
    "initialBowPosition": 323.25, 
    "bowInclination": [ 
        12.469518184661865, 
        ... 
    ] 
}
The following is an example of fingering data.
{ 
    "string": "A", 
    "pitch": 79,   // MIDI note 
    "vibratoDepth": [ 
        0,

], 
    "vibratoSpeed": 74, 
}, 
"solenoid": {    
    "G": 0, 
    "D": 0, 
    "A": 1, 
    "E": 0 
}
Here, we can provide a time series of the pitch (in Hz) with an interval of 10 ms 
instead of using a MIDI note. This enables the robot to play glissando and microtones.

1.  An early prototype of Ghost Play was demonstrated by one of the authors (M.F.) 
as part of a talk at TEDxSeeds 2011. The essential extensions have been made since 
that time: 1. The prototype used electromagnetic linear actuators only for bowing, 
while the current robot uses them both for bowing and fingering; 2. The bow 
pressure sensor present in the current robot was not used in the prototype. In other 
words, the bow pressure was not controlled in the prototype; 3. We redesigned and 
rewrote the control software in Max and JavaScript from scratch. ↩
