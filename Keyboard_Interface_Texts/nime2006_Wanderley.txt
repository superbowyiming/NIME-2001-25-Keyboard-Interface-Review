ABSTRACT
This paper describes an online Wiki, a collaborative Web
site designed to allow users to edit and add content. It
was created at the Input Devices and Music Interaction
Laboratory with the aim of promoting and supporting the
construction of new musical interfaces. Although many
individual universities and research centres oﬀer sources
of relevant information online, this project allows for easy
sharing and dissemination of information across institu-
tional and international boundaries. In this paper, the in-
ternal framework and categorization scheme for the Wiki
is proﬁled, and each section is introduced. The beneﬁts of
joining this eﬀort are clearly demonstrated, and the pos-
sible future directions of the project are detailed.

1. INTRODUCTION
A Wiki, a term derived from the Hawaiian for “quick”,
is a Web site conﬁgured to collect and distribute free infor-
mation, by allowing site viewers to edit its content [18]. It
is made up of two systems working together—at e m p l a t e
layer which converts a simple markup language written
by users to HTML documents, and a version control log
that records the time and page on which each individual
edit occurs. These two parallel subsystems facilitate non-
destructive editing and help safeguard against vandalism
[10]. By its nature, a Wiki makes possible many-to-many
communication amongst contributers and users [4].
There are several Wiki software engines available, both
proprietary and open source [13] [9] [12] [16] [6]. WikiMa-
trix.org [17], a Web forum for discussion of Wiki engines,
lists 46 separate systems. The size of a Wiki is usually
measured by article count, but several other options exist
[7], which include:
 Total size of Wiki in bytes
 Total equivalent pages in A4 paper
 Total number and frequency table of words
Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for
personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are
not made or distributed for proﬁt or commercial advantage and that copies
bear this notice and the full citation on the ﬁrst page. To copy otherwise,
or republish, to post on servers or to redistribute to lists, requires prior
speciﬁc permission and/or a fee.

 Number of articles in diﬀerent byte size ranges, such
as 50, 250, or 1000 bytes
 Size of articles N/L, 2N/L, ... LN/L where N is the
total number of articles and L is the number of lan-
guages in which articles are written
The largest Wiki by all measurements is the Wikipedia,
an online collaborative encyclopedia project [4]. It utilizes
WikiMedia Foundation’s GPL–licensed engine, Mediawiki
[15], as does SensorWiki.org. While some Wikis require
a short registration process for editors, as of writing the
Sensor Wiki does not. 1 The advantage of Wikis as com-
pared to traditional websites is that information can be
quickly shared amongst all the interested members in a
given ﬁeld or community. Structured Wikis like Sensor-
Wiki.org attempt to combine this open nature with the
format consistency and ﬂexibility of a database applica-
tion [14].
While some of the information compiled and developed
by research labs is proprietary, there is an abundance of
material that would be made public if the proper forum for
its release were made available. The Sensor Wiki project
is just such a forum.
2. EXISTING RESOURCES
There is much published research about sensors [11] [3].
Papers (for instance [1]) and more recently a book [8],
address musical applications of sensors. Although these
resources are useful because they have undergone a rigor-
ous editing and review process, most of what is available
stops short of providing speciﬁc data, such as information
on sensor purchasing (where, how much), as this informa-
tion changes often. This is also true for publications in
journals and conference proceedings.
To ﬁnd practical information, one must usually conduct
online research to determine what is available for a given
task, compare speciﬁcations and prices, and ﬁnally make
contact with a company and place an order. But enter-
ing the word “sensor” into a search engine such as Google
yields millions of superﬂuous results. The process is not
only extremely time-consuming, it is often repeated un-
necessarily because the information gathered each time is
not organized and preserved.
The creation of a resource tool about sensors in music
is an ideal application for a Wiki system for several rea-
sons: It serves as a single place to gather resources and
1As there has not yet been excessive amounts of vandalism,
a registration process has not proved necessary. If spam
and editing by “bots” becomes an issue, this point will
need to be reconsidered.

information, it allows and encourages members of diﬀer-
ent institutions to share their ﬁndings and discoveries, and
ﬁnally it can be updated quickly and easily as new infor-
mation becomes available. It is then complementary to
other sources of information, such as articles and books.
3. SENSORWIKI.ORG
The Sensor Wiki is located at www.sensorwiki.org, and
is currently organized into three sections:
 A comprehensive list of sensors, each with their own
sensor description page.
 A database of references on interfaces and interac-
tion.
 A section containing detailed tutorials related to sen-
sor interface design.
3.1 Sensor list
Sensors in the list are organized in categories accord-
ing to the physical phenomenon they sense, for instance,
rotary position, linear position, or force/pressure/strain.
Figure 1: A screen shot of part of the sensor list
in the Sensor Wiki.
If a sensor can be used to sense more than one phe-
nomenon, it is included under each category for complete-
ness. However, this is only a repetition of the link; each
leads to the same sensor description page.
Figure 2: A typical list of topics covered for a par-
ticular sensor.
Each sensor description page includes:
 An introductory paragraph where background is pro-
vided and general issues about the sensor are dis-
cussed.
 A section describing the practical use of the sensor,
including ways of constructing conditioning circuits,
mounting techniques, and type of signal output.
 A list of companies that oﬀer this sensor, including a
data sheet, price list, and link to the company’s site.
 Media featuring the sensor, such as images, video,
circuit diagrams, and CircuitMaker [2] simulation
ﬁles.
 External links and a reference list of resources used
in the writing of the article.

cially available, where to ﬁnd them and prices –

3.2 Reference List
The list of references started as a duplicate of the
online resource Interactive Systems and Instrument De-
sign in Music Working Group (ISIDM), meant to pro-
vide a knowledge-base for researchers and workers in the
ﬁeld. Although the information included in the original
knowledge-base hosted at ICMA (International Computer
Music Association) and later at McGill is invaluable, it is
incomplete and diﬃcult to update (it is a standard HTML
webpage and not editable by the public).
It is here proposed that Sensor Wiki provides a much
better forum for this knowledge-base, as references are
easily added and edited, and the discussion pages allow
public communication on changes or direction.
Like the original ISIDM webpage, the Sensor Wiki
knowledge-base provides links and references for the fol-
lowing topics:
 Evolution of interactive electronic systems
 Interaction & performance
 Sensors & actuators
 Interface design
 Mapping
 Software tools
 Dance technology
Each topic consists of three sections: Introductory Ref-
erences, which introduces the topic to beginners, clariﬁes
some of the vocabulary used, and provides references and
links to published work that outlines the topic, an exhaus-
tiveBibliography in Computer Music Journal format, and
an Internet Directory, linking to useful resources available
online. We hope that by moving the ISIDM to the Sensor
Wiki we will achieve the level of collaboration originally
intended by the working group [5].
3.3 Tutorials
SensorWiki.org also includes tutorial pages oriented to-
ward guiding a reader through speciﬁc projects from be-
ginning to end. These are usually prepared by individuals,
and subsequently edited in minor ways. Initial examples
include an overview of basic sensor interfacing techniques,
and a lucid and complete tutorial on integrating the USB
with microcontroller projects.

sensor interface, by Mark Marshall.
3.4 Applications
It is hoped that this ﬂexible and comprehensive resource
will prove useful for researchers who wish to use sensors
in their projects. Since it is hosted by a music technol-
ogy research lab, the Wiki’s content tends to be music-
oriented, however the information it provides is also useful
for robotics, installations, interactive dance systems, and
research in a host of other ﬁelds.
Reasons for joining the Sensor Wiki project should be
clear — the project will allow everyone in our commu-
nity to beneﬁt from the knowledge and experience of their
colleagues. In the same spirit that the NIME and ICMC
conferences foster research, new innovation and collabora-
tions, the Sensor Wiki will allow individuals and schools
working in the ﬁeld to grow and learn faster together than
they could apart.

4. FUTURE EXPANSION
The future direction and expansion of the Sensor Wiki
project will depend heavily on groups and individuals not
associated with the IDMIL or the Music Technology Area
of McGill University. Although the initial contributors
guided the design and formatting of the Wiki in a two-
year development process, the content provided thus far
is intended to merely initiate a dialogue and sharing of
information that will beneﬁt all of us equally, and the basic
design and layout may change according to the suggestions
of new users.
More accounts of individual experiences with the inter-
face design process are much needed. Backgrounds on mu-
sical instruments, commercial controllers, and experimen-
tal designs could also be included. Plans for expansion
over the coming year include a comprehensive list of ac-
tuator technologies to match the sensor list, as well as
overviews and tutorials on haptic feedback systems.
5. CONCLUSIONS
Already, SensorWiki.org is a valuable repository of sen-
sor information; as of writing there are approximately 49
”legitimate content pages”, with over 33,543 page views.
Other institutions have begun linking to the site, such
as the University of Oslo, the University of Washington’s
Center for Digital Arts and Experimental Media, Stanford
University’s Center for Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics, and the Department of Music at Columbia Uni-
versity. We invite researchers and all individuals who wish
to share their expertise to participate in the development
of the Sensor Wiki. With broad participation, it could
serve as a central place for open music technology infor-
mation, a summary for students new to the ﬁeld, and a
valuable resource for students, hobbyists, and researchers.
