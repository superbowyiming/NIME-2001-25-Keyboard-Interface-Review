ABSTRACT
This paper presents a participatory design process with
the Xamb´ a community to create new Digital Musical In-
struments (DMIs) emphasizing the integration within their
music culture. The project yielded two novel instruments,
the Agbaixo, and Bot˜ oes Falantes, engaging the community
in every stage and considering the traditional instruments’
entanglements in the materiality, corporeality, and sonorities
of their music culture. This process was inspired by
Paulo Freire’s dialogical methods. It was conducted with
community members of several ages and musical experience
in a workshop over two months. The designed instruments
were preliminary evaluated by community members in an
informal context. The implications of this work, apart from
creating instruments in conjunction with their final players,
include an attempt to inspire a new bottom-up design process
centered on existing communities situated in specific music
cultures.

1. INTRODUCTION
NIME Research has traditionally been carried out within
specific socio-technical, cultural, and economic contexts,
predominantly in Western 1 universities and companies,
where access to financial and technological resources is
often abundant. These instruments frequently emerge from
a research process centered on technical implementation
concerns rather than their situated musical outcomes within
their cultural contexts [19, 15].
Engineering perspectives that prioritize technical features
such as optimization, accuracy, or integration challenges
of advanced sensors can lead to the creation of devices
that, while technologically sophisticated, may not resonate
with the practices and traditions of musical communities.
Although we recognize the importance of such technical
advancements, it is through its use in a social context
that an instrument becomes musical [41]. These processes
tend to happen on large time scales, through complex
and unpredictable relations between the many agents that
constitute a cultural context, but how can we consider these
socio-cultural dimensions in the design process of new DMI?
This paper presents a participatory design process of two
new DMIs conducted with the Xamb´ a community, a Brazil-
ian quilombola community with a music practice deeply
intertwined with social life, political resistance, and religious
practice [16, 2, 9]. A quilombola community is formed by
mainly black Brazilian individuals who maintain a strong
cultural and historical identity and collectively fight for their
socio-cultural rights [11]. This participatory action research
[10] was inspired by Paulo Freire’s dialogical methods; based
on a participant observation practice, we engaged with the
community to analyze and codify elements of their music
culture. This thematic analysis served as a starting point
for the planning and facilitating a participatory process
based on their materialities, sonorities, and corporealities as
a strategy to cultivate new instruments in this rich music
culture.
1Although the concept of “West” has no single or simple
meaning, we consider it a historical socio-political concept
(not a geographical) based on Stuart Hall’s definition which
considered an inherent mythical and fantastical dimension
to the concept, usually associated to a “type of society that
is developed, industrialized, urbanized, capitalist, secular
and modern”, which has always included Western European
countries, the USA, sometimes Japan and usually considers
Latin America to be “struggling not very successfully to
catch up” [17]
2. THE SOCIO-CULTURAL DYNAMICS
OF DMIS
The discussions around the socio-cultural role of technology
in digital musical practices have been gaining momentum in
recent years [37]. New organological frameworks encourage
us to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of instruments,
considering not only the sounds they produce (sonorities) but
also acknowledging their cultural dimension, their gestural
repertoire (corporealities), and material culture, amongst
other aspects [27]. Ecosystemic perspectives have suggested
“a musical instrument is not an object but a process” [41],
shifting our perspective from objective notions ofinstruments
towards a relational instrumentality, a quality dynamically
negotiated within cultural contexts [18].
Ignoring the socio-cultural dimension in a design process
may cause us to miss an essential aspect: it is the process
of playing an instrument in a situated cultural context
that makes it a musical instrument. Certain fundamental
concepts tied to the practice of music with new instruments,
such as skill, were identified to be dependent on an existing
community of practice [28, 14].
Recent papers at the NIME conference have highlighted
the need for critical discourse incorporating socio-political
dimensions of music technology [19, 31, 4, 39]. Estab-
lishing the NIME Latam Network [29] offered a concrete
understanding of the challenges and potential of creating
an inclusive international network amidst diverse cultural
contexts. However, despite the growth of NIME research
from non-Western perspectives [3, 40, 29, 20, 35, 24, 32,
23], an existing Eurocentric bias still perpetuates limiting
dominant narratives [19].
Escobar’s Pluriversal Design theory, grounded on the
concept of ontological design [42], celebrates the notion of
a pluriverse. This pluriverse advocates for the co-existence
of diverse worlds, contesting Western norms of universal
knowledge [12]. While Escobar acknowledges musicians as
key in keeping thepluriverse alive, we argue that the creators
of new instruments, including luthiers and inventors, also
play a meaningful role in this endeavor.
Digital technologies have accelerated the pace of global-
ization, intensifying its effects of homogenizing and erasing
traditional practices of marginalized communities. We un-
derstand the transformative potential of this work to subvert
the role these technologies play against the hegemonic top-
down approach, from “the West” to “the rest”[17]. Through
this participatory action research [10] in a racialized commu-
nity2, we advocate for a bottom-up decolonial resistance by
designing digital technology for music as a quilombola effort
to keep the pluriverse alive.
3. XAMBÁ COMMUNITY CONTEXT
The Xamb´ a community is a Brazilian quilombola community
located in the Urban Quilombo 3 Port˜ ao do Gelo on the
outskirts of Olinda, Pernambuco, in the northeast region of
Brazil. They were officially granted the title of an Urban
Quilombo for their collective actions to preserve their history
and identity through the Terreiro de Candombl´ e Na¸ c˜ ao
Xamb´ a4, their main religious ceremonial space [25]; for
2We understand race as a process of oppression, based on
Anibal Quijano’s category “Coloniality of Power” [34], which
“operates from the racialization of relations across social and
geocultural identities” [36].
3Quilombo is the name of the geographical territory that
integrates the quilombola community.
4Candombl´ e is an Afro-Brazilian religion of oral tradition
based on worshiping their deities, called Orix´ as. A v´ ıdeo of a
creating the Memorial Severina Para´ ıso da Silva (M˜ ae Biu)
(a museum inside the terreiro [33]); for building the Centro
Cultural Grupo Bongar: Guitinho da Xamb´ a, their cultural
center; for holding each year the Coco de M˜ ae Biuparty5,
where they maintain the Coco da Xamb´ a6 tradition alive;
and for the actions of the music group Bongar[21].
Grupo Bongar 7 has played an important role in these
efforts, having strategically worked to valorize and dissemi-
nate the community’s culture through music [2, 1]. Being
one of the most prestigious Coco groups in the World, they
play the Coco da Xamb´ a genre and compositions based
on their religious music [9]. They respectfully innovate
their traditions by blending profane and religious elements
and experimenting with other styles and instruments from
outside, such as the piano, cavaquinho, guitars, and bass.
They recently have included a DMI: the Roland SPD-S
sampler pad.
The community’s interest in engaging with new musical
technologies opened the possibility for dialogue in this
participatory design process. The decision of one of the
Bongar’s members (Th´ ulio Cl´ audio de Albuquerque Nasci-
mento, Th´ ulio Xamb´ a) to use an SPD-S was motivated by
the practicality of transporting fewer heavy instruments and
exploring new sound possibilities. They use the instrument
to play sounds that traditional instruments cannot, like a
sub-bass sample from an 808 kick drum, some congas with
specific effects, and some recorded voice audio samples.
There are other issues related to this instrument, such
as it being too expensive for the community’s economic
reality. Another group member (Jo˜ ao Alberto Santos Silva,
Beto Xamb´ a) bought the same instrument but did not
integrate it into his instruments set, feeling it didn’t work
as a familiar percussion instrument. Even though this
instrument represents an opening of the community to
the DMI world, we believe a process to create new digital
instruments based on their context has many interesting
opportunities to be more affordable and better integrated
into their music practice well beyond their expectations with
DMIs.
4. METHODOLOGY
A relationship of friendship came before starting this re-
search. We had collaborated with Thulio before on a
musical performance with custom-made DMIs. Based on the
admiration for the Xamb´ a community music, this project
was proposed to go beyond individual collaborations to
a collective approach with the community. Seeking a
methodological approach that would help us center the
process around their cultural context in a respectful and
profound way, we conducted a participatory design process
inspired by Paulo Freire’s educational philosophy, his concept
of dialogics, and the methodology of thematic investigation
[13]. During the process, we did not try to have a distanced
perspective; on the contrary, we tried to have a horizontal
dialog with the

community based on mutual trust. During the process, we
positioned ourselves as participant observers, suggesting as
much as listening to the participant’s suggestions.
Four months before starting the Design Process, the first
author (Tragtenberg) started a Participant Observation
practice through percussion lessons with Th´ ulio Xamb´ a,
traditional instrument-making lessons with Iranildo Gomes
da Silva (Iran Silva), and attending public community events
such as the Coco da Xamb´ a. Th´ ulio played a pivotal role
in the planning phase, sharing his knowledge about the
community’s music practice and inviting all the participants
to the workshop.
The demand for this design process did not come from
the community but from the researchers. To evaluate if this
proposition was interesting for the community, we hosted
an event at the cultural center to experiment with DMIs we
had previously developed.
They played with Giromin [3, 38], Probatio [7], and
Controllerzinho [6], along with their traditional instruments.
Thirteen people attended this informal event, and within
just a few minutes of testing the instruments, they were
already jamming and having a great time. This enthusiasm
demonstrated a potential interest in participating in the
design process.
We organized the process in the format of a workshop
called Creating Electronic Percussion Instruments , which
lasted 2 months, having two sessions per week. This work-
shop was organized by two main facilitators: Tragtenberg
and Th´ ulio Xamb´ a; Two assistants from the community:
Anderson Luiz Paraizo Pinto (Ninho Brown) and Paulo
Henrique Louren¸ co da Silva (Henrique Bongar); A somatic
educator: Orun Santana; Two sound designers: Miguel
Mendes and Tom´ as Brand˜ ao Correia (TomBC); and the
executive producer: Laura Proto. During the process, 29
participants from the community attended (11 women and
18 men, all of them black, of which 9 were below 13 years old
and one person with physical disabilities). 12 participants
attended only one day, and the number of attendees each
day fluctuated significantly, ranging from 2 to 14 people.
All 6 Bongar musicians attended at least one day of the
workshop.

ment prototypes at the community’s cultural center, Centro
Cultural Grupo Bongar: Guitinho da Xamb´ aduring the
Workshop Creating Electronic Percussion Instruments.
The workshop participants were invited personally by
Thulio Xamb´ a, who was active in one or more of the collective
activities of the Quilombo. From the participants who
attended more than 2 days of the workshop (59% of all
participants):
• 100% contribute to the activities of the cultural center;
• 94% of play at least one of the instruments in Table 1,
most of them having learned in religious or community
contexts, with few having had formal music training;
• 88% live within a 1km radius of the cultural center;
• 76% participate in the Terreiro de Candombl´ e Na¸ c˜ ao
Xamb´ a;
• 3 participants had personal laptops, and 2 could bring
them to the workshops;
• Only 1 participant (Tarta de Melo) had experience with
DIY electronics, having built a driving game controller
with an Arduino;
The workshop process began by conducting a survey of
the most important instruments for the community. We
did this by asking the participants to draw the three they
most liked/wanted to play and then selecting all that were
voted on by at least 2 people. We also included instruments
that were part of the instrumentation of Coco da Xamb´ a
and Grupo Bongar, which were the most relevant musical
practices for the workshop participants. This list is presented

4.1 Thematic Investigation
From the thematic investigation we carried out, we raised
three transversal generative themes to approach the design
process: materialities, corporealities, and sonorities 9. The
design techniques we applied were chosen to approach these
three themes.
4.1.1 Materialities
From the participatory observation of the traditional
instrument-making classes with Iran Silva, we analyzed
which materials were used and which tools to make what
shapes and forms. The process was focused on making an Al-
faia, the instrument most people voted for in the workshop’s
initial survey. We also increased our understanding of their
musical material culture through the drawings people made
during the process to generate ideas for new DMI. Some
elements that emerged from these were many cylinders, rims,
pads, caba¸ cas(gourds), and buzios (conch shells).
All these materials were made available at the last idea
generation stage and the “Prototyping within material
culture” part of the Design process (Figure 1).
9All generative themes were considered in the plural, un-
derstanding these aspects within this community are not
homogenous, but diverse and dynamic.
4.1.2 Sonorities
We organized musical experimentation sessions with our
available electronic instruments throughout the process.
Since most people who attended the workshop had never
played any DMI before, these moments of free exploration
would give them some reference to what is concretely possible
with digital technology. We presented some DMIs developed
by the first two authors (Giromin [3, 38], Pandiv´ a [3],
Controllerzinho/Batebit Controller [6], and Probatio [7])
as well as commercial gear the sound designers of our team
had: TomBC’s Ableton Push 2 10, Moog SubSequent 25 11
and Antares Auto-Tune Artist 12 processing voice; Miguel
Mendes’ Sequential’s Prophet 08’ Desktop 13 and Novation
Bass Station II 14; Th´ ulio Xamb´ a’s Roland SPD-S15 and
Beto Xamb´ a’s Roland SPD-SX sampling pad16. Although
these instruments did not have a specific relationship with
the community’s music culture and were very expensive, we
decided to use them for experimentation since they were the
only DMIs we had available on the team to broaden their
knowledge of what are design possibilities with electronic
technologies.
Another important step was to digitize the community’s
instruments by recording a sample pack. We noted from the
observation how they considered it important for the digital
instruments to sound “organic”. Miguel Mendes structured
the studio process, where they recorded each one-shot sound
three times for each three different velocity levels, to capture
their natural variations; Loops of traditional rhythms and
one-shots. Miguel used Ableton Live to program samplers to
be played with MIDI Controllers, using an LFO to change
between each sample and a velocity mapping to give the
sampler instruments a more “organic” feeling.
4.1.3 Corporealities
Inspired by the Soma Design Framework [22, 30], we imple-
mented a process of Somatic Education before every idea
generation process to include the body in the creative design
practice. The facilitator was Orun Santana, a contemporary
dancer and musician of Afro-Brazilian references.
Participants greatly appreciated these activities, which
helped bring many insights regarding the other generative
themes of sonorities and materialities. One activity he
facilitated involved the improvisation of mappings between
free gestures and sounds. He helped us understand how peo-
ple’s mappings were related to percussive gestures triggering
percussive sounds. From that observation, we noticed how
sampling could be an interesting sound production strategy
for the instruments.
After each prototyping session, we also used a somatic
technique to evaluate the instrument by improvising gestures
and vocalizing sounds. Many interesting ideas came from
this technique.
4.1.4 DMI Design Technical Classes
As well as basing the process on a bottom-up approach
through the three generative themes, we also followed a top-
down initiative, giving introductory lessons on techniques
of DMI Design (mechanical structure, Arduino program-
ming, sound design with Pure Data, and sensor technology)

through the Controllerzinho teaching toolkit [6]. These were
aimed at providing a technical dimension of the possibilities
for the participants.
Many difficulties arose from these lessons: only two
participants had computers (which were very slow), the
available projector from the cultural center had low visibility,
and people had difficulty learning to program because of
the language barrier of the C language (no one could
understand English), and they had little familiarity with
using a keyboard and mouse since their access to the digital
world was mainly through mobile phones.
After accepting these limitations, we focused these lessons
on showcasing sensor possibilities rather than making them
program. We selected some accessible sensors with low
cost and for fast prototyping that could resonate, from
our perspective, with the community’s corporealities and
materialities:
• Buttons
• Piezos (pads and silent drum heads with triggers)
• Capacitive touch sensors
• Reflective IR distance sensors (TCRT5000)
• IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units)
• LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors)
• Potentiometers
These sensors played a crucial role in the ideas generated
and in their prototyping. We limited the ideas to those that
could be implemented with these sensors so that they would
be fast, inexpensive, and easy to prototype later.
4.2 Idea Generation Process
All the idea generation techniques were inspired by the
concept of instrumental inheritance. Calegario proposed a
method based on this concept, where it should be used to
“explore and generate ideas based on common knowledge and
existing cultural hooks, serving as an initial, structured, and
exploratory path for idea generation”. Instead of augmenting
or emulating existing instruments, this method suggests
existing instruments as inspirations for designing new DMIs
[5]. We also adapted the Brain-Writing (6-3-5) method [26]
to the context of each idea generation session.
The facilitation of this process was incrementally enhanced
by introducing restrictions at each step, which were designed
to consider specific instruments as creative guides. These
guides aimed to stimulate the integration of new DMI ideas
into the traditional repertoire of instruments. Given that
these instruments were coherently related, being part of the
same music culture, we combined them in various ways.
Instead of writing ideas, we preferred to ask them to draw
and prototype with materials so we could also learn about
their material culture’s imaginary 17 throughout the process.
4.2.1 Individual Free Drawings Inspired Collec-
tively
In this technique, 7 participants were seated in a circle, each
with five minutes to generate an idea for a digital instrument
on a sheet divided into eight sections. Following this, the
17“ways in which people collectively and pre-theoretically
make sense of their social and personal existence, to con-
stitute a collective space of meanings or semantic space for
co-being” [43].
sheet was passed to the adjacent participant, who had five
minutes to develop a new idea inspired by the one already
on the paper. This process was repeated until a total of 49
instrument ideas were generated.
4.2.2 Drawings in Pairs with Restrictions
On a different occasion, the group of 4 participants was
divided into pairs. Each pair chose 2 or 3 instruments
from the community’s instrument list to inspire a digital
instrument design within 30 minutes. Subsequently, they
were asked to repeat the process on another large sheet of
paper, resulting in the conception of four instrument ideas,
including the Agbaixo instrument (Figure 3).
4.2.3 Instrument Taxonomy Survey
During this activity, 8 participants categorized the com-
munity’s instruments, identifying a taxonomy consisting
of: skin-based instruments (low-pitched), shakers, and high-
pitched instruments of Table 1. It is interesting to point out
that the piano was included in the category of high-pitched
instruments. This highlights how the concept of notes is
not so relevant to this community, which probably tends to
consider all percussive sounds from the timbral perspective.
Although the piano has a big extension from low to high
pitch, its function in their music probably plays a role closer
to the other high-pitched instruments on the table. This
taxonomy reveals a very interesting aspect of this community,
which would radically diverge from a Western classical music
perspective.
4.2.4 Drawings in Trios Inspired Collectively with
Restrictions
8 participants were organized into three groups to draw on
large sheets divided into three parts, with ideas restricted to
the category and the condition that the instruments would be
playable on the street, an aspect in which most instruments
in Table 1 follow. Each group had 30 minutes per drawing
before passing the sheet to the next group. Each sheet
represented an instrument category, serving as inspiration
based on that category and the ideas generated earlier in
the process. In total, nine instrument ideas were proposed
through this activity, including the initial draft of the Bot˜ oes
Falantes instrument (Figure 4).
5. RESULTS
From the 62 instrument ideas conceived, concerns arose
about selecting a specific instrument for further prototyping.
However, only two participants attended on the day desig-
nated for creating cardboard prototypes with selected ideas.
Curiously, each one was fixated on an instrument idea that
had captivated their imagination, which became the starting
point for the Agbaixo and Bot˜ oes Falantesinstruments. We
respected this spontaneous response from them instead of
forcing them to do the previously planned design activity.
5.1 Agbaixo
The Agbaixo 18 instrument emerged from the Drawings
in Pairs with Restrictions technique inspired by the Agbˆ e
and Berimbau, incorporating a cut-in-half caba¸ ca (gourd)
18Video of a Demo of Agbaixo by Miguel Mendes:

Figure 3: Pictures of the Agbaixo’s design process and final
version. From top to bottom, left to right: the initial drawing;
the cardboard prototype; current version
from an Agbˆ e with functionalities reminiscent of the eight-
bass (known locally as oito baixos) accordion, a widespread
instrument in Brazil’s Northeast. Its name was given by
Ninho Brown, derived from combining the names of the
Agbˆ e andoito baixos.
It features eight large buttons for triggering percussion
samples with the right hand (probably inspired by the
Controllerzinho buttons) and eight smaller ones for playing
bass notes with the left. The cardboard prototype did not
change much since it remained bidimensional due to the
difficulty of shaping the caba¸ ca (gourd) with that material.
The final prototype was made by cutting a large gourd in
half and attaching the buttons, considering what was learned
from the materialization generative theme. During the
process, we would sometimes meet in other informal contexts,
and while Ninho Brown was fixated on that instrument idea,
he mentioned an insight about implementing Ableton Push’s
“repeat” function into Agbaixo, where the small buttons
would select the repeat pattern and the bit buttons would
select the sample to be repeated.
The electronic circuitry was built with an Arduino Pro
Micro on a protoboard, which we programmed and designed
the protoboard schematics based on the collectively chosen
features, and the participants from the community assembled
and soldered. Due to limited time and resources, the
instrument was programmed as a MIDI controller to play
the sound-designed Ableton Live sample instruments instead
of embedding the DSP for sound generation.
The definition of which samples to be used was conducted
by Miguel Mendes and the participants from the community.
Based on its initial conception of the buttons on the left hand
playing bass sounds and the right hand playing percussion
sounds. Miguel would show many possibilities of bass sam-
ples he had available on his computer, ranging from acoustic
basses to synth-basses sounds. The participants chose a
Prophet 08’ Desktop sample-pack Miguel had recorded
previously from his synthesizer. Considering most of the
community had little experience playing melodic or harmonic
instruments, Miguel opted for arranging the buttons on a
pentatonic scale, seeking to minimize dissonances between
notes.
From a “non-Latin” perspective, using a Prophet synthe-
sizer bass sound may seem artificial for a Latin American
community with no tradition of playing synthesizers. We
understand traditions as a dynamic set of agreements,
which evolve in time depending on individual and collective
decisions from within each community. We took the tra-
ditional instruments as inspirations for the new ones but
also brought many references from existing commercial and
DIY gear. Latin American cultures have had a tradition of
hybridization we acknowledged and accepted as an important
part of the design process [8]. The participants from the
Xamb´ a community had an open mind for experimenting with
new possibilities, having shared or individual tastes for what
sounded interesting or not. We respected their choices and
stimulated them in a search for interesting new possibilities
without trying to force them into a rigid perspective of what
their culture is.
For the percussion samples, Miguel chose with the partici-
pants the samples of the instruments previously recorded by
themselves. The eight buttons would trigger samples from
the Alfaia, Ganz´ a, and Snare Drum sample instruments.
These were triggered through the MIDI protocol in Ableton
Live using the “Drum Rack” module. Each MIDI note trig-
gered a different Sampler module with 3 different selection
“zones”, each with a recorded variation of the same gesture
on the acoustic instrument. A low-frequency oscillator
(LFO) at 1Hz would select a different sample, emulating
the natural variations a percussion instrument has across
many repetitions of the same intended gesture.
To implement the “repeat” function, we added another
red button to its front so the tempo could be sensed using a
“tap tempo” control. This mode would immediately make
the LED from this button blink on tempo. The repeat mode
would be turned on by this action or could be turned off back
into the original trigger mode by holding the red button for
3 seconds. This mode would disable the bass samplers from
the left-hand buttons, changing their function to select the
repetition pattern (with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 16 even divisions
of the tapped tempo) of the last button selected on the right
hand. The first author programmed these time divisions in
the microcontroller firmware based on what was collectively
decided; since the time divisions weren’t decided, he made
these choices and validated them with the community, which
agreed with these decisions.
5.2 Botões Falantes
Bot˜ oes Falantes19 consists of a structure with 3 trigger
buttons that could shift their pitch if the lateral structure is
bent, similar to a talking drum. It means “Talking Buttons”
in Portuguese, and this name was proposed by the first
author and agreed with the participants. This instrument
emerged from the “Drawings in Trios Inspired Collectively
with Restrictions” idea generation process. It was the first
drawing from a group for a digital low-pitched instrument
inspired by the “low-pitch” category (Table 1. The trio had

and final version. From top to bottom, left to right: initial
drawing; cardboard prototype; current version
and sound production, they suggested a small cylindrical
pot with 2 buttons to play very low-pitched sounds.
One of the members of this group, Joheliton Miranda
Albuquerque (Joheliton Miranda), was very excited about
this instrument and frequently mentioned how amazing the
simple idea of this instrument was. He is a percussionist
from the Maracatu Estrela Brilhante, a tradition that usually
performs during carnival, and plays a very heavy Alfaia
while walking for kilometers with his group. He had polio
in his childhood and has a physical disability on a leg that
demands the use of appropriate orthosis. When asked if he
had difficulty walking with such a heavy drum, he said it
was no effort. Even so, it is interesting that this instrument
is an accessible solution for people with motor disabilities
to play in Carnival parades.
For creating the cardboard prototype, Joheliton used a
cardboard cylinder a little longer than he had drawn and
was available at the workshop. While testing it on his body,
he liked the affordance of it being holdable near an armpit,
freeing both hands to play. Ninho Brown immediately men-
tioned it resembled a talking drum, an African percussion
instrument. The first author suggested implementing the
feature to pitch shift the samples. The group liked the
idea and spent some days thinking about the possibilities of
adding this frequency shift control feature. While Joheliton
was considering using a rotary potentiometer, Tragtenberg
investigated the possibility of using reflective IR distance
sensors.
Considering possible flexible structures allowing the dis-
tance sensor to detect how much the instrument was bent
on the sides, Diego Gomes Melo (Tarta de Melo) proposed
using a 100mm PVC sewage pipe, which is 2mm thin in
Brazil. It is interestingly flexible if cut in a low-height ring.
He suggested this material as a sustainable solution since
it is easy to find the remains of this pipe on construction
sights. It is relevant to point out that Tarta works mainly
as an electrician and a generalist construction worker. By
using available plywood and some wood slats, we built the
structure using wing nuts and screws. This structure allowed
the reflective IR distance sensor to measure the distance
between the two opposing wood slats.
We later added a 3rd button to trigger samples and another
red button to change between three sample pages, allowing
it to play nine instead of three different sounds. To add
sensitivity to how strong the buttons were struck, we also
added two 17mm ceramic piezoelectric discs near the buttons
to add velocity sensitivity. The first author implemented the
firmware based on the collectively defined features. As one of
the three buttons was pressed, the intensity was measured by
detecting the maximum value in a 10ms time window after
the button was pressed. This would compose a MIDI Note
On message with a mapped value for the velocity followed by
a Note Off message. The reflective distance sensor reading
would be mapped to a pitch bend message.
We used Ableton Live’s drum rack module, triggering a
“Sampler” module like in the Agbaixo configuration. Since
this instrument gave different velocity values, we used 9
recorded samples for each Simpler module, which would be
mapped in zones depending on the MIDI velocity, having
3 variations for low, medium, and high intensities gestures,
which would be selected by a 1Hz LFO. Each sample page
was related to one traditional instrument: Alfaia, Engome
Melˆ e (higher pitch), and Engome Ian (lower pitch). Each of
the three trigger buttons would be mapped to three different
recordings of gestures (for example, the mallet hitting the
rim, the drum head, and multiple fast strikes on the drum
head).
Although most of the electronic instruments they played
were restricted to being played on top of a table, both
instruments they invented were designed to be portable
like their traditional instruments. The demand for a self-
contained instrument, which had embedded DSP, was a clear
demand that we couldn’t implement during the available
time of the workshop. Although it was acceptable for them
to have an instrument that could not be moved while playing
(like the Engomes, Congas, and Alfaias or Snare Drums when
fixed on stands), the need for a computer was accepted as a
work-in-progress but had a clear demand for a new version
with an embedded sampler.
5.3 Preliminary Evaluation
The evaluation of the 2 instruments was conducted in
an informal community setting, integrating both cultural
context and technical aspects. Delays in development,
especially with embedded DSP and inadequate computing
capabilities for running Ableton Live in computers from
the participants, meant relying on equipment from people
external to the community, which restricted the available
time and depth of testing and community learning.
Initial practical tests were held in Recife’s city center
during pre-Carnival events, where community musicians
used the new instruments alongside traditional instruments.
Feedback from the participants highlighted the instruments’
potential for deeper musical integration, with Beto Xamb´ a
expressing enriched musical possibilities far surpassing those
offered by commercial DMI: “I have already found things to
play, to use, [with Agbaixo]. My head is already boiling with
possibilities. I think it generates in me a desire to include
it [in my set of instruments], even much more so than the
SPD-S, although it has much more possibilities, you did
something that generates in me a much greater desire to
integrate into life.”20.
20Translated by the authors from Portuguese.
There were also some divergent remarks for Agbaixo; while
Joheliton Miranda suggested adding a lever to allow changing
octaves to play more notes, Th´ ulio Xamb´ a suggested chang-
ing the sound design not to play notes, but only percussion
sounds on both hands since it would take a longer time for
them to learn how to play a melodic instrument than a per-
cussion instrument. Nevertheless, these initial impressions
would need more time to be thoroughly evaluated.
These evaluations are first impressions of initial prototypes,
promising but requiring further refinement and extended
testing to realize their full potential. The community’s
proactive role in the continued development, highlighted by
their initiative to establish the BongarBit Lab for ongoing
DMI design, underscores the project’s collaborative nature
and the community’s strong identification and ownership of
the initiative.
6. DISCUSSION
The technical limitation of depending on computers was the
most important limitation of the current prototype. This
dependence on the design team from outside the community
to play the instruments shows a serious limitation of the
project so far. It urgently calls for a new version with an
embedded sampler solution. We understand this limitation
as a step of the research we plan to overcome soon. We have
traced some goals for building incremental autonomy of the
community over their instruments:
• The next step is to allow them to be played by the
community members without the need for people or
equipment from outside;
• After that, to have autonomy to reproduce these
instruments with accessible materials;
• Lastly, For them to have autonomy over the creative
process of new instruments designed by themselves.
Another point we would like to address is the affordance
of playing in walking bands in contexts of Carnival or other
street parades, which would demand the design or use of
a portable speaker system as well as the embedded DSP.
We believe the design process and instruments presented in
this paper are the beginning of the work of Bongarbit Lab,
which has big and exciting challenges ahead.
7. CONCLUSION
This paper presented an intention to diversify the cultural
context in which DMI design occurs. By moving beyond
the traditional Western, academic, and predominantly white
spaces where NIME research is typically conducted, the
study embraces and explores the rich potential of engaging
the Xamb´ a quilombola community. This approach challenges
conventional methods of musical instrument design, which
often lean heavily towards being technologically intensive,
but also enriches the field with fresh perspectives tailored
to meet specific cultural and social needs.
By focusing on a “bottom-up” strategy, the project aligns
technology development with the cultural contexts of the
participants. It is an example of how dialogical processes
based on Paulo Freire’s methodology of Thematic Investiga-
tion can center a design process on the entanglement of new
DMI into existing music cultures.
