Abstract
This paper explores the design and use of a camera-based digital
musical instrument as a thinking tool for considering entangled,
post-human perspectives. The design of the pattern organ, in-
spired by experimental optical sound-on-film practices, employs
a method of visual-to-audio synthesis that responds closely to
the material behaviours captured by its camera input.
Drawing on findings from exploratory workshops and short
material experiments, we describe how interactions emerge and
are shaped by both the physical configuration of the instrument
and the material behaviours captured by its camera. We consider

how frugal mappings and the ‘rawness’ of data can give rise to
instruments whose inputs remain open to material complexity,
extending the sound engine beyond their enclosures.
In the case of the pattern organ, this complexity emerges
through overlapping and interfering interactions, where struc-
tural forms, human influence, light, shadows, lens distortions,
and system quirks all contribute to the shifting harmonic con-
tent of the wavetable. We reflect on the instrument as a fluid
assemblage, composed of human and non-human entanglements,
encouraging us to think beyond traditional notions of human-
centred control.

1 Introduction
In a recent interview discussing the materiality of technical ob-
jects, Katherine Hayles described two ways of reading a book;
“One way is just to immediately decode all the sym-
bols in your mind as you read, and in that case, the
book becomes more or less a transparent vessel.
You’re simply picking up the ideas that the author
put there, and you are processing them in your own
way. But a very different way to read a book is to
pay attention to the texture of the page, the exact
shade of the ink, the kind of font that’s being used,
and in that case, you are combining your under-
standing of the signifiers to an intense attention to
the material form. ” [21]
Offering a post-human understanding of embodiment, Hayles
questions the lines we draw between information and the mate-
rial world, arguing that the world is ‘not a split creature, but a
co-evolving and densely interconnected complex system’ [20].
She proposes a distributed understanding of cognition, one that
flows dynamically between humans, animals and technical sys-
tems [19, 22]. Hayles’s entangled understanding resonates with
Barad’s Agential Realism, describing a world made up ofMaterial-
Discursive Practices , where material and information continually
co-constitute each other [2].
Recent engagement with entanglement theory in HCI and
Music Technology research has seen the emergence of a new line
of questioning, probing at the boundaries and assumptions that
have been sedimented into these fields over time. These inquiries
shift attention towards materiality [39, 55], ambiguity [35, 46] and
amorphous assemblages [6, 51], informing new understandings
of design, composition and performance practice.
Aligning ourselves with these post-humanist theories, we ex-
plore the design and use of the pattern organ, an instrument that
uses minimal mapping, seeking to respond closely to material
behaviours captured in its camera input.
In Section 2, we describe the materialist underpinnings of this
research. We account for the work of the materialist film makers
who explored visual to audio synthesis through experimental ana-
logue darkroom practices. We present recent discourse around
practices and understandings of ‘raw data’, and describe emerg-
ing design practices that aim to attend closely to material and
decentre the human. In Section 3, we present the current design
of the instrument. We describe a shift in our understanding of the
instrument leading to a simplification of the interface, moving
away from a representation of analogue optical sound, and in-
stead leaning into the material peculiarities of a digital system. In
Section 4, we outline a method for 2 workshop studies exploring
interactions with the instrument. In Section 5, we present five
entangled observations arising out of these workshop studies.
We further considered the instrument in a different setting, con-
ducting three short interaction experiments, linked in Section 6.
In Section 7 we reflect on the design and use of the instrument
through the lens of entanglement as material-discursive prac-
tice, where patterns constitute themselves within a continually
shifting apparatus. Where behaviours, relations and attentions
reshuffle, setting the conditions for new patterns and interactions
to emerge.

2.1 Audification
“patterns are built up , intricate patterns, patterns
of waves, ready to be transduced into sound. ”
Daphne Oram on magnetic tape, An Individual Note
[41]
In the context of NIMEs, the sonification of camera data could
be understood as falling into two categories. The first involves
extracting features from image data to trigger or modulate sound
parameters. This approach is evident in projects like the re-
acTable [30], or audiovisual installations such as Akiko Hatakeyama’s
chitose momotose [18] among others [ 8, 13, 17, 32, 40, 43, 47].
Another approach makes use of ’audification’ [23], where each
pixel’s luminance data is more directly translated into audio
signals, with minimal intermediary mapping. The first form of
sonification affords a higher degree of intentional control and
the ability to work with a wide spectrum of sounds. Audification
can be limited in sonic palette, but offers a direct translation
of visual micro-structures into audio at a waveform level. Both
abstracted and unmediated mappings offer fertile ground for en-
gaging with materiality, tangibility, and post-humanist thought.
This paper focuses specifically on the audification of camera data,
approached through a materialist and entangled lens. To frame
this perspective, we draw on analogue materialist film-making
practices, particularly those exploring optical sound.
The audification of image and light sensor data has been a
recurring theme in Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design [1,
10, 16, 24, 37, 42], and has been further popularised in recent
years through the work of contemporary artists such as Ryoji
Ikeda [25] and Electronic Fantasticos [11]. One-to-one mapping
between luminance and amplitude has been used to investigate
processual crossovers between image and sound that open up
new sonic and visual synthesis possibilities [29, 53, 54].
2.2 Materialist Optical Sound Film-making
This research is part of a wider project around analogue opti-
cal sound practices. Optical sound is the principal method for
recording and playing back soundtracks in analogue cinema. As

illustrated in Figures 2 and 4, optical sound allows audio infor-
mation to be printed and read as a continuous graphic wave-
form that spans the film strip. From the late 1920s, audio engi-
neers have experimented with replacing optically recorded wave-
forms with graphic ornaments, employing cut up, resampling
and physical modelling techniques to explore hitherto unknown
sounds [7, 27, 31, 50].
In the 1970s, optical sound met with a further period of radical
experimentation. Members of the London Film-Maker’s Co-op,
[4] were exploring ways of subverting the film apparatus by
dismantling the boundary between the image and the printed
soundtrack. Peter Gidal, a founding member of the co-op, pub-
lished a ‘Theory and Definition of Structural/Materialist Film’ in
1978, calling for film-makers to step away from creating illusory
‘phantasies’, and instead seek to understand a film work not as
a reproduction or a representation, but as ‘a record of its own
making’ [14].
This materialist thinking was prevalent among members of
the co-op. Optical sound artists Lis Rhodes and Guy Sherwin used
a sweeping range of techniques and materials to explore patterns
and synthesise sound in their films, shown in Figure 3. Lis Rhodes
used letracet, discarded typewriter ribbons, hand-drawn lines and
computer generated patterns to synthesise sound optically in her
works [34]. Guy Sherwin produced a huge number works making
use of both camera-less and in-camera techniques [ 33, 49]. In
‘Musical Stairs’, Sherwin filmed a staircase, employing methods
that spilled the image into the soundtrack area of the film. Tilting
the camera up and down, and adjusting the aperture of the lens,
he could play with altering pitch and amplitude.
“The fact that the staircase is neither a synthetic im-
age, nor a particularly clean one (there happened to
be leaves on the stairs when I shot the film) means
that the sound is not pure, but dense with strange
harmonics. ” [48]
Optical sound and enlarging and shrinking filmic processes
give film-makers tangible access to the minute details of an audio
signal. Our research explores this concept through the design and
use of a digital instrument that employs audification, preserving
the ’rawness’ of sonified data.
Figure 4: An illustration of an averaged one-to-one lumi-
nance to amplitude mapping
2.3 Raw Data
Recent music technology research argues that preserving ‘raw-
ness’ of data through minimal mappings or frugality of compo-
nents can lead to playful interactions, by leaning into ambiguity
and the messiness of a signal [5, 6, 45, 46]. Exploring the use of
electromyography (EMG) signals as a performance tool, Reed and
others assert that their understanding of ‘rawness’ of a sensor sig-
nal does not assume a closer proximity to the sensed (in their case,
the body). Instead, rawness can be defined by ‘a simple refusal to
infer conceptual meaning from the signal through digital feature
extraction’ [45]. Bowers and others have developed a design ap-
proach that emphasises ‘rawness’ of materials and data, creating
artefacts which ‘stay close to the materials from which they are
made’. They propose that a frugal, perhaps aesthetically brutal
approach can enable ‘interrogation of human/non-human rela-
tionships, performativity, musical ecologies, aesthetics, and other
matters’ [6]. These ’monstrous assemblages’ make up ’zones of
entanglement’ that work in unexpected ways, challenging the
notion of tidy dataflow from source to destination.
2.4 Materiality and Decentring through
Design
A materialist turn in Research Through Design is challenging the
notion of materials as passive objects, acknowledging material
‘vitality’, and calling for approaches that decentre the human.
In ‘The Textility of Making’ [26], Ingold describes the making
process as ‘a matter of finding the grain of the world’s becoming
and following its course’. Elsewhere this has been termed ‘en-
abling material drift’ [15]. Considering this in a digital context
reframes the practice, ‘moving beyond representationalism and
perceiving the performative unfolding of a situation of mate-
rial’ [39]. Nicenboim and others assert the importance of a close
attention to material in regards to digital media; ‘Given that the
materials used in design are evolving into complex assemblages
of both humans and non-humans - such as data and algorithms
- it becomes essential to consider how practices of attunement
might be extended to broader temporal and physical scales’ [38].
In this light, smaller, situated experiments can serve as crucial
sites for developing these attunements, thinking beyond static
objects and fixed contexts.
3 Designing the pattern organ
"The real voyage of discovery consists not in seek-
ing new landscapes, but in having new eyes"
Marcel Proust (sic [52])
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia J. Butt
Figure 5: An illustration of the initial instrument concept
Mikael Wiberg uses this paraphrased Proust quote in his book,
The Materiality of Interaction [52] to emphasize a shift in per-
spective from the pursuit of novel artifacts to a re-examination
of existing technologies through a new lens. In this research,
the design process and design artefact became thinking tools for
exploring entangled perspectives. The pattern organ was initially
intended to be a digital metaphor of analogue optical sound tech-
nology. It makes use of a one-to-one luminance-to-amplitude
mapping in order to closely couple the sound engine with ma-
terial inputs. As we will explore in this and later sections, the
perception of the instrument has shifted over the course of the de-
sign process, although its core operation has remained relatively
unchanged.
3.1 Pure Data Patch
The pattern organ comprises a Raspberry Pi running a Pure Data
(PD) patch which processes graphics using the Graphics Envi-
ronment for Multimedia (GEM). The patch takes a 1-500 pixel
variable horizontal slice from the middle of a 2448 x 1080 pixel
live camera feed. To construct a wavetable, the mean average
pixel luminance across the height (y dimension) of the slice is
computed for each x pixel, resulting in a one dimensional array
that refreshes at the camera’s frame rate. This process is illus-
trated in Figure 4. This dynamic array is normalised to a float in
the range -1.0 to 1.0, and written into a wavetable, to be scanned
at a controllable speed. The graphical interface, visible in Figures
15 to 17, shows a black and white slice of the camera feed, a
visual graphic of the one dimensional array, and a visualisation
showing the shape of the shifting wavetable.
The pattern organ has limited active controls, including:
• Output volume
• margin (changes the height of the matrix slice taken)
• blur (smears data in time - between frames)
• frequency (a course frequency control of the wavetable
scan rate)
• capacitive touch - currently uses a Trill sensor for fine
control of the wavetable scan rate.
Using a USB camera that has manual lens control allows for
further passive control of the visual / audio signal, through zoom,
aperture and focus. The pattern organ is an open source design.
Pure Data patches can be found here. A demonstration of the
zoom, focus and margin controls can be seen here.

3.2 Simplifying the Interface, Enabling
Complexity
The instrument’s original concept emerged out of the lead au-
thor’s analogue optical sound film practice, and a desire to bring
features of this practice out of the darkroom and into live work-
shop settings. Due to close proximity with analogue film practice,
the original form of the instrument embodied certain skuemor-
phic features, such as a sprocketed mechanism. Initially, the
instrument was embedded within a table-top mechanism that
used 3D printed sprocketed gearing adhered to a belt, illustrated
in Figures 5 and 6. The intention was for the instrument to read
patterns that were drawn onto or adhered to long strips of paper
(the sprocketed paper serving as stand-in for celluloid film). Fur-
ther design iterations retained a table-top configuration, using
a light box and a pinch-roller mechanism to explore flat, paper
patterns.
Responding to observations made in the workshops, described
in Section 5, the decision was made to permanently uncouple the
machine from any paper transport or table-top configuration. The
interface was simplified to a control box, a graphic interface and
a manual lens camera that can be fixed to a mount, or hand-held.
As we explore in this paper, moving away from skeumorphism
and simplifying the device in this way set the conditions for dif-
ferent kinds of complexity to emerge. What initially appeared as
a process of de-constraining the camera interface, introduced a
new, shifting web of constraints. The key difference of this uncou-
pled interface was a fluidity of structure: the instrument became
more able to expand and extend, adapting to its environment and
reconfiguring itself to capture patterns in the world, while also
allowing for direct interactions with hidden behaviours within
the digital system.
4 Method
Through a loosely structured qualitative analysis based on the
method outlined here, this paper builds toward a larger diffractive
analysis, providing a basis for a future diffractive reading of these
observations and reflections.
The pattern organ was used to run five workshops in confer-
ences and community settings in 2024. Two of the workshops
were recorded as part of formal studies. Each was set up slightly
differently, but both involved using the instrument to explore
a range of materials laid out on a table. Next to these materials

Figure 7: An image from the first workshop, containing
some of the prompt cards used to inform early interactions
were a series of prompt cards, visible in Figure 7, reading: phase,
distort, pitch, decay, vibrate, tremolo, vibrato, saturate, filter, fold,
sample, sequence, feedback, stretch, crumple, fade, ripple, pucker,
offset, smudge, blur, copy, collage, strobe, spin. Often deliberately
ambiguous in their referring to audio or visual media, these words
were chosen to inspire thoughts around audio-visual-material
correspondences.
Pre-CHI, UWE, Bristol, UK. April 2024 was a 2 hour session. 8
Participants attended. Participants were invited to openly collab-
orate and discuss as they explored different materials under the
camera of the instrument, which was initially set up in a table-top
configuration, pointing at a light box. The wavetable was set up
at a consistent 64 Hz scan rate. The value was not chosen specif-
ically, but was tuned to a low frequency with a potentiometer.
The instrument settings were kept the same throughout, so that
changes in sound were solely a result of interactions captured
by the camera. Discussions in this workshop occurred in tandem
with participants’ interactions.
NIME, HKU, Utrecht, Holland. September 2024 was 3-4 hours
long, with 7 attendees. It differed from the Pre-CHI session in
that it placed more emphasis on individual exploration of the
prompt cards. We used two later iterations of the pattern organ
(referred to as the ‘toneLamp’ at the time of the workshop). This
time, the scan rate of the wavetable was controlled by a Trill
capacitive touch sensor [ 3], so that participants could choose
their own speed and pitch while they explored the instrument.
The sensor had been damaged in transit and was behaving er-
ratically for the first half of the workshop, but could still output
constant scan speed when pressed firmly. The participants were
asked to choose a word from the prompt cards and to investigate
the instrument in relation to the word. They were then asked to
reverse this process, choosing a material and exploring the audio
parameters or characteristics that it afforded. Discussions in this
workshop happened in a round table format at points throughout
the workshop.
Transcripts were made from audio recordings captured at
both workshops. Interactions were recorded through a screen
recording at Pre-CHI, capturing the graphic interface of the in-
strument. Still and moving image documentation were recorded
at key points during the NIME workshop. To aid in reflection
and comparison, transcripts separated engagement into individ-
ual interactions. These were defined by moments of participant

inactivity, material being taken out of the frame, setting down
the camera, and discussions pausing or changing tack entirely.
Techniques were used to deeply familiarise the lead author with
the recorded data, such as post-workshop discussions, hand tran-
scription and graphic time stamping and coding. Collectively
considering and discussing this material weekly over a period of
months, nebulous observations gradually coalesced into clearer
reflections, described in Section 5.
Rather than framing this as a process of finding underlying
patterns, we approached these materials as sites of differential
becoming, tracing how the instrument enacted itself differently
across moments and contexts. Inspired by diffractive method-
ologies, we paid attention not only to what appeared stable or
shared, but to reconfigurations of meanings, roles, and agencies
that occurred across these intra-actions.
Building on these observations, a series of short material exper-
iments were conducted, described in Section 6. Each experiment
was centred around a different medium: Salvaged cans, sand
and torchlight. These experiments were not designed to test hy-
potheses or confirm insights from the workshops, but to explore
different unfoldings of the instrument in a quiet, solo setting,
offering opportunities to attend to subtle shifts in attention and
material response.
5 Five Observations from the Workshops
Though broken down into parts, these five observations are all
related and overlapping, constituting a larger whole.
5.1 Ambiguity and Self-Sustaining
Interactions
Longer interactions were marked by uncertainty about the source
of changes in the output. Both workshops began with the instru-
ment in a tabletop configuration, the camera facing downwards
onto a lightbox. In both workshops, a noticeable shift occurred
when the camera was redirected to capture the surrounding
environment. Before this, interactions were mostly under one
minute long. Afterward, increasing numbers of participants and
materials became enfolded into the interactions. Features of the
room, patterns on transparencies, the diffused shape of torch-
light all overlapped, windowed and obscured each other to create
one integrated pattern, scanned into the instrument’s wavetable.
Figure 9 shows an example of this layered interaction. These
interactions were sustained for increasing lengths of time, from
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia J. Butt

lights.
3 minutes up to 15 minutes. Previously, interactions ended when
materials were intentionally removed from view. Now, they were
sustained by a continuity of visual and sonic textures, with in-
creasingly ambiguous sources. Every movement would alter the
timbre of an ongoing drone, and participants became suspended
in the interaction, engaged in constant discussion, exploration
and investigating the sources of change, and noticing increasing
unexpected, peripheral patterns. Moments of confusion some-
times shifted attention to features of the environment.
“you’re making more of a difference”
“oh me?”
“no I don’t actually think.. ”
“we have got the light above us as well so if we.. ”
5.2 Shifting Attention and Peripheral Patterns
As attention became more cyclical, moving between material,
sound, and image, unexpected patterns and material behaviours
began to surface. Early workshop interactions often began with
comments about intention or material qualities, and concluded
with a comment on the sound.
In one instance, when the camera was removed from its table-
top mount, participants appeared tuned in to one element at a
time, even as other elements visibly and audibly influenced the
output.
The patterned carpet was explored sonically while being sig-
nificantly obscured by participants’ own shadows; shadows that
went unacknowledged. Later, while using transparencies and
torches to project shadowed patterns onto the floor, participants
discussed horizontal arrangements for clearer sound, without
noting the vertical carpet pattern underneath.
As interactions continued and participants encountered fea-
tures beyond their control, comments began to shift less pre-
dictably between material, sound, and image. For example, a
Figure 10: An illustration of interdependence in a manual
camera lens
feature of the sound would draw attention to the graphic inter-
face, which would in turn draw attention to the material, light,
system or environment.
“there’s a drone underneath us”
The speaking participant twisted the camera to line
up with the regular grey and white pattern of the
ceiling tiles. Seen in Figure 9
5.3 Prompt Cards, Parameters and Intentions
The prompt cards, as seen in Figure 7, often created rigid inten-
tions that did not allow space for open exploration.
The NIME workshop placed more emphasis on prompt cards,
involving less open and collaborative exploration of the instru-
ment. Participants were encouraged to choose a card or two, and
explore it using the materials in the room. Although the cards
were introduced to inspire curiosity, many of these early tabletop
interactions were marked by disappointment. The words on the
prompt cards encouraged interactions that often clashed heavily
against the limitations of the instrument. The constraints of the
prompt didn’t allow space to respond to emergent behaviours of
material or instrument, cutting interactions short.
“Yeah I had vibrato and phase, I was interested in
the height as well, so what happens - it gets quite
blurry on top where the focal point is, I was a bit
under-impressed with this one.. ”
“so basically I was trying to create noise in this, I
think it didn’t quite work because I think it’s really
because no matter what you are changing you are
changing the harmonics of it so the fundamental is
determined in a way. And the thing about noise is
its inharmonicity”
“So I started thinking of what could I distort, so it
could be moving the paper in a distorted way or
other things, but for example moving it sideways is
not changing a lot because it’s limited by the frame
rate.. ”

5.4 Material and Spectral Entanglements
Although a manual lens is split into separate rings for zoom,
focus, and aperture, these controls are linked. In a phenomenon
called ‘Lens breathing ’, illustrated in Figure 10, adjusting one
subtly affects the others. This entanglement becomes sonically
noticeable when using the manual lens within the pattern organ.
Perceived pitch, tone, and amplitude are all affected, but not
separately.
“Yeah cause I’m trying to do like a blurring, and like
the focus worked for the blurring but so does the
zoom kind of cause it makes it blurrier and then
the ultra-wide does funny things to the lines.. ”
The camera lens here becomes a site of optical and sonic en-
tanglement. This was not limited to lens control: similar entangle-
ments revealed themselves across interactions. A clear example
appeared at NIME, where a piece of paper was latticed with
scissors, shown in Figures 11 and 12. The instrument produced
varied sonic behaviours from this material: pulse-width modula-
tion, wave-folding, even gated amplitude as the participant ran
out of steam colouring the paper black. These attributes were
entangled in the material itself. Moving or stretching the lattice
affected many sonic properties simultaneously, though only one
when considering the waveform as a whole.
· Lattice
At the Pre-CHI workshop, a piece of striped t-shirt material
was stretched with the intention to alter perceived pitch. Later,
as someone else explored the lens settings, stretching the fabric
revealed the jersey knit of the material. As light passed through
each stitch, high harmonics emerged alongside lower pitches. As
it slipped out of focus, each stich was encircled with a soft bokeh
circle, smoothing the waveform, shown in 13.
5.5 Automation and Emergent System Quirks
The interactions that were sustained for the longest were those
that revealed and then leaned into hidden behaviours of the
instrument. These behaviours were often uncovered using wave-
emitting objects like torches and screens.
In one case, with the instrument back in a tabletop position, a
phone was placed beneath the camera, displaying a subtle colour-
shifting gradient. The mismatch between the camera’s frame rate
and the LED refresh rate created noticeable banding, outputting
an undulating waveform.
“ooh it’s trying to adjust for the frame rate so it’s.. ”
“this is pretty interesting, we’ve got a kind of a strob-
ing feedback screen weird thing. ”
“it’s pretty weird you can actually see the refresh
rate of the light scrolling along and changing the
waveshape. ”
“I wish we were in a room with bad lighting for a
temporary moment so we can see if the flickering
of the lights would affect it.. ”
“do you mind if we, does anyone mind if we tem-
porarily turn the lights off?”
Figure 14 shows a moment at the NIME workshop where
a feedback loop between two instruments sustained a fifteen-
minute experiment. Torchlight, narrowed with fingers, was used
to explore the impulse response of a cascading wave of harmonics.

6 Material Experiments
In response to observations and reflections from the workshops,
we conducted three material experiments with the pattern organ,

exploring salvaged cans, sand and torchlight. Stills from video
documentation can be seen in Figures 15 - 17, and videos with
descriptive captions are linked below:
· Salvaged Cans
· Sand
· Torchlight
During the can experiment, considerable time was spent in-
vestigating the ambiguous source of a momentary high pitch.
The can was crumpled in places, creating irregular areas of light.
The sound seemed to come from both these reflections and a
printed E, whose horizontal white stripes created a small portion
of regularity in the waveform, visible in Figure 15. Hearing a
pattern on an automated, motorised loop allowed us to tune in
to the rhythmic spacing of the graphic design as well as sonic
artifacts from the crumpled can’s history of wear and tear.
Though unintentional, we had pre-loaded each material with
expectations of possible sonic affordances. This was especially
the case with the sand experiment, as the act of raking sand was
immediately evocative of a cultural aesthetic that seemed to im-
plicitly encourage a gradual, mindful approach. This expectation
led to a spike of disappointment responding to the overpowering
sound of the wooden rake tool. Attending to the sound, and mak-
ing space for it, placed the tool at the centre of the interaction.
The sound of this tool became composited with the sound of the
ridges left in the sand. This prompted further thoughts about the
use of mark making tools to entangle sound actions [ 28] with
recorded sound.
The emergence of a system quirk prompted a new experiment
involving torchlight. The torch, tall and stable enough to stand on
end underneath the camera, made for a surprisingly hands-free
interaction, while the visual banding of the rolling shutter effect
sustained a pulsing tone. This automation lent space and time to
tune in to the unfolding behaviour of the instrument, adjusting
the instrument settings and using the manual lens.
7 Discussion
7.1 Beyond Control: Enabling Material Drift
In moving away from separate control of defined parameters like
’amplitude’ or ’timbre’, and instead influencing the waveform as
a whole, the instrument made space for unfolding spectral entan-
glements that were bound up with different material behaviours.
This helped to embrace mutual influence of human, machine, en-
vironment and objects. Through the three material experiments,
we engaged in a process of tuning in to a new configuration of

behaviours of simple objects.

rial [39], and enabling material drift [ 15], we were able to em-
brace the differences between co-emergent material behaviours,
side-stepping a traditional notion of control and user-centred
interaction. Though de-centring the human ’user’, these inter-
actions were rich with unexpected behaviours and discoveries

that prompted creative thought, encouraging exploration of the
material history and embodied information in discarded objects,
entanglements of material and gesture, and hidden system be-
haviour.
7.2 Fluid Assemblages and Complexity
Grounding this research within an entanglement paradigm helped
us to recognise the instrument’s lively and unstable edges, seeing
its different configurations as a continuous, dynamic process of
mattering.
The ongoing design process, coinciding with the workshops,
involved a rethinking of the interface as a boundary drawn be-
tween the ’material world’ and the ’sound engine’. Through un-
derstanding the camera as a vital and vibrant part of the in-
strument, we were able to explore its agency within the appara-
tus. Previous design iterations treated the camera as a transpar-
ent window, passing details of an image into the sound engine.
Through uncoupling the camera from a fixed enclosure and the
use of a manual lens, the camera becomes a powerful actor in
the instrument’s apparatus, greatly extending the possibilities
of the system, and allowing us to zoom into the finer details of
material and spectral entanglements.
Taking a situational viewpoint, we can see that the instrument
came to matter differently in different environments. For ex-
ample, collaborative Pre-CHI workshop involved multi-layered
interactions that gathered in optical complexity, allowing for
diffractions, interference, and layers of patterned obstruction,
shadow and reflection. The material experiments on the other
hand resulted in a probe-like instrument that examined emergent
audio-visual couplings with different objects.
We found that some of the most compelling interactions turned
the instrument’s focus in on itself, revealing diffracted features
of its inner architecture through glitched, or mal-functioning
behaviours. These investigations brought the instrument closer
to the practices that inspired it: those of the materialist film-
makers who worked to dismantle and explore the film apparatus
through diverse approaches and constant experimentation, in-
volving minute gestures or vast landscapes, but always with an
aim of illuminating the materials and processes involved in the
making itself.
Through understanding the analogue film equipment as as-
semblages, rather than totalities, the materialist film-makers dis-
covered an endless world of re-configurations, characterised by
emergent properties. This approach, aligning with Redström and
Wiltse’s notion of Fluid Assemblages [44], has been a vital touch-
point when considering how we ourselves might design fluid
instruments with re-configurable constraints that can attune
themselves to different material complexities.
7.3 Future Work
This ongoing re-configuration also applies the outcomes of our
research. Over the course of this work, the pattern organ became
a thinking tool for exploring entangled interactions. As Frauen-
berger points out in writing on Entanglement HCI; [12]; had we
conducted a controlled user testing study in a lab, the pattern
organ may have become a functional tool, or a cultural artefact
if subject to an interview study.
The work presented here is part of a larger research project
exploring analogue optical sound practices. Through engaging
with the experimental film community, we are gathering accounts
of materialist film-makers’ understandings and practices. These
accounts will be read through material from workshops and our
ongoing design process using diffractive methods [36]. One lim-
itation of this research can be found in the time constrained
interactions with the instrument. In future research we will ex-
plore lengthier processes of composing and performing with the
pattern organ, delving into the implications of entangling mate-
rial, choreographed interactions and structured sound, using a
4Es model of cognition (embodied, embedded, extended and en-
active) [9]. We are also planning to investigate patterned making
techniques, where the pattern organ is explored with a focus on
the sonic possibilities of different material crafting processes.
8 Conclusion
The entanglement paradigm takes a step beyond a focus on
embodiment and gestural control, de-centring the human in a
way that destabilises our understandings of interaction. Under-
standings of Human Computer Interaction are already subject
to strange new forces in the wake of rapid technological and
social change. This instability offers an inroad for new research,
inviting researchers to attune themselves to entanglements, and
challenge thinking that aligns with a traditional notion of control.
What are the implications of interaction design within the
paradigm of a distributed locus of agency ? How can we decen-
tre the human while acknowledging that we ourselves and our
own boundary-drawing practices are intimately bound up in the
world’s becoming, and that we have ethical responsibility for the
unfolding of networks, assemblages, discourse and environments
that make us what we are?
Frauenberger proposes that in order to deepen our understand-
ing of the mutual dependence between humans and objects, we
might lean into material-centred interaction design, and explore
the notion of fluid assemblages, creating ’hybrid things with am-
biguous boundaries and proposed programs of actions that seek
to reconfigure agency and power with moral responsibility’.
In this research we use the design and use of a camera-based in-
strument as a way of re-framing our understanding of interaction
design. We explore an interface that enables material drift and
acknowledges non-human agency, attuning itself to complexity
within the environment. The camera’s capacity to entangle with
its environment allows the apparatus to expand and contract,
drawing attention to complex, layered patterns of difference. This
work highlights the expansive potential of a materialist approach
to digital musical instrument design, where repositioning our
understanding of agency invites productive engagement with
unfolding material and spectral entanglements.
