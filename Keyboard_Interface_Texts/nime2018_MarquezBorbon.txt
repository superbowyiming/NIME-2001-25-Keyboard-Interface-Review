ABSTRACT
This paper addresses the prevailing longevity problem of
digital musical instruments (DMIs) in NIME research and
design by proposing a holistic system design approach. De-
spite recent eﬀorts to examine the main contributing factors
of DMI falling into obsolescence, such attempts to rem-
edy this issue largely place focus on the artifacts estab-
lishing themselves, their design processes and technologies.
However, few existing studies have attempted to proac-
tively build a community around technological platforms
for DMIs, whilst bearing in mind the social dynamics and
activities necessary for a budding community. We observe
that such attempts while important in their undertaking,
are limited in their scope. In this paper we will discuss that
achieving some sort of longevity must be addressed beyond
the device itself and must tackle broader ecosystemic fac-
tors. We hypothesize, that a longevous DMI design must
not only take into account a target community but it may
also require a non-traditional pedagogical system that sus-
tains artistic practice.

1. INTRODUCTION
Within NIME practice and discourse two issues drive an
important part of research agendas: instrumental longevity
and virtuosity. Common assumptions assert that any in-
strument/interface that achieves some sort of longevity will
necessarily provide the required conditions to achieve in-
strumental virtuosity [2, 28, 27]. While both are extremely
complex issues, in this paper we will focus on the former as
it presents broader implications for musical practice within
NIME and related ﬁelds.
Adoption and longevity of novel musical devices are long-
standing problems, despite the ever increasing number of in-
struments, interfaces, and technological platforms for music

produced every year [20], whether in academic or commer-
cial domains. Most cases are limited to bespoke systems for
individual use or as research probes [28], resulting in DMIs
from past conferences whose longevity is only maintained
either anecdotally or as paper citations [28].
Beyond NIME, these problems have also been addressed
in the public sphere, citing that very few DMIs have ever
sold at least one unit [28] and seemingly implying that not
many will reach the public eye [25]. Certainly these are
not easy issues to tackle due to the multiple factors that
come into play within the broader ecology in which par-
ticular DMIs are developed and deployed [27]. Comparing
DMIs to traditional music instruments may not be the best
approach either due to the extensive histories and musi-
cal practices behind a particular acoustic instrument, such
as well deﬁned repertoires and pedagogies developed over
decades, if not centuries. This is a matter not only of in-
strument design, but of established musical practices. We
cannot directly compare in this respect a violin to the Hands
[39] or even further, compare a violin to an augmented vio-
lin in this way [30].
Because we identify longevity as a complex issue, we ﬁrst
need to discuss how our view of technology in this domain
leads us to overlook signiﬁcant and emergent relationships
that are developed from and in response to a DMI in a par-
ticular context. As Marquez-Borbon and Stapleton discuss
in their accompanying commentary [24], the causes of a lack
of established performance practices in NIME can be par-
tially attributed to the constant pursuit of novelty and a
lack on engagement with distinct communities: “We sus-
pect the primary cause is a lack of connection to sustained
and emerging real world performance practices, and a lack
of engagement with academic and professional communities
that sustain these practices. The “N” in NIME itself is per-
haps partially to blame, in that it resists the long-term de-
velopment of performance pedagogies, repertoire and critical
discourse necessary for the legitimisation of a performance
community within the wider NIME community.”
This paper aims to shed light on some of those relation-
ships, arguing in favor of the development of performance
practice through the enactment of non-traditional musical
pedagogies and communities of practice.
1.1 Technological Determinism in the Context
of Music Technology
The predominant discourse within NIME prizes technolog-
ical advances by means of functional and implementation
issues [12]. It could be argued that technological determin-
ism tacitly permeates NIME research objectives. Certainly,
as [19], and [15] explain, technological advances symbolize
190
progress and modernity, while simultaneously reducing the
user to a mere component of a system. Following develop-
ment in the ﬁeld of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI),
there is an increasing emphasis on rationality and control
where interactive systems are abstracted in order to deter-
mine its operators and products [16, 37].
This view is evident in the historical developments of
computer music and new musical interface design where
early research concerns focused on the technological devel-
opments of the time, as well as on the implementation of
music theory, artiﬁcial intelligence, and cognitive science
in computer systems [33]. Bryan-Kinns [5] observes that
these initial concerns obscured the examination of other
issues such as interaction, group/social activity, or alter-
native practices that depart from the traditional composer-
performer-audience model. In this manner, the musical sys-
tem took precedence over the user as a research concern. As
Richard [36] explains, such developments attempt to mirror
scientiﬁc and technological progress. Similarly, in contexts
where music technologies are employed, the technological
aspect is placed above musical activity along with its socio-
cultural and historical factors [43]. (Figure 1) shows the
diﬀerent changes in research paradigm shifts within NIME.
1.2 Setting up the Problem
Regarding the longevity of DMIs, i.e. whether the interac-
tive music systems are being used in artistic performance
situations for prolonged periods of time and beyond their
research purpose, we might be tempted to ask “why are
some DMIs more successful than others?” The question,
we believe, should be reframed. Rather than focusing on
the particularities of design such as heuristics or evaluation
methods [28], we should be searching at both the commu-
nity and ecosystem level.
We further observe that focus still lies on assessing as-
pects of NIME communities which are centered on success-
ful community formation and sustainability by means of
crowdfunding, platform establishment, and appealing tech-
nological capacities [28] building. However, being NIME a
“community-of-communities”[24], we must consider whether
any of these communities are indeed establishing a relation-
ship between DMIs and potential performers outside the
academic context of NIME. Therefore, the question remains
on the development of a performance.
2. PREVIOUS RESEARCH
In this section we will present examples of current research
investigating how design and community building foster the
longevity for a particular technological platform. We con-
tinue our discussion by presenting how learning is done
within the context of computer music and NIME.
2.1 DMI Design and Longevity
Recently, Morreale and McPherson [28], presented the out-
comes of a survey investigating the factors that inﬂuence
the success and failures of DMIs in order to formulate a de-
sign framework addressing instrumental longevity. Results
from this study show the diversity of motivations for de-
sign, as well as the limited target users for any given DMI
(mostly for the designers themselves). Also of importance
are the limited contexts and opportunities for performances
exhibited by the survey. As shown, very few DMIs are (fre-
quently) performed in public and are mostly limited to one
user (again, the designer). These results are particularly
striking given the global aim of the community. While the
work of the authors above does not further inquiry into the
reasons for these results, we consider such trends to be sig-
niﬁcant hurdles to the broad uptake of DMIs at larger scales
and with wider user-bases.
2.2 Community Building: Case studies
The existing communities within NIME play a fundamen-
tal role for the creation, establishment, and prolonged us-
age of DMIs. As reported by Morreale et al., [29] the suc-
cessful uptake of the Bela Platform consisted of a series of
stages in which Bela evolved from being a custom hardware
board for the D-Box (a hackable DMI, [45]) into a platform
and toolkit used by a growing DMI designers and enthusi-
ast community. This was achieved by gradually support-
ing established software used by other communities within
NIME, such as Pure Data and SuperCollider, and eventually
launching a crowdfunding campaign with successful results
[29] . Although it is in fact remarkable to approach com-
munity sustainability by means of empowering and merging
with other like-minded communities, as well as establishing
connections with their members, it is still arguable whether
the preservation of such platforms may prolong the usage
of potential DMIs that might embed them in actual perfor-
mance practices.
In a similar manner, Patchblocks [18], was developed with
community interactions in mind, such as their creative pro-
cesses and the share and adaptation of ideas. As analyzed
in [24], such social factors are integrated in the design of
Patchblocks leading to the collaborative development of the
interfaces’ technology. In this case, the social aspects of mu-
sic performance practices are a primary consideration to the
artefacts design, which purposefully integrates communal
activities of knowledge development, as well as a collabora-
tive music-making.
From these two cases we can observe how taking a com-
munity element into consideration can serve diﬀerent pur-
poses, such as increasing awareness and spike public interest
to support community formation or to inform the design of
artifacts that support collaborative interactions. Nonethe-
less, a common factor between both cases seems to be the
presence of communal learning processes happening in both
collocated and distributed spaces, such as workshops and
online forums, respectively, in which novices and experts
concur as supporters and facilitators. However, a broader
performance-pedagogy ecosystem seems to be missing from
the scope of research and practice of communities within
NIME.
2.3 Learning (with) DMIs
Throughout the years NIME has developed a curriculum
encompassing diverse design, implementation, and evalua-
tion practices for DMI development [22]. Here we will limit
our discussion to learning for musical performance.
The rationalization and operationalization of DMI de-
sign practices and philosophies introduced the concept of
‘learnability’ as an additional element to be considered and
evaluated [42]. However, this concept, deﬁned as the “time
needed to learn how to control a performance with a given
controller” (ibid), reduces the complex process of learning
to a mere function of time. Learnability in this manner
follows the notion of expertise within the conservatory tra-
dition where invested time in practice is the principal factor
in learning. That is, amassed practice time directly corre-
lates to the achievement of expert performance [8].
In addition, within NIME it is recognized that develop-
191
Figure 1: Paradigm shifts within NIME
ing performance practices is particularly diﬃcult due to the
quickly evolving nature of technology and its obsolescence
which make establishing performance practices, including
repertoire, challenging [30]. The nature of DMI designs,
their simplicity or complexity, may inhibit investing in nec-
essary practice and learning [5], which is further compli-
cated by the lack of formal structures for learning how to
play DMIs [41]. To this end, performance pedagogy is re-
duced to transmitting formalized knowledge [1, 35] and/or
simply knowing the system’s functionality [3, 23].
Whether the concept of learnability is directly related to
Western musical pedagogy is not entirely obvious; however,
what is important is to note how these cultural and intel-
lectual movements further inform some of the pedagogies
employed in this context. In this manner, the conservatory
music tradition becomes the dominant pedagogy by de facto
and without critique simply by being immersed within that
culture [38].
The few observed attempts to establish learning methods
and pedagogies within NIME exhibit such inheritances. The
studies presented here identify the problem of longevity and
address it through a learning perspective. For example,
Fels and Hinton [9], and Oore [31] provide descriptions of
the learning experience of glove-based gestural controllers.
The former study emphasizes the quantitative changes in
performance along with the amassed practice time of 100
hours. The latter study, while also shows an investment
of 100 practice hours, describes the learning as a complex
process from the perspective of the performer given the self-
directed nature of the task. Butler [6] and Zybyszynski
[46] developed what they deemed etudes and methods for
DMIs. These materials are analogous to those existent for
acoustic musical instruments. These cases are important
because they attempt to establish speciﬁc practice criteria
for fostering prolonged engagement with DMIs.
3. ADDRESSING LONGEVITY THROUGH
EDUCATIONAL ECOSYSTEM DESIGN
Perhaps the most signiﬁcant challenge for developing a per-
formance practice for DMIs is time. This concern is product
of comparing the evolution of acoustic music instruments
and DMIs [32]. We consider time alone to be insuﬃcient for
providing longevity or persistence of a given DMI because,
as an abstract measure, it does not provide the necessary
conditions by which diﬀerent tasks and aims are achieved.
Meaning that there is no guarantee of success simply be-
cause we let enough time pass.
However, taking into account the numerous factors that
can be accounted for in the design of a DMI, along with the
multiple stakeholders and contexts of use, can prove over-
whelming if not impossible [27]. One possible path forward
would involve a consideration of the ecology in which the
DMI is situated [32]. The design strategy should therefore
go beyond the artefact and into ecosystem design, particu-
larly the educational ecology.
The educational ecosystem’s purpose is to develop perfor-
mance practices that contain repertoire, pedagogical strate-
gies, and ultimately, following a Community of Practice
(CoP) model [21]), and diﬀerent stakeholders ranging from
novices to experts that engage in mutual activities of learn-
ing. However, Lave and Wenger’s deﬁnition of a CoP does
not entirely ﬁt within the NIME Community of Interest
(CoI), which appears to have neglected how certain aspects
of musical CoPs, such as informal learning environments,
have proved to be beneﬁcial for improving certain perfor-
mance practices, such as improvisation and composition
skills [11].
One relevant example attempting to prompt the develop-
ment of performance practices is the Magnetic Resonator
Piano [26]. This study not only organizes a community sur-
rounding the device, but fosters the development of reper-
toire between composers and performers. In eﬀect, this ex-
ample can be considered as an instance where a learning
ecosystem is being designed and enacted. However, this par-
ticular approach to creating a musical community is limited
to the accounts of the composer as the sole agent generating
materials to the community to perform. Developing musical
practice does not solely rest upon composers to expanding
an instruments’ repertoire. Using a CoP approach to learn-
ing grants all members the opportunity to participate in
the co-creation of practice. As seen in alternative musical
practices, such as improvisation, multiple stakeholders take
part in the creative activity. In this light, diﬀerent musical
practices must be considered in order to maintain activity
and relevance [14].
3.1 Pedagogical Design and Performance Prac-
tices: Non-traditional Pedagogies
As previously mentioned, the cultural context, along with
its normative musical practices, inform both DMI design
and their performances. By extension, this context fur-
ther informs pedagogies which by their deep rooted nature
prove challenging to move away from [4, 38]. To some
extent, Western pedagogy may be regarded as having an
“information-processing” approach, i.e. reducing the teach-
ing and learning dynamic to a mere transmission of knowl-
edge. In this sense, knowledge acquisition is abstracted to
a point in which the learning experience is decontextual-
ized from its social aspect. Following this trend, the West-
ern music conservatory tradition is hierarchically structured
192
and prescriptive, as its pedagogical methods demand ex-
perts to dictate how are musical knowledge and performance
practices transmitted and evaluated.
By contrast, alternate pedagogies embrace the embod-
ied, social, and situated aspects of learning. Recently, ef-
forts have been made to propose pedagogies that counter
the dominant philosophy of music education. Two related
proposals are the ecological [4] and enactive music peda-
gogies [38]. Both pedagogies promote the idea that teach-
ers and learners mutually constitute the learning environ-
ment (physical and social) by engaging in an “open-ended,
communal, and dialogical process of mutual speciﬁcation
whereby knowledge and understandings emerge from the
relational and co-operative (musical) pedagogical ecology
they co-enact” [38].
Teachers, more than being authorities imposing facts,
rules, and techniques, are regarded as facilitators organiz-
ing learning and revealing possibilities to the student. Sim-
ilarly, the student engages in this relationship by bringing
their own ideas, perspectives, and practices. Because of
the nature of cooperation developed here, the group may
develop and enact their own goals, as well as coordinate
themselves through dynamic adaptive processes . The so-
cial is not limited to collaborative and community learning,
but it suggests the diﬀerent ways of engaging with the world
and how these emergent relationships give meaning to our
actions and thoughts [21, 38].
4. DISCUSSION
Instrumental longevity is widely recognized as an impedi-
ment for achieving virtuosity [28, 44]; however, its solution
is not entirely evident despite recognizing its source in the
design of the DMI itself [27, 40]. This poses a problem,
on one hand, given the diﬃculty in identifying and imple-
menting in the design the traits that are signiﬁcant in the
development of expertise. On the other, as previously dis-
cussed, it becomes necessary to develop and foster a commu-
nity which may present a larger likelihood for a DMI to be
widely adapted and therefore show some signs of longevity
in use.
However, the communal aspect further demands an addi-
tional element of organization that promotes performance
practice. Oore, Butler, and Zybyszynski provide example
cases for the transfer and implementation of the Western
music conservatory approach to DMIs. These show the pro-
cess and outcomes of this process. While important in their
eﬀorts, nonetheless they suﬀer from the decontextualization
and artiﬁcially imposed learning materials borrowed from
this particular music tradition. It must be recognized that
developing any kind of performance practice demands a sig-
niﬁcant time investment. As exempliﬁed by the community
building and organizing activities surrounding the Magnetic
Resonator Piano [26], composition and acquiring performer
expertise for a new musical instrument takes time. While
the point being made here is not to say these approaches
have failed, rather it is to recognize their limitations within
the context of NIME.
Learning to play a DMI may not demand following a pre-
scriptive or ﬁxed learning agenda, such as that proposed by
the conservatory tradition, but may take advantage of em-
bodied learning processes [7] organized by ecological or en-
active pedagogies that orient the performer in the learning
task. Additionally, these pedagogies take into account the
informal and imitative learning strategies, common outside
of academic settings [11], that are important in learner’s ex-
perience. By taking an open-ended and co-created learning
environment it is possible to create a community that allows
for the inclusion of multiple artistic practices that may often
be overlooked. This would include co operative music mak-
ing or co-practice where musicians informally meet with the
goal of communicating and exploring musical spaces, musi-
cal coherence, and the roles of materials and instruments
within that context of practice [12].
Similarly, free improvisation, following Borgo, provides
a disciplined way to explore the musical possibilities and
spaces aﬀorded by DMIs. Contrasting improvisation with a
composition perspective [26], we can foresee faster turnaround
times given the diversity of activities and roles the agents
can take in the creative process. In this manner, time may
be eﬀectively reduced because composers and performers
are folded into a single agent, while communal activities
prompt a range of methods for musical production. How-
ever, we must not fall into the trap of taking improvisation
for granted and regard it as “a substitute for work” [10].
4.1 Examples
We have identiﬁed the ecological and improvisation oriented
approach to learning in diﬀerent research studies. These
examples highlight the importance of improvisation as an
explorative, creative, and collaborative practice serving as
foundation for further composition and performance activ-
ities.
For example, in [17], we can observe a remarkable edu-
cational ecology where teachers, researchers and musicians
engaged in the tutelage of the students through a series
of workshops during a large-scale music education program.
Throughout the program the students captured and manip-
ulated sounds by using a series of tools such as recorders,
microphones, maker kits (e.g. Makey-Makey) and software
(e.g. Max patches developed by the researchers). With
these sounds the students created scores for each other and
performed experimental and improvisatory music with them
by using a series of electronic and acoustic instruments they
had made themselves with the kits and other classroom ma-
terials.
In this case we can observe how an enactive pedagogi-
cal approach, where performance practices such as impro-
visation and collaborative composition were carried out by
diﬀerent stakeholders ranging from novices to experts by us-
ing some of the standard DMI design and sound synthesis
practices of the NIME community. Such activities engaged
them in mutual activities of learning, having positive results
for students and teachers. Such informal learning environ-
ments have proved to be beneﬁcial for improving certain
performance practices, such as improvisation and composi-
tion skills [11] and are key aspects of musical Communities
of Practice [21].
A similar ecology is observed in the Digital Orchestra
Project [34], where researchers from three disciplines: per-
formance, composition and music technology developed a
series of DMIs and two idiomatic [Vasquez] compositions
for them. In particular, the authors circumvented the lack
of a performance tradition for these instruments (i.e. estab-
lished techniques and repertoire) by engaging in a series of
improvisation sessions with the DMIs, where their perfor-
mance capabilities were explored and mapped out, resulting
in the development of a notational system that accommo-
dated the particular techniques of the instrument . Having
193
speciﬁc notation for each DMI allowed the composers and
performers to characterize a body of idiomatic techniques
for them to practice and write repertoire with. Addition-
ally, the authors recognize the importance of having docu-
mentation of the interface available as materials for further
development of repertoire by practitioners.
The Magnetic Resonator Piano [26] demonstrates an at-
tempt to establish an ecology of performance through com-
munal practice. This study not only organizes a commu-
nity surrounding the device, but fosters the development
of repertoire between composers and performers. In eﬀect,
this example can be considered as an instance where a learn-
ing ecosystem is being designed and enacted. However, this
particular approach to creating a musical community is lim-
ited. This is due to the account of the composer being the
sole agent generating materials for the community to per-
form.
In contrast, creative agency within an ecological-enactive
approach is granted to all stakeholders and not only to com-
posers. Musical materials, such as repertoire or musical no-
tation, is cooperatively developed through a diverse range
of activities, whether design, composition, and improvisa-
tion (see [13]). Using a CoP approach to learning grants all
members the opportunity to participate in the co-creation
of practice. Additionally, diﬀerent musical practices, such
as improvisation, contribute to maintaining the activity and
relevance of a given musical system [14].
5. FINAL REMARKS
NIME’s main pedagogy already demonstrates enactive and
ecological characteristics. However, this pedagogy is mainly
directed towards the design and creation of DMIs [22], and
not towards developing musical performance with these sys-
tems. Our proposal, instead, is oriented towards the design
of musical pedagogies for musical performance as an ap-
proach to establish the prolonged use of a DMI.
NIME as a broad community provides a good opportunity
for implementing novel pedagogical strategies that foster
values already embraced by its practitioners: imagination,
creativity, exploration, and innovation. To this end, as dis-
cussed by Borgo and Van der Schyﬀ, we can further address
through novel educational strategies issues of inclusion, par-
ticipation, and diversity, as well as challenge institutional
priorities that favor productivity, eﬃciency, and competi-
tion over critique, reﬂection, and cooperation. According
to van der Schyﬀ et al. [38], the enactive approach “also
strongly implies the exploration of ‘alternative’ approaches
to creative musicking [emphasis in original] that develop
the unique possibilities of a given group or individual”. We
identify this approach as a way of engaging with real-world
practices and to look beyond academic and institutional set-
tings. Restating the questions posed by [24], rather than
asking, how do we design a DMI for adoption?We should
ask instead, How does a tool connect to real-world perfor-
mance practices? And, How does the tool engage with both
academic and professional communities that sustain these
practices?
In its current form, a NIME pedagogy of performance
may not be as integrated and structured as its music con-
servatory counterpart given the heterogeneity of interac-
tive system designs and musical practices. However, we do
not interpret NIME’s diversity as a problem. An enactive-
ecological pedagogy is able to accommodate the diversity
of systems (and subsequent practice) without imposing a
rigid, rule-based performance practice like the Western mu-
sic conservatory tradition. Additionally, this pedagogical
approach maintains an open and collectively generated ped-
agogy that adapts to both individual and collective needs, as
well as being responsive to external factors outside of the
community. A NIME performance practice responds and
adapts to the idiosyncrasies of particular DMIs, while be-
ing both informed and informing community and ecological
trends and activities.
