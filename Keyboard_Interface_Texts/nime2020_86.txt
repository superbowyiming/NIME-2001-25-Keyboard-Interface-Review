ABSTRACT
In the ﬁeld of human computer interaction (HCI) the limita-
tions of prototypes as the primary artefact used in research
have been noted. Prototypes often remain open in their de-
sign, are partially-ﬁnished, and have a focus on a speciﬁc
aspect of interaction. Previous authors have proposed ‘re-
search products’ as a speciﬁc category of artefact distinct
from both research prototypes and commercial products.
The characteristics of research products are their holistic
completeness as a design artefact, their situatedness in a
speciﬁc cultural context, and the fact that they are evalu-
ated for what they are, not what they will become. This
paper discusses the ways in which many instruments created
within the context of New Interfaces for Musical Expression
(NIME), including those that are used in performances, of-
ten fall into the category of prototype. We shall discuss why
research products might be a useful framing for NIME re-
search. Research products shall be weighed up against some
of the main themes of NIME research: technological inno-
vation; musical expression; instrumentality. We conclude
this paper with a case study of Strummi, a digital musical
instrument which we frame as research product.

1. INTRODUCTION
Much NIME research is driven by the exploration of novel
technologies applied to the musical context. One interpreta-
tion of the ‘new’ in NIME is that it represents a belief in new
technologies opening up new means of musical expression,
and leading to the creation of new music. This largely de-
pends on advancements in the core technology that under-
pin instrument making, and hence an instrument’s function-
ality and ability to create music. Another main strand of
NIME considers the agency of musical instruments within a

musical context and their inﬂuence on a performance ecosys-
tem [22]. This division is key to what we outline in this
paper asresearch prototype and research product.
We argue that a signiﬁcant number of the interfaces, in-
struments and artefacts created as part of the research con-
ducted at NIME are imagined as research prototypes: their
deployment and evaluation encourages people to reﬂect on
the qualities of the instrument and to suggest limitations or
possible improvements to the instrument. Prototypes direct
people to think about the artefact as a demonstration of a
principle that points towards a future revision [13].
Odom et al. deﬁne ‘research products’[19] as an extension
of the prototype which allow us to better focus on the com-
plex factors that are brought together in human-computer
relationships. In short, research products are a type of arte-
fact in HCI and design research, which match the level of
ﬁdelity often seen in commercially available and everyday
objects, as opposed to the explicitly ‘unﬁnished’ nature of
a prototype. This property allows research products to be
taken‘for what they are, rather than what they might be-
come’, and for researchers to investigate ‘complex matters
of human-technology relations that often involve messy, in -
timate and contested aspects of every day life’ .
In this paper, we introduce the concept of research prod-
uct, and evaluate how it can be applied to NIME research.
We shall conclude this paper with a reﬂection on Strummi,
a digital musical instrument (DMI) which we characterise
as research product.
2. CONTEXT
Prototypes play an important role in both HCI and DMI
research. The prototype can allow researchers to focus on
a particular aspect of interaction, isolating it from its sur-
rounding context, and can inform developments of a tech-
nological system that improve its usability and a users’ ex-
perience. Prototypes are also often quick and cheap ways
of testing an idea.
2.1 Prototype, Probe, Product
Prototypes play a crucial role in the crafting of an artefact:
certain questions about an artefact’s design, particularly
those that relate to tangible experience, are best answered
through observing interaction with a semi-ﬁnished artefact
that has enough of its design in place as to guide the in-
teraction of the user. Based on observation of this interac-
tion the designer can hone their future decisions to better
cater for the kind of experiences that they want to encour-
age through their design. In this sense, prototypes serve to
elicit feedback from the people who use them with the goal
of improving their design in the future [19]. The role of the
prototype is often understood as a means of helping gather
requirements that will inform future designs, whether these
requirements are speciﬁcally known or not [13].

Where prototypes may fall short is in their ability to ad-
dress more complex issues about how a technological device
intervenes in everyday life and how the device itself is con-
ditioned and appropriated by its surrounding context. Pro-
totypes vary in their ﬁdelity. Some are component parts
of a bigger system, others are a full system but are low-
ﬁ or approximate in certain ways: diﬀering in size, ﬁnish,
behaviour and feel from a potential ﬁnal product.
2.1.1 T echnology Probes
When considering the process of co-designing technologies
with users the method of the ‘technology probes’ by Hutchin-
son et al. [10] provides a useful extension of the prototype.
Building upon Gaver et al.’s ‘cultural probes’ [5], technology
probes are deﬁned as lo-ﬁ devices, whose main technological
hurdles are solved, which can be deployed in an everyday sit-
uation to gather information about technology use in that
situation. They are created in order to serve three goals:
the design goal of inspiring users and researchers to think
about new technologies, the engineering goal of ﬁeld-testing
the technology, and the social science goal of understanding
the needs and desires of users in a real-world setting.
Probes get their name from their ability to ‘probe’ a cer-
tain situation and gather information on it. They at once
disrupt an everyday situation and then monitor what hap-
pens after that disruption. Technology probes are not de-
signed to be neutral or invisible devices that can gather
objectively without interfering in an everyday situation. In
fact the power of the technology probe methodology comes
in the recognition of the disruptive impact of a design, and
in using this disruption to inspire users to reﬂect on the
technology and their situation and to imagine possible fu-
ture technologies. In this way technology probes are similar
to the ‘counterfactual artefacts’ as proposed by Wakkary et
al. [21]. Equally, as a research methodology which focuses
on deploying design artifacts in-the-wild in order to learn
something about that environment, technology probes have
much in common with research products.
2.1.2 Research Products
Odom et al.’s ‘research products’ [19] is a response to the
use of ‘unﬁnished’ prototypes in design research:
‘The complexities and challenges in researching
questions about human-technology relations in ev-
eryday life ... suggest that the notion of a ‘proto-
type’ within research may not be suﬃcient’ [19]
They deﬁne a research product as an artefact which is
experienced based ‘on what it is, rather than what it might
become’. This is about the design, deployment and eval-
uation of research artifacts. They deﬁne the qualities of a
research product as follows:inquiry driven (they are de-
signed to provoke users in their environment and to engage
them in an enquiry, but not necessarily one that relates to
the artifact’s design),ﬁnish (their design is complete and
interaction is predicated on what the artefact is as opposed
to what it might become),ﬁt (they must be able to ﬁt into
an everyday scenario and in a convincing manner) and in-
dependent (they can be deployed in the ﬁeld and have the
potential for unsupervised interaction).
Research products as a design concept are a means of re-
vealing how human-technology relations emerge and change
over time in everyday life. A critical distinction between the
nature of prototype and product is that all design decisions
including those related to ‘material, form, computation and
interaction‘ aﬀect an artefact’s ability to conduct research:
the particular manifestation of these qualities of an arte-
fact decide on the precision to which research questions can
be asked [19]. Research products are emphatically distinct
from commercial products - we are not interested in their
commercial potential or how many copies have been made:
they are only designed to fulﬁl a research inquiry. Any simi-
larities with commercial products would only arise from the
shared goals of producing ‘ﬁnished’ artefacts that can be
easily imagined being adopted in real-world settings.
2.2 Prototypes in NIME
There is a focus in much DMI research on the functional el-
ements of an instrument as research contributions (sensors,
mappings, sound model) even though there are many other
aspects of a design that aﬀect performer experience. Due
to this functional focus, the prototype is the most common
form of research artefact at NIME. Prototype instruments
often stand in as a demonstration of a principle and the
types of evaluation conducted with these instruments often
encourages people to reﬂect on the qualities of the instru-
ment and to suggest limitations or possible improvements.
Speciﬁcally, the iterative nature of NIME design and evalua-
tion can lead to a focus amongst designers, performers, com-
posers and audience on how an instrument might change or
evolve, rather than be treated as a ﬁnished artefact.
Prototypes are essential research tools for many areas of
enquiry relating to DMIs. In this paper we are interested
in how we can best categorise the research motivations of
instrument building which includes the creation of the arte-
fact itself, its design process, deployment and evaluation.
In a recent paper by Morreale et al. [18] some of these
motivations were surveyed in the NIME community asking
questions about uptake, number of performances and initial
reasons for creating an instrument. 32% of the surveyed
instruments were created with potential commercialisation
in mind with the rest intended to answer speciﬁc research
questions, test new technologies or meet an artistic desire
of the creator or collaborator.
The evaluation of a prototype is often focused on the arte-
fact itself rather than the environment in which the artefact
is deployed: NIME evaluation methodologies in general bor-
row heavily from HCI experimental design where a single
variable is tested in a controlled situation. However when
dealing with a cultural form as rich and complicated as a
musical instrument ﬁnding the right evaluation framework
is a diﬃcult task [1].
2.3 T owards DMIs as Research Products
There exist several examples oftechnology probes in mu-
sic HCI, including explorations of how an acoustic guitar
can contain its own history through a digital archive that it
builds around itself [2], and studies on the appropriation of
highly-constrained musical instruments [6]. We see research
products as a natural counterpart to the technology probe
approach. The diﬀerences in physical properties of what
is considered a probe or product might be subtle, or even
non-existent, but we see the research product approach as
a ‘zooming out’ to observe the entire ecosystem around mu-
sical instrument playing, rather than probing a particular
aspect of instrument design.
Importantly, research products place an equal emphasis
on non-technical design choices such as materiality, ‘feel’,
and visual aesthetics, alongside the more technical questions
of sensor technology, mappings, and sound-design. Refer-
ring back to Odom et al.’s qualities of a research product,
we discuss how this might transfer to NIME:
Inquiry Driven: This is a quality of research prod-
ucts that we do not need to argue for in NIME - there
is a tradition of inquiry-driven designs in NIME research,
with examples of DMIs designed to explore phenomena of
Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME-20), Birmingham, 2020
447
human-instrument interaction such as style and constraint
[6], action-driven interaction [20], and control intimacy [23].
Research products continue this tradition of inquiry-driven
design, but due to their other qualities can be more appro-
priate for addressing the ‘messier’ questions concerning the
sociocultural role of musical instruments in everyday life.
Fit: This considers how an instrument ﬁts into an ex-
isting sociocultural context. This does not preclude exper-
imental or novel aesthetics, however an instrument cannot
be considered as detached from the wider societal context
it is part of. Research products aim to delicately balance
between being‘neither too familiar nor too strange’ to the
scenario in which they are deployed. When considering ‘ﬁt-
ting’ into a musical context leveraging existing technique,
whether trained or ecological, and addressing existing mu-
sical practices is key.
Finish: This is where Odom et al.’s research products
begin to depart from the values inherent in NIME research
and DMI design in general. Odom writes that the choice of
materials and level of ﬁnish ‘makes clear the commitment
of the artifact as a ﬁnished object’ [19].
This suggests a level of ‘ﬁnality’ to an instrument that
runs counter to performance contexts where the instrument
is widely understood to be constantly evolving, for exam-
ple where the DMI performer is also the designer, who re-
conﬁgures and adapts their instrument over a considerable
period of time without the goal of reaching a ‘ﬁnal version’
or even any notion of ‘improvement’. This can be seen in
contexts such as modular synth performances, where a func-
tionally complete instrument exists, but potentially only for
a single performance before being rearranged, simpliﬁed, or
updated. This raises a pertinent question for NIME re-
search about when an assemblage of technologies becomes
an instrument. We suggest that labelling an instrument a
‘research product’ need not set anything in stone in order
to achieve a level of ‘ﬁnish’: it is more a question of the
instrument being taken as a viable instrument in the here
and now of its performance context.
Independent: Research products are designed to be lived
with independently. This methodology is predicated on
the assumption that the designer is diﬀerent from the per-
former. In NIME we often ﬁnd situations where the de-
signer, composer and performer are the same person which
can give great insight into how these disciplines combine,
but can limit the reach of research conducted with the in-
strument to audiences the performer directly engages.
3. CASE STUDY : STRUMMI
To provide an example of theresearch product and technol-
ogy probe methodologies in practice within DMI research,
we present a case study of a series of guitar-like DMIs we
have calledStrummi. We designed seven diﬀerent variations
of Strummi over two generations. While the technology in-
side each variation remains broadly the same, the overall
material form and method of interaction with each version
was intended to address a number of diﬀerent inquiries.
The ﬁrst generation of Strummi instruments were pre-
sented in [8] and [11], focusing on the role of global form
vs. interaction modality, and richness of interaciton, respec-
tively. The early stages of a later research project involving
more recent variations of Strummi are detailed in [7].
3.1 Rationale for Design
Our goal with Strummi was to design a research artefact
capable of addressing thecultural form [9] of guitar-playing,
and how that might relate to new guitar-based DMIs. In
particular, we wanted to see how guitar-based Accessible
Figure 1: Left: construction of the bridge pieces for the

DMIs (ADMIs) might fulﬁl the social and cultural role of
guitars in an existing performance ecosystem. Accessible
Digital Musical Instruments (ADMIs) is a growing research
area (see [4]). A number of accessible guitar-based ADMIs
have been developed, including the Kellycaster1, Actuated
Guitar [12] and guitarMasheen [16].
In addition to guitar-based DMIs designed to address a
particular access need, there are a growing number of both
commercial- and research-based guitar-like DMIs, includ-
ing MIDI controllers such as Artiphon’sInstrument 1 2 and
Roger Linn Design’s Linnstrument3 provide a fretboard-
inspired note layout with MPE MIDI for individual note-
level expression for vibrato and slides.
We considered that components of the cultural form [9]
of guitar-playing - the choreography, the visual appeal and
aesthetics of guitars, the mimickry of role models in popu-
lar culture - were both signiﬁcant and under-explored in the
context of DMI research. The prototype instruments that
we created in the ﬁrst place were aimed at answering ques-
tions related to this cultural form, whether about the actual
morphology of the instrument itself, or about the degree of
control a performer has over that instrument.
3.2 Building Strummi
The principal idea behind the Strummi instruments is to
reproduce the physical action of strumming and plucking
a guitar, while simplifying the action of chord selection or
fretting to a push-button, similar to that of an Autoharp
or Omnichord. We developed two methods for strumming:
stringsand touch sensor . We also initially came up with two
diﬀerent form factors: guitar-like and tabletop (see Table 1)
.
3.2.1 Hardware
The strings version of Strummi feature six short lengths of
.40 gauge guitar string threaded through individual wooden
bridge pieces with integrated 15mm piezo disc sensors (see
Figure 1). This method maintains a tight mechanical con-
nection between the string and the piezo disc. A layer of
foam beneath each disc provides a degree of acoustic isola-
tion between adjacent strings.
The touch version uses a rectangular Trill capacitive touch
sensor 4 which is capable of detecting multiple touch posi-
tions along its length. In the software, we deﬁned six equally
spaced points along the length of the sensor where a note
would be triggered on receiving a touch input. To provide
tactile feedback, we applied several layers of paint to the
sensor where these note triggering points occur (see Figure
1). ‘Strumming’ and ‘plucking’ the touch sensor is anal-

ogous to swiping and tapping a touchscreen device. All
Strummis feature push-buttons to select chords. Pressing a
button results in each of the six virtual strings being tuned
to a preset chord voicing in the key of G Major.
Strummi uses a Bela Mini board 5, an open-source plat-
form for audio and sensor processing [15] which includes a
Pocket Beagle embedded Linux computer6 for processing
and ultra-low latency action-sound capabilities. The piezo
discs were attached to the analog inputs of Bela via a sim-
ple voltage biasing circuit. The analog inputs on Bela are
sampled at 22 kHz 16-bit allowing the signals to be treated
as audio signals throughout the DSP chain.
3.2.2 F orm F actors and Materials
For a more detailed description of the rationale behind the
various form factors of the ﬁrst generation of Strummis, see
[8]. To summarise, we wanted to compare the eﬀect of a
design which closely emulated both the aesthetic properties
and the playing style of a guitar, versus one which was more
comparable to tabletop music hardware.
From the outset, we intended to design research artefacts
which would be accepted by potential users as ‘ﬁnished’ in-
struments. Further to this, we were keen to ensure that
Strummi would maintain a sense of ‘cultural acceptability’
- in other words, that it wouldlook and feel like an instru-
ment that would plausibly be used in the cultural context
of strummed string performances, such as in a folk session.
These goals aﬀected our choices for materials and overall
aesthetic qualities, including the hardwood guitar-inspired
enclosure used in the ﬁrst generation of Strummi (see Table
1), and later the modiﬁed Les Paul guitar (Table 2).
3.2.3 Sound Design
The Strummi instruments use a basic implementation of
the Karplus-Strong plucked string algorithm to simulate the
harmonics and decay of an acoustic string. This synthesis
method is typically excited using a burst of noise to sim-
ulate the initial onset of a plucked string, however with
the Strummi instruments, we used two methods for excit-
ing the string model:sample triggering and audio-rate ex-
citation. For audio-rate excitation , we directly excite the
Karplus-Strong model with the audio signal from the piezo
disc. This technique of exciting string models with an audio
5http://bela.io
6http://beagleboard.org/pocket
signal has been used in instruments such as the Kalichord
Strum7, BladeAxe [17] and tangible virtual vibrating string
[3]. The eﬀect of this approach is a strikingly realistic simu-
lation of a full-length vibrating string: as the acoustic signal
from the piezo sensors is used to drive the Karplus-Strong
model, the nuances in the way that the dampened strings
are interacted with are preserved in the resulting sound.
3.3 Strummi in Research
To date the seven versions of the Strummi instruments have
been used in two major research projects. Throughout this
period we have revised the design and made minor mod-
iﬁcations which are detailed below. The evolution of our
designs were targeted at diﬀerent research goals, and with
this evolution has come a changed conceptualisation of the
instrument, from researchprobe to product.
3.3.1 Strummi as a T echnology Probe: Lab-based
Comparative Study
The initial study and its results are discussed in [8, 11]. In-
spired by the research probe methodologies as discussed in
2.1.1, we developed a set of instruments with the speciﬁc in-
tention of provoking reactions through its design in relation
to global form, input modality, and richness of interaction.
Our study methodology was a time-limited, lab-based and
highly structured experiment in which participants were di-
rected to complete short musical tasks on two Strummi in-
struments out of a possible four design variations. Each
performance section was followed by a questionnaire and
interview comparing the two instruments used. In this way,
we intentionally disrupted the participants’ conception of
what Strummi was by oﬀering a broadly similar, but signif-
icantly modiﬁed version to compare against.
What deﬁnes Strummi as a technology probe, rather than
prototype or research product, is that in this instance Strummi
serves as an explicit provocation to participants’ ingrained
notions of ‘guitar-likeness’. We were not looking to future
Strummis based on ﬁndings or feedback from the study par-
ticipants, nor were we deploying Strummis in the wild to
observe the human-instrument interaction over time.

The follow-up study saw three Strummi string instruments
deployed through a longitudinal and situated research part-
nership with a creative arts charity for people with learn-
ing disabilities (Heart n Soul 8). Over the course of a year,
we introduced the ﬁrst generation Strummis to a group
which took part in monthly jam sessions using electric gui-
tars, basses, drums and keyboards. The participants in this
group have a wide variety of access needs stemming from
physical impairments, learning disabilities and neurodiver-
gence. From our ﬁrst meeting, we observed that for some
members of this group, Strummi possessed accessibility af-
fordances due to the reduction of chord selection to a push-
button interface, whilst maintaining the responsiveness and
acoustic properties of the strumming interaction.
Our goal with this study was to observe the importance
of these potential accessibility aﬀordances over other fac-
tors such as the global form and aesthetics of Strummi, the
familiarity of other instruments, and the role of environ-
ment and social context in enabling access to music mak-
ing. Early reﬂections on this deployment are discussed in
[7]. This project concluded with two additional jam sessions
- called the‘Strummi sessions’ - which were audio and video
recorded, followed by a semi-structured group interview.
The early stages of this project highlighted usability is-
sues with the original Strummis. These included the weight
of the ‘guitar body’ enclosure, which made playing for long
periods uncomfortable, and inaccessible for many users with
mobility issues. We also noted that the push-buttons used
in the ﬁrst generation were prone to mechanical failure. Fi-
nally, the use of a 3.5mm headphone output meant that
Strummi could not easily be swapped with an electric gui-
tar when using a standard guitar jack lead.
Prior to the Strummi sessions, we designed a second gen-
eration of Strummis which addressed these issues (see Table
2) We redesigned the ‘guitar body’ Strummi to be lighter
and built with the same materials as the tabletop version,
modifying the shape to resemble a the classic Les Paul body.
We also went one step further towards ‘guitar-likeness’ by
modifying a Les Paul-style electric guitar with Strummi
hardware in the neck and body to create a further artefact.
The material changes to the second generation Strummis
did not aﬀect the functionality or sound of the instrument,
but were signiﬁcant from a research product standpoint. In
particular, the switch from the 3.5mm headphone input to a
6.35mm guitar jack made no impact on the sound of the in-
strument, but allowed it be swapped easily between the elec-
tric guitars already in use at the monthly jam sessions. Part
8www.heartnsoul.co.uk
of our inquiry was the question of whether guitar-based AD-
MIs could adopt the cultural form of electric guitar playing
in order to provide access to guitar performance for those
for whom unadapted electric guitars are inaccessible. Our
choices in form, materials, and connector types implied an
equivalence between Strummi and the electric guitars which
allowed us to observe people’s interaction with both instru-
ments on an equal footing - we didn’t have to ask the users
of Strummi to ‘imagine it being a ﬁnished instrument’ in
order to compare it with the guitar.
The key diﬀerence between this second study and the ﬁrst
is the move out of the lab and into a situated, longitudinal
and ethnographic approach. We were no longer concerned
with directing the participants of our study towards de-
ﬁned musical tasks, or otherwise compelling them to make
direct comparisons between the diﬀerent versions of the in-
strument. In other words, we were no longer ‘probing’ the
eﬀects of the diﬀerent versions of Strummi, but as much as
possible aimed to act as passive observers of interactions
with Strummi in an everyday setting.
It is worth noting that even without material changes, our
shift in research methodology was signiﬁcant in reframing
Strummi as a research product. This move from a lab-based
study to a situated ethnography-informed approach moved
us to consider ways in which the Strummi instruments could
help us answer broader questions of accessibility in guitar-
based ADMIs, as well as consider its independence and abil-
ity to be ‘lived with’ in a real world setting.
4. CONCLUSIONS
This paper serves as an introduction to research products
and partial exploration of how they ﬁt within NIME. We
have left many implications of DMIs as research products
unexplored and invite future researchers to contribute to
and develop this idea. A particular tension that warrants
further discussion is how ‘ﬁnished’ research products sit
alongside the explicitly unﬁnished and exploratory process
of participatory design - especially in relation to ADMIs.
The research product approach is of potential beneﬁt to
DMI researchers interested in observing the relationships
between instruments, their players, their audience and their
environments. Part of its value comes from recognising
that prototypes, although essential when crafting musical
interactions, are necessarily limited in their research scope.
There is an opportunity for more NIME work to ﬁt into
the research product category, allowing the consideration
of interactions with new instruments based on what they
are rather than what they might become. The notion of

‘ﬁnishing’ a new instrument however runs up against cer-
tain community values in NIME which both push towards
a prototype approach. What exactlyﬁnish might mean in
relation to NIME does not entirely equate to a sense of ma-
terial ‘completeness’ but rather highlights how instruments
can be considered as realised through their performance. A
research product here may be better framed as a product
of a speciﬁc and evolving music ecology. Finish could be
considered as both an attitude towards an instrument be-
ing functionally complete within a performance context, as
well as the material and aesthetic qualities that lend the
instrument its ecological validity.
NIME’s tendency to focus on speciﬁc technological con-
tributions such as technical novelty and new uses of sensors
as the locus of contribution stands as a barrier: aspects such
as the material ﬁnish of an artefact do not have a position in
this kind of research. This was previously discussed in the
NIMEHub workshop [14] as a limitation of sharing design
knowledge through technical papers. Research products ar-
gue for taking aspects of a design such as materiality and
ﬁnish as seriously as technological aspects.
These points also apply to the question of evaluation in
NIME. The nature of our evaluation methods has long been
a concern for NIME researchers [1]. A move towards re-
search products in NIME would mean considering instru-
ments more as situated, ecologically valid artefacts. Impor-
tantly the research product methodology is inclusive of the
method of deployment and evaluation as well as the design
of the instrument. Research products recast ‘evaluation’ as
a qualitative and reﬂective process focusing on sociocultural
phenomena, rather than quasi-scientiﬁc methods based on
ﬁrst-wave HCI techniques. Research products oﬀer a com-
plimentary methodology that can help access the nature of
interactive technologies in everyday life.
