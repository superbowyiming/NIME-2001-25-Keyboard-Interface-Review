International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Documentation and Replicability in the NIME Community

ABSTRACT
In this paper, we discuss the importance of replicability in Digital Musical Instrument 
(DMI) design and the NIME community. Replication enables us to: create new artifacts 
based on existing ones, experiment DMIs in different contexts and cultures, and 
validate obtained results from evaluations. We investigate how the papers present 
artifact documentation and source code by analyzing the NIME proceedings from 
2018, 2019, and 2020. We argue that the presence and the quality of documentation 
are good indicators of replicability and can be beneficial for the NIME community. 
Finally, we discuss the importance of documentation for replication, propose a call to 
action towards more replicable projects, and present a practical guide informing 
future steps toward replicability in the NIME community.

Introduction
Replication is a fundamental aspect of scientific and technological research, enabling 
peers to validate or possibly challenge existing results [1]. Replication is also essential 
in learning since replicating existing works allows us to understand complex 
developments' intricacies fully. While research domains may strongly value novelty, 
replication can be fundamental as in the case of artistic practice, for instance, for craft 
development.
Our principal question for the NIME community is whether supporting replicability is 
in opposition to our collective interest in novelty and idiosyncrasy (the conference is 
named "new" interfaces for musical expression). Our community’s quest for novelty 
can be viewed as a gradual breadth-first search through a vast design space for Digital 
Musical Instruments (DMIs). Improving the documentation and replicability of our 
musical artifacts should help us avoid "reinventing the wheel" and instead focus our 
efforts on either a) under-explored regions of this design space or b) tweaking designs

that have been deemed interesting or "successful". Perhaps parts of the community are 
interested in instrument aesthetics that are dependent on uniqueness and mystery—of 
course, this also is fine. Still, it might be better for us to document and discuss this 
preference explicitly (see, e.g., the CC No-derivative works license) rather than 
depending on obscurity.
Assuming that some significant portion of the NIME community is interested in a 
collective exploration of the digital musical instrument (DMI) design space, what do we 
gain from trying to make our work truly replicable? The benefits can be explored from 
several perspectives, some of which are outlined below.
Expanding composition and performance
With replication, instruments become available for users in different locations and 
cultures and future generations, enabling more performers, composers, and audiences 
to experience artifacts or systems. Multiple copies of an instrument can support 
composition workshops, and concerts focused on a particular DMI. Audiences lack 
context for understanding new instruments, and historically composition and 
performance practices have emerged from collective creation and 
experience/evaluation over years or centuries. The generation of new contexts in 
which new instruments and interfaces can be interpreted, understood, and enjoyed can 
be fostered through such workshops and concerts, as well as through ensemble 
performances in which more than one instance of a new instrument are played 
together [2].
Evaluation
Some (though certainly not all) NIME publications make claims regarding their new 
creations, in many cases explicitly acknowledging that these claims need more data to 
be more than anecdotal. Well-documented NIMEs—coupled with a culture of 
replication in our community—could strengthen existing empirical results and help us 
learn from our failures. Observations of NIMEs are often experiential and subjective 
rather than objective through measurements of speed or efficiency, and replication can 
also help. A description or a video of an instrument cannot replace the understanding 
one gains by holding and interacting with the instrument. Without the ability to 
recreate and interact personally with the artifact or system, others can not form an 
opinion of its playability or other subjective and context-dependent attributes.

Growth, remix and avoiding obsolescence
Replicability strongly impacts the difference between a “living” instrument and an 
archived one. Unfortunately, the NIME conference's history is littered with once-
interesting but now-unplayable interfaces, artifacts, and systems—unplayable due to 
age, breakage, obsolete software, missing drivers, and any number of other legitimate 
reasons [3]. Good documentation may allow “porting” the instrument to newer 
hardware and software platforms in the future. Even more importantly, it enables 
evolution, inspiration, extrapolation, and remixing of existing designs, keeping the 
design alive, so it doesn’t need to be resurrected except as a historical curiosity.
Replication beyond NIME, in other areas
In this paper, we focus on the replicability of artifacts, one among seven research 
contribution types categorized in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) [4]. 
The NIME conference started in 2001 as a workshop for the leading venue in HCI: the 
CHI conference. Members of the CHI community organized the RepliCHI panel [1], 
leading to a series of workshops [5],[6], and Special Interest Group (SIG) towards a 
new submission venue for replication [7]. The organizers of the RepliCHI panel stated 
that their community and therefore themselves “do not value, facilitate, or reward 
replication in research, and often take the significant results of a single user study on 
20 users to be true" [7]. Replication of research results is not rewarded, while 
researchers are pushed to capitalize on novelty in their research. Artifacts from the 
NIME community may feature hardware or software components. Perkel discusses 
challenges faced by scientists who dare themselves to revive and run their own 
decades-old code, including replacing extinct hardware and dead language [8].
Replication in past NIME editions
Replicating a DMI can be a complex endeavor. It may involve both device replication 
and the information on sound synthesis and mapping choices with the original context 
that needs to be available.
Three examples illustrate how complex DMI replication can be.
In the early 2000s, the last author has tried to acquire a copy of Michel Waisvisz’s the 
Hands. Though a version of the Hands had been produced in the ’90s, called the Midi 
Conductor [9], none were available at that time. After discussing with Waisvisz on 
several occasions, some possible avenues for creating a Hands version were mentioned 
but unfortunately not pursued. Despite the immense impact of this device in the 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Documentation and Replicability in the NIME Community
5
computer music and NIME communities and the availability of several videos 
documenting Waisvisz’s performances, to this date, creating a faithful version of the 
Hands is not straightforward.
A second example relates to Serge de Laubier’s Méta-instrument, another important 
NIME with a long and varied history of use [10]. After purchasing a copy of the 2nd 
version of the Méta-instrument in the mid-2000s, we wanted to perform some of its 
existing repertoires. Even with the device at hand, it proved difficult to obtain detailed 
information on the synthesis methods used in existing pieces.
A third example involves the Buchla Lightning, perhaps one of the most widespread 
and impactful commercial NIMEs, including an embedded sound synthesizer card. We 
purchased a version of the Lightning II around 2002 and tried to perform examples of 
performances by Lightning virtuoso Mark Goldstein, most notably his soundtrack for 
Murnau’s 1926 Faust silent film. We had access to Goldstein’s score (notation of 
gestures and patches used throughout the movie) and a video of his guest performance 
during NIME03’s opening concert. The issue here was that the version of the 
Lightning we purchased had a different sound card and, therefore, not the same 
patches as those in Goldstein’s device, making it complicated to use it in that context.
In NIME literature, the amount of papers specifically proposing the replication of 
NIMEs originally developed by other designers is minimal. The analysis of NIME 
proceedings revealed only two papers matching this proposition: 1) Rebuilding and 
Reinterpreting a Digital Musical Instrument - The Sponge [11], and 2) Learning from 
History: Recreating and Repurposing Harriet Padberg’s Computer Composed Canon 
and Free Fugue [12].
Rebuilding and Reinterpreting the Sponge
Tom et al. rebuilt and reinterpreted the Sponge, a DMI initially developed by Martin 
Marier. The original DMI was first presented by Marier at the NIME conference in 
2010 [13] and was described as a DMI built to detect squeeze, flexion, torsion, and 
button action to form an interface to generate and sculpt sounds.
Even if the original Sponge paper did not present complete building instructions, 
Marier still maintains a website with all the building process documented, software 
used, and a bill of materials containing all necessary hardware, including cost (in 
Canadian dollars) [14].

Tom reported that even though the instructions provided at Marier’s website to 
reproduce the Sponge were thorough, he contacted the original author to answer some 
questions that arise during the replication process.
The replication experience gave Tom et al. the opportunity to review the building 
process and the physical instrument. The paper authors then reinterpreted the Sponge 
by replacing sensors, embedding synthesis processes, and adding vibrotactile 
feedback. Since the final instrument deferred too much from the original Sponge, the 
authors decided to rename the DMI to FlexSynth. Surprisingly, the FlexSynth [15] does 
not contain all necessary documentation to replicate the new DMI. While one can 
currently find in the repository software code, including FlexSynth firmware, there are 
no building instructions, bill of materials, or other information on using the available 
Max/MSP patches.
Harriet Padberg’s Computer Composed Canon and Free Fugue
Savery et al. proposed a modern recreation and utilization of the Computer-Composed 
Canon and Free Fugue algorithm, originally composed and programmed by Harriet 
Padberg [12]. The original software was programmed in FORTRAN and can be 
described as a program to map text (individual letters) to pitch, rhythm, and musical 
phrasing. Savery et al. recreated the algorithm from Padberg’s thesis: PyPadberg [16]. 
PyPadberg was used in a music piece entitled Not Even One, composed by Molly Jones, 
an audio-visual piece—Brevity— composed by Anna Savery, and to create a novel 
mapping for the keyboard—the Padberg Piano—proposed by Anthony Caulkins.
Caulkins’ proposition can also be seen as a DMI built using Padberg’s algorithm. The 
paper authors describe Padberg Piano as a software instrument available as an audio 
plugin, allowing other composers to use the standard piano notation for the performer, 
but transposing the resulting pitches in a 24-key per octave microtonal mapping.
Even though PyPadberg is open-source, Padberg Piano does not contain a public 
repository. Like FlexSynth, an initiative to replicate and reinterpret other DMIs does 
not provide enough information to replicate the new instrument directly from the 
documentation.
Documentation Review
Documentation is an essential step towards replicability. In the context of this paper, 
documentation is the set of texts, images, photos, illustrations, diagrams, videos, 
source code, models, and any other media that describe or represent a certain artifact, 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Documentation and Replicability in the NIME Community

covering how it is, how it works, how users can use it, and how it can be built. Without 
a well-documented project, replication becomes an arduous task.
To understand the current state of NIME projects’ documentation, we reviewed 306 
papers in the published proceedings from 2018, 2019, and 2020 editions of the NIME 
conference. We focus on documentation because we consider it is an observable 
portion of the replication process.
Research questions
Our research questions for this review are:
Data source
This review data source is the papers published in the NIME proceedings in 2018, 
2019, and 2020. Table 1 presents the number of papers per year in the NIME 
conference.
We chose the last three editions of the conference to cover the most recent projects. 
Our strategy with this first run of the review is to understand the details that may be 
automated and, in the future, expand the number of editions of the conference 
proceedings.

Search strategy
Regarding RQ1, we performed an automatic extraction of URLs of the 306 PDF files. 
We considered that links to the project’s website and/or repositories are the more 
direct way for the paper’s authors to share additional information about the project. 
Image 1 presents the regular expression used to automatically extract the URL from 
the papers.
Regarding RQ2, we consider that the documentation of a project is not only descriptive 
files but also the available source files.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We focus our review on technological propositions of papers that presented the 
development of an artifact (new or replicated) for musical use. In the context of this 
review, we considered that an artifact is an object that was created, be it software or 
hardware, acoustic or digital. And the concept of "musical use" covers general areas 
such as musical performance, installations, sound-related applications.
As exclusion criteria, we defined that papers that do not clearly state the development 
of an artifact would not be included in our review. To illustrate, some examples of 
excluded papers would be the ones whose only present general discussions, 
methodologies, conceptual frameworks, user studies, evaluation of existing artifacts, 
and surveys.
Refinement Protocol
The steps for refining the pool of reviewed papers follow the questions presented in 
Image 2.

First, our team analyzed the title and the abstract of the 306 papers to find pieces of 
evidence of the development of artifacts for musical use to match the previously 
defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
In the second step, a list of URLs was automatically extracted from the PDF files of the 
included papers. The code used for URL extraction can be found in this repository. The 
review team tested and visited each URL to validate if the links actually related to the 
presented project or were just reference to other projects. Then, we selected the URLs 
of the project’s website or repository for further analysis.
In Step 3, we considered papers with either website or repository. Then, we analyzed 
the project’s available materials (paper’s content, project’s website, and/or repository)

to check the existence of different documentation file types based on a checklist 
inspired by [17], which we present as follows:
To consider documentation items that were possibly not covered by this list, we 
allowed the reviewer to add items during the review. The emergent documentation 
items are:

In Image 3, we show the number of papers selected for each step. From the original 
306 papers, after initial exclusion based on title and abstract analysis and excluding

paper after full paper reading, the resulting pool was composed of 242 papers (this 
amounts to an approximate 21% exclusion rate). Finally, out of 242 papers, 67% (163) 
linked neither project website nor repositories, resulting in 79 papers eligible for 
analysis of documentation items and file types (see Image 4).
As a guideline for comparison, we assume that the high diversity of documentation 
items is advantageous for a specific project. Our review did consider the number of 
specific items, we only checked the presence or absence of an item. We believe that 
the diversity of materials illuminates different aspects of the project and can facilitate 
the understanding of people interested in replicating the artifact.
Results
In this section, we focus on the results regarding the analysis of 79 selected projects. 
All the projects presented the minimum of documentation, but 4 (5%) out of 79 had 
only textual description with no photos, images, video, or other documentation items. 
We found that 25 (32%) of the projects did not present any source file.

Concerning the project components, 32 (40%) projects had hardware and software, 
and 47 (60%) projects had only software. No project in the selected group reported 
only hardware components. As can be seen in Image 5, code is the most frequent 
documentation item present in 54 (68%) projects. From the 32 projects that reported 
both hardware and software components, 14 (43% of 32) of them had only code, and 
12 (37.5% of 32) no source file.
Image 6 shows the distribution of projects segmented by the number of diverse file 
types. One project (1%) out of 79 presented 10 different documentation items. This 
particular project did not have Build Instructions or Run/Use Instructions and also no 
Media files. The most numerous group, with 27 (34%) projects, presented 4 different 
documentation file types.

About licenses (Image 7), 56 (71%) of the 79 projects did not mention any license on 
their website or repository. On the other hand, the most commonly used license was 
GPL-3.0 with 9 projects (40% of the 23 projects that mentioned a license).

Analysis
We found that two-thirds (163) of the papers that reported an artifact for musical use 
did not present further details about the artifact other than the paper. Additionally, 
only 14 (6%), out of 242 projects, showed more than six documentation items, which 
raises the question about how the projects are being documented. We could interpret 
that a project with a more diverse number of documentation items could present more 
details and, therefore, documentation with higher chances of being well understood. In 
other words, projects with more documentation items could communicate better, 
positively impacting its replicability.
The license is an important aspect of project sharing [18]. It is a permission 
communication tool whose intention is to have the project or part of it being used by 
others. That is why it is essential to analyze the presence of licenses in the project’s 
documentation in this review.
When 67% of the papers do not have additional information about the discussed 
artifact, 70% of the projects do not mention any license, and only 6% of the included 
papers have more than six documentation items, we could interpret that there is, in 
the majority of the papers, little intention for sharing the projects.

Discussion and Call to Action
There is a relatively small number of NIME papers whose documentation fulfills the 
guidelines proposed in the previous section or presents replicability as part of the main 
contribution. Several actions can be taken to improve and stimulate reproducibility 
and replicability in the NIME community.
There have been some efforts in this direction, including the workshop NIMEHub: 
Toward a Repository for Sharing and Archiving Instrument Designs, held at the 2016 
NIME conference in Brisbane, Australia [19]. This half-day workshop promoted 
discussion towards the creation of a repository to share DMI design documentations. 
The discussion of such a repository appears to have been interrupted after the 
workshop, but we hope that this work can promote dialog on the subject.
NIME community is transdisciplinary, including researchers from different areas, 
artists, and entrepreneurs that may not wish to have their designs replicated. Our goal 
should not—and is not—make all DMI designs in the NIME community replicable. 
Nevertheless, we believe that those who intend to open their projects for replication 
should be encouraged, supported, and have proper guidelines to document 
instruments.
The creation of a repository for sharing DMIs can be one step toward creating a 
culture of replicability and replication. However, the utility of such a repository is 
linked to the community’s interest and effort in maintaining documentation of their 
own projects and its desire to replicate other instruments. What can be done to 
catalyze this cultural shift? The following sections present some initial thoughts and 
possible approaches to foment replicability.
Improving DMI Documentation for Replicability
A well-documented process of designing and building DMIs may solve some of the 
problems found in the previous section. Thorough documentation can include detailed 
textual descriptions and instructions, images, videos, diagrams, source files, and other 
relevant media. In the same way, we expect to have access to papers published 
decades ago, so we should be able to access the information required to replicate a 
particular DMI.
Guidelines for Replication-driven Documentation
As a result of spending a long time designing a particular DMI, instrument designers 
know how to build their instruments in detail. It is hard to predict what other 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Documentation and Replicability in the NIME Community
17
researchers/designers will need to replicate a DMI successfully. The documentation 
process is cumbersome, and guidelines on what is necessary to ensure minimal 
replicability can help.
Inspired by the Open Source DMIs certification proposal [17] based on the Open 
Source Hardware Association, and by salient points from our review of the NIME 
conference, we developed a checklist that can be seen in Table 2.
Structured checklist of General, Hardware, and Software documentation of DMIs for 
replication. The marked cells represent which documentation features related to the 
development phases of a DMI.

This structured checklist considers some possible aspects to include in DMI 
documentation. According to the components used in the DMI design, specific columns 
present the expected documentation to ensure the instrument replicability. As 
discussed in the NIMEhub workshop, standardization of hardware platforms can ease 
the process of documenting hardware [19].
However, the documentation needed for replication or reinterpretation of a DMI is not 
a matter of simply satisfying a checklist. It is a subjective process that is only verified 
when someone else manages to replicate the instrument. Moreover, a successful 
replication depends not only on the documentation but also on the technical abilities of 
the replicator, their access to tools and materials, amongst other factors. 
Documentation for replicability is a dialogic process that should always account for 
who it is intended for; the more detailed the documentation, the more inclusive it 
becomes.
Documentation is not always necessary for replication or creating new DMIs inspired 
by them, and most of the time direct access for the designer can replace a well-
documented repository. However, the importance of repositories and an open database 
lies in the democratization of information, allowing a broader and more diverse set of 
potential replicators. We also believe that there’s always room for improvement in any 
documentation, and discussion forums may provide the grounds for continuous 
growing documentation based on concrete feedback from researchers, instrument 
designers, and replicators.
Distributed or Centralized Repositories?
There are many ways repositories can be organized and indexed. It is important to 
discuss the trade-offs between distributed and centralized architectures to ensure 
access to documentation.
Centralized repositories such as the one used for archiving the NIME conference 
proceedings (Zenodo [20]) and many other Open Science repositories have many 
advantages in terms of how trustworthy they are to keep scientific data accessible over 
Dependencies x x x x

time. Private or institutional websites can change the URLs of cited pages or can be 
deleted from servers.
This ruggedness, nevertheless, may come at a cost for the community. Hosting data in 
the form of videos, images, and source code comes with financial costs, and different 
platforms offer advantages and drawbacks that need to be openly discussed. 
Maintaining a central repository also demands large amounts of voluntary work, and a 
long-lasting commitment is also necessary for such a decision.
A distributed solution, on the other hand, can use already existing open repositories 
for videos (e.g. Vimeo, Youtube), source files (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge), audio 
files (e.g. Soundcloud, Freesound), and other platforms [19]. Designers can be 
responsible for maintaining their own data in these repositories. The papers would 
reference these data on a new specific simplified meta-data centralized repository.
One noticeable advantage in sharing documentation in distributed Git repositories is 
the freedom to continuously update the documentation in a collaborative environment, 
where developers and potential replicators can trace each version, share issues, and 
contribute to the development of the documentation and the design. The git workflows 
through forks, branches and pull requests can help the documentation process.
Conversely, one problem with the decentralized approach is the uncertainty that this 
data will remain available over time. The scientific time scale is very different from 
what some of these platforms were designed for. How long will a video be available for 
free on YouTube? The future of such a platform is uncertain, and the unavailability of 
one repository can compromise DMI replicability.
We hope and expect that this discussion will expand beyond this paper and gather 
responses from the NIME community. Perhaps community feedback will lead to a 
mixed approach, in which distributed repositories can be continuously updated by the 
designers/researchers, along with a centralized peer-reviewed process with meta-data 
and crystallized release versions or forks of the distributed documentation. Any 
approach to protecting documentation depends on the level of commitment of the 
community to embrace and maintain such a system.
Other Actions to Stimulate Replication
Creating documentation for replicable DMIs is a process that demands considerable 
work that is not necessarily related to the primary research contribution. This section 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Documentation and Replicability in the NIME Community
20
presents suggestions to encourage researchers and designers to engage in such efforts 
to create replicable DMI documentation.
New NIME publication format: A Replicable DMI Design Documentation
Publishing a paper in the NIME Conference proceedings presents a motivation for 
researchers to present their work and contribute to science, technology, and arts. A 
specific call for replicable (or replicated) DMIs could foster papers focused on 
replicate, recreate, rebuild, and reinterpret DMIs.
Further discussion is needed about the specifics of such special calls, but we could 
inherit many of our current practices of peer-reviewing, creating referenceable DOIs 
within an Open Science repository, and having them presented at the conferences. This 
publication type should probably also have some new features, going beyond the PDF 
format and allowing for the many media we listed above.
The NIME community already has opened on the 2019 NIME Conference the Music 
Proceedings recognizing the importance of artistic contributions as much as the 
scientific papers. Having a technical report as a new publication format would 
recognize rigorous design and engineering efforts without necessarily requiring 
associated scientific contributions. In our view, this would be a good step forward for 
our interdisciplinary community.
Certification and Badges
Another action that could stimulate replicability would be an official certification 
process for replicable DMIs such as that proposed by Calegario et al. [17]. A 
committee would evaluate proposed documentation and grant certification to those 
that match some prerequisites. That is currently done by the Open Source Hardware 
Association (OSHWA)[21].
A similar approach that would demand a smaller effort but could also have some 
positive impact would be to include in the submission process an optional badge to 
affirm that a paper is “Replication Friendly” and thus invites replication by others. A 
simple action that could stimulate people in engaging in better documentation for 
replicability.
Replication Challenge
An approach that could be considered is to propose a “NIME Replication Challenge”. 
In this challenge, we could reward people that replicates a previously documented 
International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression Documentation and Replicability in the NIME Community
21
DMI from the conference. This simple approach can help to create a culture of 
replicability not only focused on “novelties” but also engaging in each other’s work.
Replication Officers
We did not intend with this “call to action” to give any answers on what is the best 
thing the NIME community should do but to begin a discussion on how our community 
can improve towards replicability. Discussion of other topics such as diversity, 
inclusion, and environmental sustainability at past conferences has led to the creation 
of new officers in the NIME Steering Committee. We propose that “Replication 
Officers” could be created to serve as focal points for discussing and implementing 
such actions.
Limitations
The method used in the documentation review presents a set of limitations. Biases 
have possibly been introduced since the analyzed material was divided equally with six 
reviewers. Even though we discussed the criteria in consensus meetings, assuring that 
the review team had the most approximate understanding, the individual judgment 
might have differed during the review. To attenuate the impact of subjective 
interpretation, one of the reviewers also acted as a meta-reviewer, supervising the 
process and attempting to identify the proposed method’s divergent interpretation.
The second limitation concerns the review’s time window, which covered three years of 
the NIME conference. In future iterations, we plan to automatize some of the steps to 
increase productivity and enlarge the temporal scope.
The third limitation is related to the checklist we used to review the papers since it 
may not be complete leaving room for blind spots. To mitigate this, we chose to let the 
reviewer input documentation items that were not previously defined. However, this 
action is susceptible to bias since it is dependent on each reviewer’s attention and 
memory.
Conclusion
In this paper, we highlighted the importance of replication in the NIME community and 
its impact on the use, evaluation, understanding, and creations of digital musical 
instruments and other artifacts for musical expression. We discuss the concept of 
replication in other areas beyond NIME. Additionally, we revisited some experiences in 
Computer Music’s and NIME’s literature that report the replication of previously 
created instruments. Then, since documentation is a critical factor for allowing

replication, we reviewed 306 papers from 2018, 2019, and 2020 of the NIME 
conference proceedings to investigate the projects’ documentation covering 
descriptive and source files. The result shows that the majority of papers has few or no 
documentation items and files other than the paper’s content. Finally, we call attention 
to the NIME community to replication-driven documentation and we propose some 
ideas to stimulate the community towards a replication-friendly environment.
