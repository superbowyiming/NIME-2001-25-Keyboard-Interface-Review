Abstract
This paper introduces the Harmonix series, a collection of Acces-
sible Digital Musical Instruments (ADMIs) designed to enhance
mood stability and mindfulness through intuitive and interactive
music-making. Recognising the barriers posed by traditional dig-
ital musical instruments, including steep learning curves, high
costs, and uninspiring outputs, Harmonix prioritises affordability,
portability, and user-friendly interfaces to cater to individuals
with no prior musical training.
The study evaluates two instruments, ZenithChimes and Equi-
librio. ZenithChimes employs touch-sensitive keys mapped to
meditative tones in the Aeolian mode, promoting creativity and
relaxation. Equilibrio, a 3D-printed "stone stack, " uses tilt ges-
tures to modulate soundscapes, symbolising balance and har-
mony. Both instruments integrate calming auditory outputs and
minimalist design aesthetics to create an engaging and meditative
experience.
A workshop-based study with 10 participants, spanning di-
verse backgrounds, demonstrated the instruments’ accessibility
and therapeutic potential. Results showed that participants found
the instruments easy to use, aesthetically appealing, and suitable
for mindfulness practices, with 70 percent identifying their inte-
gration into meditation or yoga sessions as beneficial. However,
feedback highlighted the need for more customisation options,
particularly in Equilibrio’s soundscapes.
By bridging art, technology, and mindfulness, Harmonix fos-
ters creative exploration and emotional regulation, with impli-
cations for therapeutic, educational, and artistic applications.
Future work will explore sustainability, inclusivity, and multi-
sensory feedback to enhance the instruments’ design and impact.
This study underscores the potential of ADMIs to transcend con-
ventional music-making, offering innovative tools for well-being
and self-expression.

making[13]. These issues highlight the need for effective and
accessible interventions that support mental well-being.
Music therapy and meditation have emerged as non-pharmaceutical
strategies for fostering relaxation, resilience, and self-expression.
Music-making engages neural plasticity and offers a means of
creative exploration, while meditation encourages focus and self-
awareness. [3] When combined, their benefits are often amplified,
offering valuable tools for holistic well-being[9, 15].
Despite this potential, the integration of music technologies
into meditative or therapeutic contexts remains limited. Many
practitioners lack formal training in digital tools[4], and existing
systems are frequently expensive, unintuitive, or impractical
for therapeutic use[6, 9]. Moreover, the sonic output of many
digital musical instruments (DMIs) is often perceived as artificial
or lacking emotional resonance, diminishing their relevance in
mindfulness settings[14].
This paper addresses five key limitations in current DMI de-
sign:
(1) Barriers to entry for novice users,
(2) High costs and poor portability,
(3) Unintuitive interfaces,
(4) Unengaging sound output,
(5) Limited integration with meditative practice.
We introduce the Harmonix series, a collection of Accessi-
ble Digital Musical Instruments (ADMIs) that support creativity,
emotional expression, and mindfulness. Harmonix, blending ’har-
mony’ and ’remix’ to represent our vision of individuals living
in harmony (with self and others) while creatively remixing ex-
periences through music. Through the use of contemporary fab-
rication techniques and embodied interaction, Harmonix seeks
to bridge the gap between music technology, accessibility, and
therapeutic engagement.
2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Sound and Group Meditation
Sound plays a vital role in enhancing group meditation by foster-
ing collective mindfulness and deepening the meditative experi-
ence. Tibetan singing bowl meditation has been shown to reduce
anxiety and depression while increasing spiritual well-being, es-
pecially for individuals without prior meditation experience. Its
simplicity and low cost make it widely accessible.
Music also enhances guided meditation through rhythmic
qualities that synchronise with breath and bodily movement, pro-
moting a more immersive meditative state[2]. Research suggests
that ambient or non-melodic music is preferred by beginners, as
it aids focus and breath awareness[10, 14]. Many novice medita-
tors report that music makes meditation more approachable and
NIME ’25, June 24–27, 2025, Canberra, Australia Wing Hei Cheryl Hui and Patrick Hartono
increases their motivation to continue the practice. These find-
ings support the integration of music into mindfulness training,
particularly for new practitioners.
2.2 Music and Meditation in Therapeutic
Practices
The integration of music and mindfulness has been shown to
support emotional regulation, reduce stress, and improve psy-
chological well-being. For instance, mindfulness-based music
therapy has demonstrated greater effectiveness than mindful-
ness alone in improving mood and emotional regulation in older
women with blindness[15].These findings highlight the value of
combining music and meditation in holistic therapeutic contexts,
particularly for enhancing mental and emotional health.
Meditation as Therapy
Meditation promotes stress reduction, self-awareness, and emo-
tional resilience. By encouraging a shift from self-deception to
self-understanding, it plays a key role in interventions for anxi-
ety, depression, and chronic stress[3].
Music as Therapy
Music therapy activates multiple brain regions, enhancing cog-
nitive flexibility and emotional processing[4]. Research shows
that music increases dopamine and reduces cortisol levels, aid-
ing mood regulation and stress relief[4]. These effects position
music as a powerful tool in therapeutic and mindfulness contexts.
The Synergy of Music and Meditation
When combined, music and meditation create a synergistic effect
that enhances the therapeutic impact of both practices. Music
can serve as a guide during meditation, with rhythmic qualities
synchronizing with breathing or body movements to deepen the
meditative state. Ambient soundscapes or harmonic progressions
can draw attention inward, reducing external distractions and
supporting mindfulness. Studies have shown that the integra-
tion of music into meditation practices can amplify relaxation,
promote emotional healing, and improve cognitive function [9].
Emerging technologies, particularly Digital Musical Instru-
ments (DMIs) designed for mindfulness, represent a novel ap-
proach to this synergy. By enabling users to create immersive
soundscapes and engage in intuitive interactions, DMIs foster ac-
tive participation in music and meditation simultaneously. These
instruments offer a platform for personal exploration and self-
expression, enriching the meditative experience while encourag-
ing creativity and introspection.
2.3 Digital Musical Instruments in
Mindfulness Practices
Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) have begun to explore mind-
fulness and meditative applications, aiming to bridge traditional
contemplative practices with modern technology. However, de-
spite innovations like the Zen Meditation Instrument[5], the Zen
Flute[12], and the Mixed Reality Handpan Interface[7], such tools
are rarely adopted in real-world mindfulness settings such as
yoga studios or therapeutic environments. A major barrier lies
in their reliance on screen-based or VR interfaces, which lack the
tactile, resonant qualities of traditional instruments like singing
bowls. While apps offer convenience, they often sacrifice physical
feedback, and immersive systems demand specialised hardware,
limiting accessibility. This disconnect reveals a gap between the
design of DMIs and the embodied, sensory nature of established
meditative practices.
2.4 Accessibility in Digital Musical
Instruments
Efforts to develop Accessible Digital Musical Instruments (AD-
MIs) have led to promising innovations. For example, Cymis uses
pre-programmed scores to enable music-making for individu-
als with severe disabilities, though it emphasises functionality
over creative and social engagement[1]. The Quintet supports
group participation with built-in songs but may limit creative
expression due to its fixed repertoire and conventional interface.
The Strummi, designed for trained disabled musicians, offers
performance-focused interaction but requires fine motor con-
trol, limiting accessibility for beginners or users with significant
physical impairments[8]. These examples highlight the need for
ADMIs that are not only functional but also tactile, expressive,
and socially integrative—particularly in contexts like mindful-
ness, where embodied interaction and emotional connection are
essential.
The Harmonix series aims to address these limitations by
offering tactile, expressive, and socially integrative interfaces
that support both individual and group engagement. Designed
for users with no prior music training, it minimises technological
barriers while bridging the gap between digital instrument design,
accessibility, and mindfulness practices.
3 DESIGN METHODOLOGY
This section details the design and implementation of the two
instruments in the Harmonix series, ZenithChimes and Equilibrio,
focusing on their physical interfaces and corresponding audio
mapping.
3.1 ZenithChimes
3.1.1 Interface Design. ZenithChimes is an Accessible Digital
Musical Instrument (ADMI) designed for low-threshold music-
making through touch. Its form draws inspiration from the calm-
ing resonance of wind chimes found in Japanese temples, with
a minimalist design featuring seven keys in black and white,
echoing the visual language of piano keys.
Interaction is enabled via copper tape embedded with capac-
itive sensors on each key (Figure 1), allowing users to trigger
sounds through gentle contact. An ESP32 microcontroller man-
ages sensor input and communicates via OSC with MAX/MSP,
functioning as a MIDI controller. The instrument’s sculptural
form allows it to serve as both a sound-making device and a
displayable art object.
3.1.2 Audio Design. Key-to-Tone Mapping. Each of the seven
keys is mapped to pitches from the Raga Darbari Kanada (Aeolian
mode), known for its therapeutic potential in alleviating anxiety
and insomnia[11]. These pitches range from Eb3 to Bb6, ensuring
both clarity across speaker systems and accessibility for a wide
age range.
To support continuous and harmonically stable music-making,
Keys 1 and 3 are both assigned to Bb (the dominant of Eb Major),
while Keys 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 randomly trigger one of two possible
notes to encourage variation.
Tonal Characteristics. Each triggered tone produces a soft,
bell-like sound followed by a short resonance, emulating a sound
bath environment.

Output Details. All synthesis is handled in MAX/MSP, with
MIDI data transmitted via OSC for low-latency performance.
3.2 Equilibrio
3.2.1 Interface Design. Equilibrio is a fully 3D-printed ADMI
that integrates principles of sculptural minimalism and medita-
tive interaction. Inspired by the visual and symbolic language
of stone stacking, it invites users to explore balance through
embodied movement.
Interaction is facilitated by passive changes in conductivity
detected by capacitive sensors embedded within the structure.
As the user tilts the “stone stack, ” these signals are interpreted
by an ESP32 microcontroller and transmitted to MAX/MSP via
OSC. All electronics are hidden within the object, allowing it to
function as both an interactive instrument and a contemplative
art piece (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Equilibrio sound sculpture
3.2.2 Audio Design. Equilibrio maps physical tilting to two si-
multaneous audio controls: panning and modulation.
Horizontal Tilt Mapping. The instrument’s horizontal tilt
modulates the stereo position of the sound—left tilt moves audio
to the left channel, right tilt to the right, and a centred position
keeps the audio balanced. Simultaneously, tilt also controls play-
back speed of an ambient soundtrack (between 0.8x and 1.0x),
producing shifts in texture and introducing harmonic dissonance
as tilt increases. This dual mapping metaphorically represents
states of equilibrium and imbalance.
Sound Design. The ambient base layer includes field record-
ings of rainfall and rivers, alongside synthesised tones modelled
on Tibetan singing bowls. These elements were selected to sup-
port relaxation and introspection, aligning with research suggest-
ing their effectiveness in meditative practice.[16]
As users tilt the sculpture, sonic dissonance and spatial shifts
disrupt the tranquil background, encouraging reflection on phys-
ical and emotional balance.
3.3 Supplementary Media

4 EVALUATION: TEST PLAY SESSIONS
4.1 Methodology
This study aimed to evaluate the usability, creative potential,
and meditative suitability of the two instruments in the Har-
monix series, ZenithChimes and Equilibrio. Both instruments
were placed separately in an open venue, allowing participants to
freely approach and explore the setup without time restrictions
(Figure 3).
Figure 3: Test play setup of the Harmonix series
4.2 Participants
Ten participants took part in the study. Their backgrounds varied
as follows:
• 3 participants had formal musical training.
• 7 participants had no prior musical experience.
• 7 participants had experience with mindfulness practices
(e.g., yoga or meditation).
• All participants were aged between 20 and 40 years old.
This range of experiences enabled the study to gather insights
into the instruments’ ease of use, creative engagement, and suit-
ability for meditative contexts.
4.3 Procedure
Each participant received a brief 30-second instruction on how
to engage with the instruments:
• ZenithChimes: “You can touch the metal tape to produce
sound. ”
• Equilibrio: “You can tilt the ‘stone stack’ to explore the
sound. ”
Following this, participants were invited to freely explore the
instruments for approximately 10 minutes, either individually
or collaboratively. Their interactions were observed, and post-
session feedback was gathered through semi-structured inter-
views, using the following prompts:
• “Did you enjoy playing with the instrument?”
• “On a scale from 1 (very easy) to 10 (very difficult), how
difficult was it to learn?”
• “Did you feel relaxed while playing with the instrument?”
Observational notes and qualitative responses were docu-
mented during and after each session to assess experiential en-
gagement, learning curve, and perceived relaxation.
4.4 Results and Observations
4.4.1 User Enjoyment and Engagement. All 10 participants rated
the instruments as easy to use, assigning a score of 3 out of 10 or
lower on the difficulty scale, suggesting a low learning curve.
• 5 participants remarked that they could “play it all day”,
citing enjoyment of the sound produced.
• 8 participants found ZenithChimes especially easy to learn
and described it as enabling free creative expression.
• 3 participants felt that the use of pre-recorded sound in
Equilibrio limited their creative exploration, and suggested
future versions might benefit from user-controlled sound
parameters.
4.4.2 Potential for Musical and Mindfulness Applications.The
instruments showed promise for integration into both creative
and therapeutic settings:
• 2 participants, including a professional percussionist and
composer, expressed interest in incorporating ZenithChimes
into future compositions.
• 7 participants believed that both instruments would be
suitable for mindfulness and meditative practices, such
as yoga or guided relaxation, due to their calming sound-
scapes and engaging interfaces.
4.4.3 Instrument Aesthetics and Functionality.The participants
appreciated the aesthetic qualities and sculptural nature of the
instruments:
• 8 participants viewed Equilibrio as both a functional medi-
tative device and an aesthetically pleasing sound sculpture.
• 1 participant commented: "It’s something I’d love to have
at home, not just as a device, but as a decoration. "
5 DISCUSSION
5.1 Ease of Use, Engagement, and Creative
Potential
The design of ZenithChimes and Equilibrio prioritised simplicity
and immediacy in user interaction. This was reflected in partic-
ipant feedback: All users reported low difficulty, and 8 out of
10 found ZenithChimes particularly easy to learn. The familiar
actions of touching and tilting contributed to the ease of use
of the instruments, allowing participants without prior musical
training to engage with confidence and curiosity.
ZenithChimes’s layout, inspired by traditional piano keys, and
its intuitive touch-based interface supported spontaneous music-
making with minimal instruction. Similarly, Equilibrio’s tilt-based
interaction model, underpinned by passive conductivity sensing,
offered an embodied form of musical engagement, fostering a
tactile relationship between user and sound.
However, some participants noted limitations in creative free-
dom, particularly with Equilibrio’s pre-recorded soundscape.
While the instrument was appreciated for its aesthetic and medi-
tative qualities, this feedback suggests a trade-off between artistic
control and simplicity. Future iterations could explore incorpo-
rating modifiable or user-generated audio content to support a
broader range of expression.
5.2 Meditative and Aesthetic Value
Seven participants reported that the instruments would be suit-
able for integration into mindfulness practices such as yoga or

sound baths. This highlights the meditative potential of the Har-
monix series, particularly through the use of ambient sound-
scapes and calming physical gestures.
Equilibrio’s interaction design, where sonic dissonance in-
creases as the sculpture is tilted, was noted for its symbolic reflec-
tion of imbalance. This tension-disruption model mirrors themes
in mindfulness, where awareness of inner imbalance is often a
precursor to restoration. That the object could also serve as a
sound sculpture further underlines its hybrid nature, existing
between functional instrument and contemplative artwork.
5.3 Comparison to Related Work
The Harmonix series builds on existing explorations of digital
musical instruments for wellbeing, offering distinct contributions
in its emphasis on low learning curves, aesthetic design, and
minimal hardware barriers. In contrast to systems requiring steep
training or reliance on screens and controllers, these instruments
enable immediate interaction through familiar and accessible
actions.
ZenithChimes’s probabilistic tone mapping introduces com-
plexity without demanding musical expertise, creating space
for spontaneity within structured tonal parameters. Equilibrio,
meanwhile, combines panning and modulation in a single gesture,
offering an intuitive, embodied musical control mechanism.
While the instruments were not tested in ensemble settings,
their tonal design prioritises harmonic compatibility. Most notes
in ZenithChimes belong to a common scale and consonant inter-
vals, suggesting potential for group music-making. Future studies
could investigate this collaborative dimension more thoroughly.
5.4 Limitations and Challenges
Several limitations must be acknowledged. The participant group,
although varied in experience, was small (n = 10) and restricted
in age (20–40). No participants had physical disabilities, limiting
insight into the instruments’ physical accessibility. As such, this
study does not claim to fully address accessibility for all user
groups.
Additionally, sessions were conducted in an informal setting
rather than during structured meditative practices. While par-
ticipants reported feelings of relaxation, further investigation in
guided environments would provide more robust insights into
the instruments’ efficacy for mindfulness.
Finally, although the aesthetic and ambient qualities of Equilib-
rio were praised, some participants expressed a desire for greater
sonic control. Future developments may include adjustable sound
sources or interactive generative audio systems to support medi-
tative and expressive needs.
6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
This study introduced the Harmonix series, two Accessible Digital
Musical Instruments (ADMIs), designed to facilitate intuitive
music-making and promote mindful engagement. The design
of ZenithChimes and Equilibrio prioritises tactile interaction,
aesthetic quality, and ease of use, aiming to lower barriers for
users regardless of musical training.
6.1 Creative and Reflective Interaction
ZenithChimes enabled participants to quickly engage in musical
expression, offering a low learning curve and the harmonic sound
design that encouraged creativity without overwhelming the user.
Equilibrio, meanwhile, invited reflection through its tilt-based in-
teraction, creating an embodied relationship between movement
and sonic response. Although the instruments were not tested in
formal meditative or therapeutic settings, user feedback suggests
calming and engaging qualities that warrant further exploration.
6.2 Limitations and Research Opportunities
While the instruments showed promise, the scope of evaluation
was limited. The test sessions involved a small participant pool
(n = 10) within a narrow age range (20–40), and did not include
individuals with physical or neurodevelopmental conditions. Ad-
ditionally, all interactions took place in informal, individual set-
tings rather than structured meditation or ensemble contexts.
Future studies should explore these instruments in more diverse
and longitudinal settings to better assess their accessibility, ther-
apeutic potential, and collaborative capabilities.
6.3 Potential Applications
The Harmonix series sits at the intersection of art, technology,
and mindfulness, offering possibilities for wider applications:
(1) Therapeutic Use: While further validation is required,
participants’ responses suggest the instruments may hold
value in therapeutic contexts—particularly in supporting
stress reduction, emotional expression, and introspective
focus.
(2) Community and Educational Engagement: The sim-
ple interfaces and non-verbal modes of interaction may
suit creative workshops and inclusive environments, par-
ticularly those that encourage shared music-making and
emotional expression.
(3) Inclusive Music Technology: The use of capacitive touch
and passive tilt sensing enables interaction with minimal
physical effort, potentially making the instruments suit-
able for individuals with reduced motor control. However,
direct testing with these communities remains an impor-
tant next step.
6.4 Future Development
Looking ahead, several paths for advancement are envisioned:
(1) Expanded User Testing: Including older adults and indi-
viduals with diverse abilities to assess usability, engage-
ment, and emotional impact.
(2) Structured Context Trials: Deploying the instruments
in meditation sessions, therapy settings, or collaborative
sound-making workshops.
(3) Customisation and Multi-Sensory Feedback: Adding
user-controlled soundscape options, haptic feedback, or vi-
sual indicators to increase personalisation and immersive
experience.
(4) Material and Sustainability Improvements: Exploring
alternatives to 3D-printed PLA and acrylic by adopting
more durable and eco-friendly materials.
(5) Modular and Scalable Design: Investigating how instru-
ment components might be adapted or reconfigured to
serve different user needs or group formats.
In sum, the Harmonix series proposes a new model of accessi-
ble, reflective digital instrument design, one that values creativity,
simplicity, and mindful interaction. Although still in the early
stages of development and evaluation, the work lays a foundation

for continued exploration into how musical instruments can sup-
port well-being, connection, and creative expression in a range
of settings.
7 ETHICAL STANDARDS
This research was conducted as an independent study, and there-
fore no formal ethical approval was required. However, all ethical
principles regarding human participation were followed. Partic-
ipants were fully informed about the nature of the study and
verbal consent was obtained prior to participation. No personally
identifiable information was collected, and participants were free
to withdraw at any time. This study did not involve any financial
