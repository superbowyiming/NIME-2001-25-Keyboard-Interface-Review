ABSTRACT
Recent developments in music technology have enabled novel
timbres to be acoustically synthesized using various actua-
tion and excitation methods. Utilizing recent work in non-
linear acoustic synthesis, we propose a transducer based
augmented percussion implement entitled DRMMR. This
design enables the user to sustain computer sequencer-like
drum rolls at faster speeds while also enabling the user
to achieve nonlinear acoustic synthesis eﬀects. Our acous-
tic evaluation shows drum rolls executed by DRMMR eas-
ily exhibit greater levels of regularity, speed, and precision
than comparable transducer and electromagnetic-based ac-
tuation methods. DRMMR’s nonlinear acoustic synthe-
sis functionality also presents possibilities for new kinds of
sonic interactions on the surface of drum membranes.

1. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIV ATION
1.1 Introduction
DRMMR is an augmented percussion implement for mem-
brane actuation, shown in 1.1. Housed in a compact plas-
tic handle, DRMMR can be used as a hand-held or micro-
phone stand mountable percussion implement. This sonic
device incorporates two primary functions, achieving precise
hands-free drum rolls and nonlinear acoustic synthesis [4].
Due to the way DRMMR’s transducer-cantilever actuation
method interacts with the drum membrane, our system can
operate at broad frequency and amplitude ranges as com-
pared to single driver actuation methods.
Following a discussion of motivations, Section 2.1 deﬁnes
the characteristics of a human drum roll in order to pro-
vide a benchmark for evaluating the quality of DRMMR’s
rolls. In Section 2.2, we discuss previous work in augmented
instrument, followed by augmented implement research in

Section 2.3. We then discuss theory of operation in Sec-
tion 3). Sections 4 and 5 detail design considerations and
our experimental methods for comparing DRMMR against
other single driver actuation systems.

1.2 Motivation
The drum roll is a common method for achieving sustained
notes on drums. Our motivation is to mechanically sus-
tain various forms of drum rolls. To achieve this, we use
a transducer-cantilever based actuation method within a
hand-held augmented percussion implement. DRMMR en-
ables new timbral possibilities in sustained notes through
hands-free and human-controlled computer sequencer-like
drum rolls, and achieves sonic complexity via nonlinear acous-
tic synthesis on the surface of a drum head. When DRMMR
is used as a stand mountable device, DRMMR can also act
as an additional limb that enables increased polyrhythmic
and timbral complexity during a performance.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Characteristics of a Drum Roll
The characteristics of a high-quality drum roll include even-
ness between strokes, maintenance of the drum’s full spec-
tral proﬁle while rolling, and breadth of dynamic range [24].
Drum rolls are categorized either as an open roll and closed
roll, where an open roll is a rudimental roll of two beats
with each stick in alternation, and a closed roll possesses
several rebounds with each stick motion [24].
Maintaining a drum’s natural tone quality when perform-
ing a drum roll involves avoiding any slight interference that
inhibit a drum head’s ability to fully resonate. In other
116
words, the drum sticks should not dampen the drum head
in any way. Rolls that are too fast increase the length of
time that the sticks are touching the head, thus muﬄing the
drum’s tone [7]. Therefore, drummers often vary the roll
speed with the size of the drum to enable a given drum’s
full resonance.
Producing a roll at any tempo, dynamic, or dynamic
shape while maintaining stroke evenness and the drum’s
full resonant tone are the hallmarks of a musically expres-
sive drum roll. These characteristics are the benchmarks
by which we have conceptualized DRMMR’s design as an
augmented percussion implement that achieves expressive
computer sequencer-like drum rolls.
2.2 Augmented Percussion Instruments
Augmented instrument systems combining electronic sys-
tems into acoustic instruments is an expanding area in music
technology research and design [16, 18]. Generally, acous-
tic instrument actuation is achieved through either electro-
magnetic or mechanical transduction [23]. In particular, we
are interested in augmented percussion instruments utilizing
electronic actuators that strike, vibrate, bow, or brush drum
membranes using mechanical or electromagnetic transduc-
tion [2, 4, 8, 9, 22, 21]. By focusing on DRMMR’s applica-
tion as an implement rather than an instrument, DRMMR
can be used a modular device within many musical contexts.
This diﬀers from previous robotic and augmented percus-
sion instruments that operate either as a pseudo-speaker
object [19, 21] or as a stand-alone robotically actuated in-
strument [8, 9, 13, 14, 22].
2.3 Augmented Percussion Implements
An augmented percussion implement may consist of a drum
stick, mallet, brush, or beater. In this arrangement, the im-
plement becomes a modular object the drummer uses to di-
rectly play or interact with the percussion instrument itself,
as opposed to autonomous robotic systems. Early research
in the domain of augmented implements focused on the con-
trol of virtual processes. Examples include Max Matthew’s
MIDI compatible Radio Baton , and Roberto Aimi’s real-
time convolution implement controllers [3, 2]. Recent aug-
mented implement research has focused more on the acous-
tic actuation of instruments. This includes Patricia Alessan-
drini’s work Tracer la lune d’un doigt , which incorporates
the use of a custom glove implement that uses ”tiny acrylic
ﬁngers”to sustain piano strings [17]. Steven Kemper’s multi-
Mallet Automatic Drumming Instrument and Conﬁgurable
Automatic Drumming Instrument use standard drummer
implements attached to robotic arms that actuate percus-
sion instruments [13, 14]. Electromagnetic actuation meth-
ods have produced implements such as the hand-held EBow,
enabling electronic guitars to sustain a note indeﬁnitely [11].
Many composers and augmented instrument practitioners
actuate percussion instruments by driving a surface exciter
placed on the drum membrane [6]. Another commonly used
technique involves using a microphone as a type of pseudo-
implement to produce and control self-oscillating feedback
with a surface transducer placed on an instrument’s res-
onating surface. The Bi-stable Resonator Cymbal and Metal
Mirror are examples of systems using microphone-transducer
self-oscillating feedback as a controllable pseudo-implement [19,
23].
3. THEORY OF OPERATION
Nonlinear acoustic synthesis techniques provide the means
to produce intermittent and time-varying control of sounds
in musical instruments [4, 5]. Our approach extends recent
methods utilizing a transducer-cantilever system [25] by ex-
ploiting the high spring-forces of a snare drum head for the
purpose of generating a stable-state drum roll. Speciﬁcally,
we characterize the behavior between the drum membrane
and cantilever, or snare drum and DRMMR, as a lumped-
element model with multiple spring-mass components sim-
ilar to the free body mass-spring model described in [10].
The DRMMR system can therefore be described using the
Kuramoto Model of coupled phase oscillators [1]. Equa-
tion 1 describes the dynamics in a Kuramoto system with
N coupled phase oscillators θi(t) as:
˙θ= ωi + K
N
N∑
j=1
sin(θj−θi),i = 1,...,N (1)
where K is the coupling constant, and ωi are the natu-
ral frequencies of the phase oscillators. However, when an
external driver is applied to this system, we assume that
the constant K is of suﬃciently large value resulting in a
full phase-locking scenario, akin to ”chaos destroying” syn-
chronization that occurs as a result of application of a peri-
odic force on a chaotic system resulting in a new emergent
periodic behavior [20]. Given this condition, it has been
shown that the Kuramoto Equation 1 reduces to simply the
weighted sum of the natural frequencies of the phase oscil-
lators [15]. This in turn allows us to deﬁne a new quantity,
the mean natural frequency of the the entire system, ϖ as:
ϖ= ˙θ= 1
N
N∑
j=1
ωj (2)
It is further noted that in phase-locking conditions, all
oscillators have a phase velocity equal to the mean natural
frequency ϖof the entire system [15]. In the stand-mounted
DRMMR snare drum conﬁguration, this implies the drive
frequencies necessary for generating stable drum rolls will
diﬀer from the frequency proﬁle of the drum resonator. In
our evaluation of DRMMR, we found that the mean funda-
mental drive frequency of DRMMR was 311 .5Hz, whereas
the snare drum fundamental frequency was 304 .5Hz. This
result is consistent with [15] and is notable because it would
seem more intuitive that a primary resonator should, as the
main contributor of frequency components, determine the
resonance proﬁle of the entire system.
This theory illustrates why stable drum rolls are possible
in our system, and more broadly that systems with mul-
tiple coupled mechanical oscillators are capable of rapidly
entering a phase-locked condition when driven with periodic
external actuation.
4. DRMMR: INTERFACE AND DESIGN
DRMMR is both a hand-held and stand-mountable aug-
mented percussion implement that can be used with any
audio source and external control device. Based on the au-
thor’s respective experiences as a percussionist and com-
poser, our design goal is provide the user with inﬁnite cre-
ative possibilities for using DRMMR within any musical
situation. Below are just a few example’s based on the au-
thor’s experimental usage of DRMMR as a percussionist:
1. Hand-held
(a) Using one DRMMR in one hand to create a drum
roll or nonlinear acoustic synthesis eﬀect while
performing other musical gestures in their other
hand.
117
Figure 2: DRMMR in the stand mounted conﬁguration with a snare drum.
(b) Using two DRMMRs to create densely complex,
sustained timbres on multiple drums using non-
linear acoustic synthesis.
(c) Using two DRMMRs to create multi-voice
polyrhythms at speeds faster than humanly pos-
sible.
2. Stand Mounted
(a) Drum-set player mounting a DRMMR for each of
their drums, and controlling the DRMMRs auto-
mated mean, therefore generating many layers of
complex acoustic polyphony.
(b) Many DRMMRs mounted on various drums through-
out a multi-percussion set-up and using foot con-
trollers to control the DRMMRs while using their
hands for other musical tasks.
(c) Multiple DRMMRs mounted on various drums
and using MIDI drum pads to trigger various
drum rolls, rhythmic gestures, or nonlinear acous-
tic synthesis eﬀects freely during a performance.
Figure 3 shows a labeled proﬁle of DRMMR. The mount-
able handle was fabricated using a Prusa i3 MK3 3D printer,
and is made from black PET grade plastic ﬁlament. A Day-
ton Audio DAEX25 transducer is attached to the end of
the plastic handle using very high bond double sided tape
with the transducer’s driver facing downwards towards the
cantilever. The end of the cantilever is also attached to the
transducer using very high bond double sided tape. A small
piece of foam is situated at the rear of the cantilever beneath
the transducer. This foam functions as a spring that sta-
bilizes and counteracts the spring force generated by the
cantilever and drum head interaction. A piece of moleskin
is applied to the cantilever’s tip to soften the attack of the
metal, and to protect the drum head from damage.
Our particular implementation of DRMMR in the video
abstract is driven using a sine-tone generator. The trans-
ducer’s audio cables run through a hollow section of the
plastic handle and out to an ampliﬁer driving the trans-
ducer. The ampliﬁer is fed a mono audio signal from a
digital sine tone oscillator in which the user can control the
oscillator’s frequency, amplitude, and amplitude envelopes
using any physical control interface or automated control
functionality. In this implementation, we used a simple foot-
switch to DRMMR’s amplitude envelopes and an expression
pedal to control DRMMR’s frequency.
Figure 3: DRMMR: Individually labeled design
components.
4.1 Sonic Control
The attributes of the cantilever enables DRMMR to expres-
sively achieve the characteristics of computer sequencer-like
open rolls. When DRMMR’s oscillation speed is driven at
higher frequencies DRMMR becomes out of phase with the
resonate oscillation speed of the drum head, and DRMMR
begins to produce sustained nonlinear acoustic synthesis,
which can be used as an expressive timbral variant to the
standard sustained drum roll.
When using lower sine-wave oscillation frequencies to drive
the transducer, DRMMR can generate computer sequencer-
like open rolls at a wide variety of speeds and dynamics, as
well as an approximation of a closed roll. In one example of
an open roll, shown in Figure 6, the driver’s frequency is set
to 9 Hz. DRMMR also demonstrates its ability to produce
a closed roll when its frequency parameter is set higher, in
this case, 169 Hz Figure 6. Comparing the waveforms of
DRMMR’s drum roll to the human drum rolls in Figure 6,
demonstrates that DRMMR’s rolls are indeed more precise
and dynamically even that the human roll, resulting in a
sound more like a computer sequenced roll than a human
roll. In the case of the speciﬁc drum used in our tests, when
118
the transducer-cantilever was driven in the frequency range
of 540Hz to 681Hz the drum exhibited the sonic qualities
of nonlinear acoustic synthesis [4], shown in Figure 4.1.

response of a snare drum when driving DRMMR
with an exponential chirp in a range of 1Hz to 2kHz.

cies of 540Hz and 681Hz as pictured here
5. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Our experimental methods compared our proposed transducer-
cantilever actuation system against common single-driver
actuation alternatives, such as mechanical and electromag-
netic transduction techniques. These tests determined how
well each of these transduction methods accurately pro-
duced a clean and even drum rolls at varying speeds and dy-
namics. We omitted two alternative drive methods: solenoids
and robotic percussion systems. In the case of solenoids,
they have been shown to have low drive frequencies and not
suitable for drum rolls [12]. For robotic systems, we felt
that the complexity resulting from multi-driver or complex
gear systems was not a fair comparison to a single-driver
system [14, 22].
5.1 Drum Actuator Comparison Set-up
To evaluate each actuation method, we designed a mount-
ing device that enabled the mechanical and electromagnetic
methods to interact with the drum head in a similar man-
ner to the transducer-cantilever method. For the mechan-
ical actuation we used a Dayton Audio DAEX25 trans-
ducer, and for the electromagnetic transduction we used
an e−77 −82 −35 tubular electromagnetic from Magnetic
Sensor Systems. Since the transducer-cantilever device is
housed in a plastic handle, the transducer-cantilever does
not move around the drum while actuating. If the mechan-
ical or electromagnetic actuators are not mounted in a sim-
ilar way, they would chaotically bounce around the drum
head and thereby sacriﬁce the tone quality and evenness
of the drum roll. By mounting the mechanical and elec-
tromagnetic transducers, these devices actuate the drum
in precisely the same location as the mounted transducer-
cantilever.
Mounting the mechanical and electromagnetic transduc-
ers was also in eﬀort to minimize the length of time these
devices muﬄed the drum head during actuation. If the me-
chanical and electromagnetic transducers were to be sim-
ply placed on the drum-head during actuation, they would
muﬄe the drum’s full resonate capabilities. This mount-
ing device allows for the mechanical and electromagnetic
transducers to actuate the drum from a higher plane, a fair
comparison to DRMMR’s placement above the drum head.
5.2 Variable Amplitude-Frequency Experiment
Each transduction method was tested for its ability to
produce a drum roll at various roll speeds and dynamics.
Figure 5: Drum Actuator Comparison: Top image-
transducer, Bottom image-electromagnet
To test various roll-speeds, we drove each actuator with an
exponential series of nineteen discrete sine-tones with fre-
quencies between 1 Hz and 361 Hz. Each sine tone was
generated for four seconds followed by four seconds of si-
lence. After each composite eight-second routine, the next
discrete frequency in the exponential series was used as the
sine-tone’s frequency. In terms of amplitude, the volume of
the sine-tones were empirically adjusted to obtain relative
perceptual estimations of three dynamic levels on the drum,
Piano, Mezzo Forte, and Forte.
6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
6.1 Drum Actuator Comparison Experiment
Table 1 details the performance of DRMMR in the Variable
Amplitude-Frequency Experiment detailed in Section 5.2.
Our results show that DRMMR executes drum rolls that
adhere to the characteristics of a high-quality drum roll,
discussed in Section 2.1, with computer-like precision bet-
ter than the other testes actuation methods at all three
dynamic levels. It is agreed upon by drummers of all styles
that an open or closed drum roll must have ”evenness be-
tween each stroke and a smooth sustain” at all dynamic
levels while maintaining the natural tone of the drum to
be considered a high quality roll [24, 26]. In equation 3, a
successful roll was determined by a consistent ”even” and
”smooth” quality when evaluated empirically through criti-
cal listening. Table 6.1 shows the ratio of successful drum
rolls from each actuation method at various dynamic levels.
In terms of nonlinear acoustic synthesis, DRMMR was the
only actuator able to produce this eﬀect due to the ﬁndings
in [4].

Table 1: Comparison of drum rolls at relative dy-
namic levels between DRMMR, surface transducer,
and electromagnetic actuators.
6.1.1 Open Rolls
The waveforms in Figure 6 clearly show that DRUMMR’s
open roll, compared to the transducer and electromagnet,
has a more dynamically stable and temporally regular tran-
sient response. The transducer’s lack of stability and large
striking surface resulted in a uneven and muﬄed open stroke
roll. The electromagnet was unable to produce an open roll
due to its inability to resonate the drum head below 121Hz.
6.1.2 Closed Rolls
While DRMMR and the transducer’s closed roll waveforms
look more similar than the open roll waveforms, DRMMR
demonstrates more dynamic stability and and smoothness
for the same reasons discussed in 6.1.1. While the elec-
tromagnet did produce substantial sound when driven at
higher frequencies, the sound produced was a byproduct
of the driver frequency and possessed no characteristics of
either an open or closed drum roll shown in Figure 6.
6.1.3 Tone Quality
DRMMR’s transducer-cantilever method of actuation was
superior to maintaining the drum’s natural tone quality
throughout the drum roll. This is due to the cantilever’s
elasticity, and subsequent ability to rebound oﬀ of the drum
head quick enough to not dampen the drum’s resonance.
The transducer’s large actuation surface, and lack of re-
bound ability eﬀectively muﬄes the drum head during ac-
tuation. Figure 7 compares a single drum strike executed
by DRMMR and a standard transducer actuation method.
It is clear from these spectrograms that DRMMR enables
the drum’s natural resonate frequencies to resonate stronger
and longer than the transducer. The transducer dampens
many of the drum’s resonate frequencies, thus causing the
drum’s tone to die out around 1 .3 seconds while the can-
tilever enables the drum’s resonance to last approximately
2.2 seconds, shown in Figure 6.1.3.
7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
DRMMR is a new augmented percussion implement that
better achieves better computer sequencer-like drum rolls as
compared to other single-driver actuation methods.1 In ad-
dition to improved functionality our system is simpler, and
due to its modular capabilities, DRMMR can be employed

in a broader range of contexts compared with multi-driver
robotic systems. DRMMR also allows users to employ non-
linear acoustic synthesis techniques at higher drive frequen-
cies.
Future work includes designing and fabricating cantilevers
that use diﬀerent materials for their tips as such as wood,
felt, and steel. These cantilevers will be interchangeable
within DRUMMR, as to give the user more timbral choices.
While the proposed DRMMR system is mainly designed for
small drums such as toms and snare drums, future variants
will include transducer-cantilever actuators for large drums
such as timpani and bass drums, and for various sized cym-
bals.
