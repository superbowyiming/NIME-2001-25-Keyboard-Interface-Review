ABSTRACT
The Feedback Cello is a new electroacoustic actuated instru-
ment in which feedback can be induced independently on
each string. Built from retro-ﬁtted acoustic cellos, the sig-
nals from electromagnetic pickups sitting under each string
are passed to a speaker built into the back of the instru-
ment and to transducers clamped in varying places across
the instrument body. Placement of acoustic and mechanical
actuators on the resonant body of the cello mean that this
simple analogue feedback system is capable of a wide range
of complex self-resonating behaviours. This paper describes
the motivations for building these instruments as both a
physical extension to live coding practice and an electroa-
coustic augmentation of cello. The design and physical con-
struction is outlined, and modes of performance described
with reference to the ﬁrst six months of performances and
installations. Future developments and planned investiga-
tions are outlined.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Feedback Cello project is a collaboration between Halld´ or
´Ulfarsson, Alice Eldridge and Chris Kiefer. ´Ulfarsson is
an artist and designer who has been developing a cello-like
feedback instrument – the halldorophone – over the last
decade; Eldridge is an improvising cellist who works with
adaptive dynamical systems in electroacoustic performance;
and Kiefer is a computer-musician who works with gestu-
ral controllers and dynamical systems. Following the de-
sign of the halldorophone, the self-resonating behaviour of
the Feedback Cello is induced by acoustic and vibrational
actuation: the signals from pickups under each string are
sent to a speaker built into the back of the instrument, and

a vibrational transducer ﬁxed on the front. The complex
response of the resonating acoustic body of the cello cre-
ates wide timbral variation, and individual gain control on
each pickup aﬀords rich interaction. In performance, the
instrument can be approached from a variety of angles; it
can be played as an augmented cello using traditional bow
and ﬁnger control, with additional gain control using foot
pedals; it can be played through manipulation of external
live-coded digital signal processing which alter the charac-
teristics of the feedback loop; or it can play autonomously
using adaptive DSP processes in installation settings.
The Feedback Cello can be positioned at the nexus of
contemporary acoustic, gestural practices and digital, gen-
erative practices: as an electroacoustic feedback instrument,
the cello brings analogue, generative processes into the ex-
tended string tradition; as a resonant signal generator and
modulator, it provides a lively gestural interface to digital
music and live-coding. The design, construction and exper-
imental use of the instrument serve as a practice-based ex-
ploration of the similarities and diﬀerences between as well
as a new synthesis of gestural and generative improvisation
practices which are traditionally associated with acoustic
and software instruments respectively.
The project is ongoing and purposefully advances in iter-
ative cycles of instrument design and performance practice
development. Within this project these two practices are so
closely interlinked that they are arguably facets of a wider
artistic practice exploring methods for situated, open-ended
experimental instrument design. We begin to document
this ongoing process in this paper. Whilst the instruments
themselves are evolving to ﬁt our very personal performance
interests, it is our intention to open-source any reusable de-
sign patterns as they emerge and to contribute to a growing
community of musician-makers interested in feedback res-
onator instruments.
2. RELATED WORK
The use of feedback to enrich timbre or enliven electroa-
coustic or digital systems has a long history in art and
experimental musics. A staple of American experimental-
ists in the 1950s, simple sinusoidal electroacoustic feed-back
was explored by David Tudor [11], Alvin Lucier and others.
More complex, dynamic and adaptive ‘architectural’ feed-
back systems were explored by the next generation, epito-
mised by the self-stabilising circuitry of Nick Collin’s Pea
Soup (1974 -76; 2002). The beguiling balance of adaptation
and autonomy of such systems was championed poetically
by Augustino Di Scipio [3] who has inspired another gen-
eration of artists and performers, designing and describing
adaptive DSP processes in terms of second-order cybernetic
principles of adaptation and coupling [12].

Various string instruments have been developed in recent
years in which sound can be induced without striking or
bowing, using electromagnets to excite the strings, as in the
Feedback Resonance Guitar [10] or the Magnetic Resonator
Piano (MRP) [8]. Mechanical excitation has also been ex-
plored, either via a vibrational transducer on the bridge, as
in the Feedback Lapsteel [6] or the body of the instrument
directly as in the Overtone ﬁddle [9]. The Feedback Cello
extends this approach and uses mounted tactile transducers
together with a speaker built into the back of the instru-
ment. It is part of a wider community of feedback actuated
instruments being developed by contemporary experimental
performers and instrument makers both within and beyond
academia. For example it has been programmed alongside
Andrew McPherson’s MRP as well as Till Boverman’s min-
imal Half-closed Loop [2] and Thrainn Hjalmarsson’s Thra-
nophone #21. Half-closed loop is comprised of a string in-
side a brass tube which is ﬁtted with a transducer pick-up,
the signal is heavily processed and sent back to actuators
ﬁtted onto a hardwood board on which it rests, creating an
only-just controllable complex system. The Thranophone
#2 is a feedback tuba; a microphone inside the performer’s
mouth is sent to a speaker mounted in the tuba bell, ef-
fectively coupling and amplifying the resonant chambers of
the Tuba and the performer’s mouth cavity, which acts as
a ﬁlter. Together these instruments developing traditional
acoustic performance practices in new directions; although
demanding equal if not more advanced technical skill, the
performer’s relationship with the instrument is evolving to
become one of negotiation, rather than control.
3. DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION
The basic design is inspired by the halldorophone of Halld´ or
´Ulfarsson. As shown in Figure 1, vibrations of the strings
are picked up by electromagnetic pickups, ampliﬁed and
sent to a speaker built into the back of the instrument –
and optionally a transducer braced against the front of the
cello – which excites the body, bridge and hence strings of
the instrument.

3.1 Design and Fitting of Pickups
An electromagnetic pickup is ﬁtted under each string, housed
in a bespoke 3D printed mount (see Figure 3). These CycFi2
pickups have a built in pre-amp and a ﬂat response, creating
a clear tone with steel core cello strings. The pickup mount
is designed to clamp onto the end of the ﬁngerboard, allow-
ing rotational and height adjustment of each pickup. This is
important as the feedback tones produced are very sensitive
to positioning, with changes of a few milllimeters aﬀecting
which harmonic dominates.
3.2 Actuators
Feedback is induced via mechanical and acoustic processes:
a vibrational transducer is ﬁtted on the front of the instru-
ment; a speaker is built into the back of the instrument.
Transducers are clamped with plywood braces to allow vari-
ation and ﬁne tuning of positioning as this has a big impact
on dynamical response of the system and resultant sound.
Speakers are ﬁtted into holes cut in the lower half of the
back cello body (Figure 7). To guard against tearing the
bodies, and to maximise vibrational conduction between
the curved cello body and ﬂat speaker, collars were cut
from spruce on a CNC machine and hand sanded to ﬁt
the three-dimensional curvature of the cellos. Collars were
glued (using Titebond III) to the surfaces of the cellos and
50W 8Ω Monacor SP 50-X speaker bolted on, using a ply-
wood reinforcement internally to house the bolts. A hole
was drilled in the collar for the speaker cable, to prevent
vibration against the body during performance.

cello body, mounted on a spruce collar to maximise
vibrational conductance.
3.3 External Connections/ Gain control
The instrument has individual gain control for each pickup,
so four ‘output’ channels. To date we have explored two
options for gain control: through an analogue mixer and
pedals, or via a digital audio interface into SuperCollider
for digital and programmatic control. The combined pickup
signal is then further ampliﬁed in a 50W 2x2 channel Sony
car stereo ampliﬁer, before being sent to the speaker and
transducer. Either set-up creates an opportunity to add
additional audio signals to the mix (see section 4.4). The
car ampliﬁer is selected because of its portability - both
physically and in operating at 12V.

4. PERFORMANCE MODES
The Feedback Cello aﬀords a range of possible modes of in-
teraction – gestural, digital and combinations of the two.
The system as a whole – strings, resonating cello body, pick
ups, speaker – can be best understood as a dynamical sys-
tem where the dominant feedback tone is one of a number of
possible attractors. The state space – and therefore acous-
tic behaviour – of the instrument is determined collectively
by three main factors: i) the positioning of the pickups,
transducer and speaker; ii) the tuning (open, stopped or
damped) of the strings; iii) the gains, colour and frequency
of the signal sent to the speaker. To date we have ﬁxed (i)
and focused on technical and musical explorations of string
(ii) and signal (iii) manipulation, with our approaches in-
formed predominantly by our practices as a cellist and as a
live coder.
4.1 Adaptive DSP in Installation
In installation, the cellos are controlled algorithmically. In-
stalled as a durational drone duet for no cellists, we exper-
imented with a variety of adaptive DSP processes to dif-
ferentially condition the signals of each cello in response
to environmental sound. Just as two acoustic cellos played
in the same space induce vibrations in the other, in this
set-up the cello’s interact acoustically, as well as digitally,
responding to each other, as well as other sounds in the
environment.

Process, Newhaven, 2016
4.2 Extending Extended Cello Technique
The Feedback Cello looks like a cello, but the self-resonating
behaviour demands and inspires new extended technique.
Bowing or ﬁngering the cello in a traditional manner inter-
rupts the vibrating strings and so are largely avoided, but
new sensitives and sonic possibilities arise. For example
the distance from string to pickup becomes a new ‘control
parameter’, and combined with sensitive gain adjustment
(via footpedals) aﬀords an expressive range of amplitude
and tone from dulcet tones to quite bright, harsh yelps.
Whilst traditional ﬁngering in the left hand interrupts a
self-sustaining string, this opens a new sensitivity to glis-
sandi actions, which can be manipulated to create complex
timbres reminiscent of overblown woodwind.
The sustained oscillations created by the feedback also
enable new percussive preparations: bolts, sticks or other
objects stuck between the strings can be set in continuous
motion, and drift along strings toward nodes of vibration

4.3 Live Coding the Feedback Cello
The signal pathway for the live-coder runs from pick-ups
through an audio interface into SuperCollider before be-
ing sent to the in-built speaker and transducer. In Su-
perCollider we can monitor incoming signals and explore
mechanisms for exciting and damping the strings. A Watt
governor-like [1] process has been developed which attempts
to continually push the system towards saturation; the sig-
nals from the pickups are individually processed and summed,
and then scaled by the inverse integral of the signal. This
gives rise to dynamics where frequencies battle for domi-
nance; it forces the system to become highly sensitive to
subtle changes in the feedback loop, and these changes tend
to result in the system moving to new points of stability or
in oscillation between attractors. A multichannel frequency-
shifter patch creates rhythmic pulsation as out of phase fre-
quencies interact with resonances of the strings. In another
patch, synthesized sound is injected into the system via a
ducking compressor, creating interactions between the digi-
tal sound and acoustic feedback. To create rhythmic sound,
the feedback can be limited or enhanced through sequenced
gating. When live coded, the strings become a delicate and
nuanced interface for manipulation of the instrument, with
subtle touch and damping actions bearing a large inﬂuence
on the system. The instrument presents a rich, tactile and
complex interface to more abstract digital processes.
4.4 Multi-instrument Acoustic Networks
It is of course possible to send the cello signals other than
those emanating from its pickups. We are currently experi-
menting with multi-instrument, multichannel feedback trio
for two Feedback Cellos and Threnoscope [5]. The Threno-
scope is a software compositional system created by ixi au-
dio for drones, live coding and microtonal, spatialised com-
position [7] which has multichannel outputs. The Threno-
scope’s N outputs are diﬀused across a multichannel (N-
2) system and the two Feedback Cello’s in built speakers.
This aﬀects the resonant response of the instrument, and at
the same time changes the resultant Threnoscope output.
In this setting three people perform on three instruments
which form a single dynamical drone system that has a de-
cided liveliness of its’ own: everybody is playing, nobody is
in control.
5. FUTURE PLANS
The next phase of instrument design will focus on further
exploration of pickup and transducer positioning, possibili-
ties for adding another set of sympathetic strings, and meth-

ods for on-body gestural gain controllers. New approaches
to continuous, adaptive tuning are also being considered by
replacing the traditional wooden cello pegs with machine
heads which can be mechanically and therefore program-
matically controlled. Current software developments in-
clude machine listening (frequency and amplitude) to achieve
tighter control in the feedback loop, and facilitate inclusion
of various complex and adaptive dynamical system models
of homeostasis and entrainment etc [4].
6. SUMMARY
This paper outlines the motivation for and design, construc-
tion and performance possibilities of the Feedback Cello,
a self-resonating, actuated instrument. The cello is ac-
tivated by sending the signals of pickups mounted under
each string to a built-in speaker and on-body transducer.
It contributes to a growing family of self-resonating musi-
cal instruments which embrace the musical agency of elec-
tromechanical feedback system, and connects this ﬁeld with
the long history of experimental, extended string techniques
and more recently evolving live-coding practice. A range of
modes of interaction and performance are described and fu-
ture directions outlined.
